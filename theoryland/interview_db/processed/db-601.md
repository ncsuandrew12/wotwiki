## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are also a couple of other updates.
*Towers of Midnight*
has made it to the semifinals of Audible's
[Tournament of Audiobooks](http://www.audible.com/tournament)
, but it is currently behind in votes to
*Matterhorn*
by Karl Marlantes. If you liked the
*Towers of Midnight*
audiobook,
[consider giving it your vote](http://www.pliner.net/apppoll2/123918f/)
. (Of course you can vote for
*Matterhorn*
instead, if you think that was a better audiobook.)

The
[Stormlight Archive character name auction](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/978/Appear-in-the-Sequel-to-THE-WAY-OF-KINGS)
is still going on. The local newspaper
[did an article on it](http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/article_71e93f77-f69e-57b7-bf9b-0390bafc17d0.html)
.

I haven't linked this week's Writing Excuses podcast episode yet. Recent episodes were recorded at LTUE when I was at ConDFW, so I haven't been appearing, but this episode marks my return. Dan Wells, Howard Tayler, and I
[talk about urban fantasy](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/04/10/)
