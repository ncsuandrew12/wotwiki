## Entry #1

#### Kara

I was there! and I flew in from Houston for it. Joseph-Beth was a wonderful bookstore and the event was so much fun.

## Entry #2

#### Kara

#### Brandon Sanderson

One funny story, the guy in front of me gets to the table and has the three WOT books that Brandon worked on, when Brandon opens
*The Gathering Storm*
, he says "Did you know you had
*Fires of Heaven*
in the Gathering Storm cover?" Brandon said he would not sign the bookâ€”I'm still not sure if the guy did that on purpose.

## Entry #3

#### Kara

#### Harriet McDougal

The other thing I remember is when Harriet was talking about supporting bookstores like Joseph-Beth, she said "you can't sit in the middle of Amazon".

## Entry #4

#### Kara

I waited around with newly made friends after the first round of signings so that we could go back for the personalizations from Brandon (we had a very nice dinner together at the bistro there). I told Brandon that I had read and loved Patrick Rothfuss based on his recommendation and asked him for books that he loved to read. He was nice enough to write down a few names.
