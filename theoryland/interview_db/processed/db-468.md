## Entry #1

#### Question

What's the status of the WoT movie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Universal has bought the rights for it, and they're in the process of writing a script. Maria is the official contact point for making sure they get the details right. Brandon is plenty busy writing, so he hasn't been involved.

#### Question

Is there a WoT MMORPG coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Red Eagle has the rights to create WoT video games, and they're working on some.

## Entry #3

#### Question

Were you surprised when you found out who killed Asmodean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon had been a fan for a long time before he got to find out who killed Asmodean. He said that he had heard arguments for every possible suspect, including the really crazy ones like Tam. So when he found out the real answer, he wasn't shocked. His reaction was more "Oh, those guys were right". He said that the clues are there, but he never would have figured it out himself.

## Entry #4

#### Question

Was Taim turned by a circle of thirteen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. I will say that he was never a very nice guy.

#### Footnote

It was made clear in
*Towers of Midnight*
that it's difficult to mistake someone who has been Turned for a normal person. They are uniformly inhuman, and this explains why they have not been Turning channelers all along; it is clear there is something wrong with them.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Slayer made a gateway in Far Madding when he tried to kill Rand and Min. Does this mean he uses the True Power to make his gateways?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Slayer does not channel. His powers come from somewhere other than the Source. Slayer is not affected by the Guardian in much the same way that Perrin wouldn't be.

#### Footnote

Slayer didn't make a gateway; he just 'stepped out' of
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. The person who gave his orders did make a gateway, to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
.

## Entry #6

#### Brandon Sanderson

The change in Mat's personality that many of us noticed in
*The Gathering Storm*
was deliberate. He's reacting to being married, which was the last thing he thought would happen to him. RJ's notes said specifically that "Mat refuses to become husbandly", and he's doing that by trying to go back to how he was in
*The Dragon Reborn*
. This is part of where the silliness with the backstories comes from—he knows that he was less serious and more of a joker at the time, but can't really get back to how he was then.

When he was writing Talmanes, Maria mentioned that Talmanes doesn't usually mock Mat in the earlier books. Brandon said that he has always read Talmanes that way, and that's what he finds so funny about it—Mat doesn't realize he's being teased.

#### Question

Do the Seanchan consider the raid on the White Tower a success?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, they consider it a success, but they're disappointed that they didn't get their hands on the Aes Sedai superweapon.

## Entry #8

#### Question

Will Moiraine be rescued in the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that Moiraine will be rescued.

#### Question

Will Moiraine's rescue attempt be in the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that Thom and Mat will attempt to rescue Moiraine. (I'll tell you, he's as bad as an Aes Sedai.)

#### Question

What will be the focus of the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This book really needed to focus on Egwene and Rand, and get their stories moving. There was also a nice contrast between their arcs in this book, with Egwene's going upwards and Rand's downward. The next book will be much broader in scope—we need to see what's going on with a lot of different parts of the story. There will be a lot more Mat and Perrin than in this one. I suppose you could say that if there was going to be a rescue attempt, the logical place to put it would be in a book with a lot of Mat.

#### Question

Will we see what's going on at the Black Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We'll see whether that fits in or not.

## Entry #10

#### Question

Will Fain be in the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Padan Fain will be seen again. He's a mixture of two things—Mordeth's power, which he got by seeking out all of the evil things that weren't related to the Shadow, and the Dark One's Hound. Brandon said that Fain's number one goal is to kill Rand, and a close second is to kill the Dark One. Now that Shadar Logoth has been destroyed, all of the Mordeth power that remains in the world is in Fain.

## Entry #11

#### Question

It's pretty clear now that Moridin and Rand are linked because of the balefire incident. Since Rand used
*saidin*
to create the balefire, and now he gets sick when channeling
*saidin*
, does that mean Moridin gets sick when he tries to use the True Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that Rand's channeling sickness comes from crossing the streams.

#### Footnote

From
*Knife of Dreams*
Chapter 21, "Within the Stone":

> The face of the man from Shadar Logoth floated in his head for a moment. He looked furious. And near to sicking up.

## Entry #12

#### Question

After Rand has channeled the True Power, he has a dark cloud around him. When he meets with Tuon after this, she manages to resist his
*ta'veren*
pull. Is this because the True Power has reduced his
*ta'veren*
mojo?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The reason she manages to resist is that she has a lot of willpower. Rand is just as
*ta'veren*
as ever.

#### Question

How about the food going bad in Bandar Eban? Was that caused by Rand being nearby with his cloud of evil?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We've heard earlier in the books that the Dragon is one with the land, and the land is one with the Dragon. This is an old belief—many kingdoms believed that the wellness of the king was directly tied to the wellness of the land. In WoT, this is quite literally true.

## Entry #13

#### Question

In Falme we saw Rand fighting Ishamael and the Heroes of the Horn and the Seanchan were mirroring the progress of the battle. Does this mean that there is something inherently evil about the Seanchan Empire?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nobody in WoT is inherently evil, except for Shadowspawn. At the time, the Seanchan were being led by a Darkfriend.

## Entry #14

#### Question

Was the Domination Band made of
*cuendillar*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The original one is made of
*cuendillar*
. The one that was destroyed was a copy, but one would assume that the copies are made of
*cuendillar*
, too. The True Power works by destroying the Pattern. Everything that is done with it involves damage to the Pattern. For example, when we see Ishamael Travel, he does so by poking a hole in the Pattern.
*Cuendillar*
can be destroyed using the True Power. There is another way to destroy
*cuendillar*
, too.

#### Footnote

Brandon said in
[another interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#10)
that the second way
*cuendillar*
can be destroyed is by the unraveling Pattern.

## Entry #15

#### Question

Is Mesaana still in the Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Egwene makes some deductions about this at the end of the book. Egwene is not incorrect.

#### Question

She could swear that she's not a Darkfriend on the Oath Rod, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As long as she believed it to be true. Every remaining Aes Sedai in the Tower has retaken the Three Oaths. You should be thinking about ways to defeat the Oath Rod. There is a way to do it.

## Entry #16

#### Question

At the Darkfriend Social, Carridin is given orders by Ishamael that he can't remember. Later on in Ebou Dar, he sees Mat out the window and he sort of goes into a trance, sees more imagery, and when he snaps out of it, time is stopped and Sammael is in the room. How did this happen? Was Sammael paged somehow when Carridin's orders were triggered?

#### Brandon Sanderson

MAFO—Maria and find out. This means he will answer the question, but he wants to check with Maria first to make sure he has the details straight.

#### [Maria Simons (via Luckers)](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/46013-mafo-answers/)

No, Sammael was not paged. Sammael had sent Carridin to Ebou Dar to find the cache of Power goodies. The notes say that Sammael became aware that there were other parties engaged in the same search, and decided that he had to light a fire under Carridin. Also note Sammael’s reaction to the news that Mat is in Ebou Dar—"'Here?" Oddly, for a moment, Sammael seemed taken aback". It seems to accentuate that Sammael is surprised; if he had been paged, it seems that his answer would have been different.

## Entry #17

#### Question

After Moiraine uses balefire on the Darkhounds in
*The Dragon Reborn*
, she says something about how she's much more dangerous now than when she met Perrin in Emond's Field. How did she become more dangerous?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a couple of ways she might mean that she has become more dangerous. Think about this—when she went to Emond's Field, she thought Rand was the Dragon. Now she knows that he's the Dragon. That in itself, combined with the fact that she's Blue makes her much more dangerous.
