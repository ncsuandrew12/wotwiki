## Entry #1

#### scm288

So, I don't actually own a hardcover copy of
*The Way of Kings*
, but I did notice when looking at one that there's a map of Shadesmar... And that the map shows that Shadesmar geography is precisely aligned with Roshar's geography... So I'm just going to assume that other planets we've visited so far also have realms of Shadesmar that are aligned geographically.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's very clever of you! (smiles) Very clever...

## Entry #2

#### scm288

So I guess my follow-up question is: is Elantris a Dawncity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmm. I could see where your reasoning could come to that conclusion, but no. No, that's not it. But your earlier extrapolations are in the right direction.
