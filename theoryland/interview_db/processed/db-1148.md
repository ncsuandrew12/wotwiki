## Entry #1

#### Kayla

Is the use of the color red before/during bad events a deliberate pattern?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. ((this is made worse because every personalized book I saw had “hands all red….” written in them. I AM AFRAID.))

## Entry #2

#### Kayla

Is it possible to use a Steelpush while wearing Shardplate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

After some confusion re: not Pushing on the Plate, but something else: yes. And we… think the mass of the plate would be what determined the force needed, not its (much lighter) effective weight to the bearer.

## Entry #4

#### Kogi

Anything you can tell us about santhids?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re one of a few Rosharan animals with a degree of sentience. It’s easier on Roshar for this to happen.

#### Kayla

Because of Cultivation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Footnote

Also, Santhids aren’t based on anything in particular on Earth (sad marine biologist face)

## Entry #5

#### Granvil4

I asked if Sazed is the only one to hold more than one Shard.

#### Brandon Sanderson

“Sazed is the only one to currently hold two Shards.” After a few seconds, he added, “I’m not going to say he is the only one to ever hold two.” That’s all he said about it though.
