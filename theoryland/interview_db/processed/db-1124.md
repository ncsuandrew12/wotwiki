## Entry #1

#### Leinton

Of all the published shardworlds, which one is your favorite to write and which would you want to live on.

#### Brandon Sanderson

One he wants to live on would definitely be Scadrial, because they have running water and electricity. Favorite to write is Roshar. He would not want to live on any of them though because they don't have internet or delivery pizza. (He later stated that delivery pizza would likely be a thing Scadrial would get, but that it would not be delivered via coinshots becaues they were too expensive).

## Entry #4

#### Leinton

Were the Edgedancers sort of like social workers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He laughed at this question, and said that was sort of accurate, but they were more like good samaritans than social workers.

## Entry #5

#### Leinton

Did Rashek use the Well or a bead of lerasium to become a Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He didn't know at first, I told him there were interviews with him saying both, and he eventually answered with "I'm canonizing it as he used the Well".

## Entry #6

#### Leinton

Is a Shard's influence of power based on physical distance, cognitive distance, something else, or does it vary from Shard to Shard?

It varies, but is definitely more physical.

## Entry #8

#### Leinton

So for Kaladin’s depression and Stormlight’s healing abilities, does Kaladin remain depressed because of his view of himself, or is it a limitation of Stormlight’s abilities to heal, or something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Disorders like depression are a part of a person's personality, and thus aren't diseases and cannot be cured. He talked a lot about this, and he talked about how a hyper kid annoys people but that doesn't mean there's something wrong.

## Entry #9

#### Leinton

Can you use hemalurgy to power machinery?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was initially confused as to what I meant, so I said I got the idea from thinking about FTL travel, and he said that it was a RAFO, but that I was thinking along the right lines, there needs to be a merger between magic and technology.
