## Entry #1

#### Zaela Sedai

Here is the unofficial report from the signing. AKA what I could make of my notes. We will have an official report later with the video and such. I was taking pictures, so I wrote as much as I could when I could. We had a great time; there were a ton of people there (about 200) we only had about 45 minutes of alone time with Brandon, so I had to share. But hopefully you guys enjoy some of the info I got!

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*The Gathering Storm*
Brandon did tell us that Rand was mostly his voice and Egwene was RJ. In
*Towers of Midnight*
Mat was RJ and Perrin was more BS. I'm not quite sure what he meant by voice, considering he doesn't usually answer questions like this.

## Entry #3

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Encyclopedia—Harriet is working on this project and it will be out probably about a year after
*A Memory of Light*
. Harriet said she plans it to be "like the 11th edition of Encyclopedia Britannica."

## Entry #4

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is still a chance that the prequels/outriggers would be done; Brandon wants to do them IF Harriet decides to have them written. Brandon would rather the prequels over the outriggers but TOR would rather the outriggers it seems as of right now, if only one is chosen (which probably would not be the case)

## Entry #5

#### Question

Much has been made of Egwene’s thought to tie up Perrin in the midst of a battle that could have brought about his death if he had not been able to stop her. Such apparent negligence is shocking considering her knowledge of how quickly things can happen in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Can you explain Egwene’s thought process? Did she intend to leave Perrin there while she finished the battle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(not verbatim) Egwene thought she was doing the right thing. She was acting as the Amyrlin and trying to make sure that he would be safe and out of the way of danger. She was not going to tie him up and leave him, she would have brought him somewhere safe away from the danger of the fight and left him there until it was over.

#### ZAELA SEDAI

Who is stronger in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

(not verbatim) They are both very strong, but in different ways. Perrin is very strong instinctively. Like the wolves, he makes decisions based on instinct while in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Egwene plans out her moves rather than going by feeling as Perrin does. If the two were matched against each other the outcome would entirely be based on what type of encounter it was.

## Entry #6

#### Question

When the wolves were on Dragonmount, who were they there to “lend strength to”—Rand or Perrin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They were there for Rand. They were doing what they thought would help Rand. Keep in mind that they are wolves and are not thinking as men would when it comes to the idea of helping others.

## Entry #12

#### Question

Why did Verin trust that Mat would open the letter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verin was bound to the Dark Oaths and she could not tell ANY of them to open the letters right away because she was not in her last hour. She had thought that out of anyone Mat would NOT listen to her and would open the letter right away. She was not able to give him any indication of what was in the letter or even tell him to open it open it right away.

## Entry #13

#### Question

Have we met the “ugly man”? (I assume Gaidal; this was a question I heard during the signing.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes we have.

#### Footnote

Fans have determined that this is actually impossible, since none of the babies seen on screen qualify (based on RJ's very strict guidelines).

## Entry #14

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon is trying to convince Harriet to let him do Annotations of the WoT books he co-wrote when the series is over. If he is allowed to do so it will come out in book form.

## Entry #15

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet was asked about religion in the series. Her response was that they are far more aware of the Light and Dark because it is what is around them, more so than it is for us. The Children of the Light are the closest thing to organized religion and it shows you what Robert Jordan feelings were towards organized religion.

## Entry #16

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet was also asked about movies/TV and said that Universal bought the rights for seven years, and two have gone by; she said “There is a twitch of life, like a frog twitching in your science lab.” The most recent information is that they have recently assigned two writers to the project.

## Entry #17

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon was asked what moment most shocked him in the notes. He said that Verin showing up in Egwene’s room was definitely what shocked him the most.
