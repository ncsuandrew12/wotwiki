## Entry #1

#### Aegon

Powell's Bookstore, Beaverton Oregon.

The crowd shot only shows the first 50%. Many more rows of seats continued back and it was standing room only.

I hope these photos show up and persist. I had a good time and was glad to have the opportunity to go.

## Entry #2

#### Aegon

I don't have a report. I brought my 3 year old and was focused on keeping her happy, so I didn't take notes. Off the top of my head, two days later, I remember some things:

#### Brandon Sanderson

The publisher for the Alcatraz series wasn't taking the books in the direction BS wanted, so he recently bought-back the rights to the series and plans to continue writing according to his own plan.

## Entry #3

#### Aegon

\*vague spoiler warning\*

An audience member had,
[years ago](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=180#6)
, asked RJ what would happen if an Aes Sedai balefired herself through a gateway, and was told by RJ that she should find a man, a woman, or a dog to love and she should get a life. (heavily paraphrased). The same audience member was present at the signing and asked if the scenario played out in
*A Memory of Light*
was done in response to her question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

BS said that he has avoided gateways and balefire in his series because that type of magic belonged to The Wheel of Time, but he himself has had many thoughts on the use of balefire and gateways. So no, the scenes from
*A Memory of Light*
were not a response to her, but BS's own story. The audience member also added that she did find a guy to love, had a daughter, named her Aviendha, and the crowd clapped.

## Entry #4

#### Aegon

I don't remember the other questions, maybe if I had something to jog my memory.

## Entry #5

#### [AegonÂ ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-memory-of-light-tour-report-open-thread#322732)

I remembered some more stuff in the shower this morning.

Someone asked who killed Asmodean. Groan. The answer was, of course, in the appendix [glossary] of
*Towers of Midnight*
.

In the interim since showering, I forgot the other thing I remembered. But it was of similar consequence as the Asmodean question. If I knew that I'd be sharing answers then I surely would have taken notes.

## Entry #6

#### Aegon

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I feel like somebody asked who summoned Slayer to the Blight. I could be mixing memories with
[Freelancer's great post @7](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-memory-of-light-tour-report-open-thread#321133)
, but I have a strange feeling that someone asked, and presented a case that it was Lanfear for similar reasons as provided above, and was told by BS that they make a good case and can defend their reasoning with confidence. I honestly don't know if I'm conflating memories, so please take this with a grain of salt.

#### Aegon

Furthermore, the above question doesn't make sense given that the audience was instructed not to spoil
*A Memory of Light*
, and to save questions related to
*A Memory of Light*
for the personal signings, which I wasn't able to attend or eavesdrop.
