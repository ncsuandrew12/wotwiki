Terez: the win and survive counted as ONE question, very direct answer there. :)

## Entry #5

#### [littleleicesterfoxÂ (22 November)](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=170009#poststop)

## Entry #6

#### LordJuss

*Tel'aran'rhiod*
) was so effective?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This got Brandon thinking hard but he RAFO'd it in the end but he did say 'are you a Theorylander?' which did make us laugh. :)
