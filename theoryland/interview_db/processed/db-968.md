## Entry #1

#### E. Hyde

I went to the Birmingham signing last night and had a good time there. I only ended up asking one Cosmere-related question, but hopefully it will still be useful.

## Entry #2

#### E. Hyde

I asked if assassination is common among the Parshendi, since they have a tradition of what assassins are supposed to wear.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said (and I'm paraphrasing) that the Parshendi are a lot more unified than they used to be, and back when they existed as a lot of separate tribes (he didn't say how long ago this was), raids and assassinations were a fairly regular thing.

#### E. Hyde

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Someone else asked if Adonalsium had been self-aware, and Brandon said he couldn't answer that yet.

## Entry #4

#### E. Hyde

I went to the event in a Wheel of Time costume (I posted a couple of pictures in the gallery) and met up with some people I knew from Dragon\*Con. I already owned all the books I was getting signed, but I did buy a couple of other books while I was there, including Dan Wells'
*Fragments*
(which isn't supposed to be published for a few more days ... exciting!) ;-)
