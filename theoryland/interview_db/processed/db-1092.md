## Entry #2

#### ProfessionalLurker

Any news on Alcatraz 5?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

He said he wrote the book last summer, and is waiting for the greenlight from Tor to hand it off, basically. They want to publish books 1-4 first, followed by this one. But the only thing needed is a schedule and edits! Still sounds like an early/mid 2016 thing to me.
