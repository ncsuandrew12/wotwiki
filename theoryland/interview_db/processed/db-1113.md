## Entry #2

#### Sabrina Stormshard

Could an awakened sentient object (e.g Nightblood ) bond a spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Technically but the specific circumstances you would need are so bizarre, in practice no.

## Entry #3

#### Wyrmhero

Can you could Hemalurgically Spike a dead thing, similar to how Breath goes into dead things? Could you spike a Lifeless?
(I regret not asking if Allomantic Lifeless could be a thing)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, if there was enough of the soul left for the Spike to take.

## Entry #5

World Hopping Hint in Elantris: Raoden has misinterpreted one of the Aons.

## Entry #6

#### Question

Could an Elantrian wield Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's possible but would be very dangerous - you'd have to figure out a way to connect Nightblood with a local source of Investiture.

## Entry #7

#### Question

On Shallan's origins as a character:

#### Brandon Sanderson

mostly derived from a character in Dragonsteel (I'm guessing the woman who turns up at the end of the "Liar of Partinel" book fragment that's been posted on his website) and Mat Cauthon. Specifically mentioned that she has issues with authority figures.

On origins of Dalinar

#### Brandon Sanderson

From story he wrote as teenager - his brother is the king who gets assassinated and he has to decide whether to take over from his nephew or not. Hoid is the court magician
