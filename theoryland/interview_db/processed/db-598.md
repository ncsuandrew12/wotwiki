## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

Back in January I posted about
[nominating and voting for the Hugo Awards](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/960/For-Your-Nomination-Consideration+Worldcon-Deadline)
. Well, if you're eligible to nominate (you needed to be a registered Worldcon member by the end of January, or have been a member of last year's Worldcon), the nomination deadline is tomorrow night. If you didn't register quickly enough to nominate, now is a good time to
[register](http://www.renovationsf.org/memberships.php)
so that you'll be eligible to vote on the final ballot, which should open fairly soon. The convention itself will be in Reno, Nevada from August 17th through 21st.

If you want more details, read my
[earlier post](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/960/For-Your-Nomination-Consideration+Worldcon-Deadline)
. For now, here's a reminder of what I've been involved in that's eligible for a nomination.

ELIGIBLE IN CATEGORY: BEST RELATED WORK

> Writing Excuses Season Four

ELIGIBLE IN CATEGORY: BEST NOVEL

> *Towers of Midnight*
>   
> *The Way of Kings*
>   
> *Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens*

OTHER CATEGORIES
  
I have a vested interest in a few other possible nominations. My editors Moshe Feder and Harriet McDougal are both eligible in the Best Editor (Long Form) category. Cover artists Michael Whelan, Darrell K. Sweet, and Todd Lockwood are eligible in the Best Professional Artist category. Howard Tayler's
*Schlock Mercenary*
book
[*Massively Parallel*](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2009-03-02)
is eligible in the Best Graphic Story category.
[Dan Wells'](http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/?p=894)
books
*I Am Not a Serial Killer*
and
*Mr. Monster*
are eligible in the Best Novel category, and Dan himself is eligible for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer (not a Hugo, but nominated on the same ballot).

If you're eligible to nominate and haven't done it yet, consider doing it now. And if you've already nominated and happen to want to revise your nominations, you can submit a new ballot that will cancel out the old one, which is rather convenient.
