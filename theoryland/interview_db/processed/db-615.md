## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had a great time at Polaris in Toronto this past weekend. If you couldn't be there, you can check out an mp3 of the Q&A session that I did, which
[@Thesleepingwolf](http://twitter.com/Thesleepingwolf)
has posted online
[here](http://kiwi6.com/file/738gedlzct)
. (If you want to download it and can't figure out which link to use, it's the one that says "Download File 9.43 MB." Or you can just listen to it on that page.) If you haven't heard me tell the story of how Harriet first got in touch with me, this is a good medium. It also covers several other topics including
*Mistborn*
,
*The Way of Kings*
, etc.

I'll be flying out to San Diego in a couple of hours for Comic-Con. I posted
[my schedule](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/998/)
in the last blog entry (I'll basically just be there on Thursday).

## Entry #2

If you didn't know,
[InkWing](http://store.inkwing.com/)
is run by
*Mistborn*
/
*Way of Kings*
interior artist Isaac Stewart, and they do the official T-shirts for my books. They have a contest every month or so that usually involves giving away free shirts, and this month they also have a coupon code.
[Check out their post here](http://inkwing.blogspot.com/2011/07/coupon-contest.html)
.

There are also official Wheel of Time T-shirts at Ta'veren Tees, and they have a teaser trailer for a new shirt that will be available this month.

## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

Last week's Writing Excuses podcast episode covered
[Cyberpunk](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/07/10/)
. So this week Dan, Mary, Howard, and I do one of our
[brainstorming episodes](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/07/17/)
, in that genre.

This week's
[*Warbreaker*
annotation](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/437/Warbreaker-Chapter-Fifty-Seven)
covers the biggest climax chapter. It's chock-full of spoilers, of course.
