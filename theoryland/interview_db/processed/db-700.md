## Entry #3

#### Thorondir

Who names the planets? You've said once that "Scadrial" was the name of the planet as Ruin and Preservation knew it, but where'd they get that name? Do the Shardholders all get together and vote on it or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said thay already had their names and that the all the planets existed before the shardholders got there.

## Entry #4

#### Thorondir

How many Shardworlds are there? Only seven? (Sel, Nalthis, Scadrial, Roshar, Yolen, Taldain, and whatever planet The Silence Divine is on?)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he has a set number in his head but that he didn’t want to say it because he might change his mind. Essentially he doesn’t want to make the number of world’s canon yet.

Why do Shards refer to themselves by their Shard name, rather than their original name? Do they still remember their original name?
