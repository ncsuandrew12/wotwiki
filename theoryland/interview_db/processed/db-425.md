## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

The folks over at
[Garden Ninja studio](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/799/www.gardenninja.com)
wrote to let me know that a BSCreview.com is doing a contest where they're giving away some minis. This week,
[it's a contest for a set of Goblin Quest minis](http://www.bscreview.com/2009/06/contest-garden-ninja-studios-miniatures-part-1-patina-finished-goblin-quest-miniatures/)
(from the book series.) They'll have Mistborn minis for give away next week, but I thought you might want to head over this week to get in on the Goblin Quest ones as well.

Also, a kindly reader sent me
[some fanart of Vin](http://robbiek1000.com/Vin_Images.html)
. Thought you guys might like to see it.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you're following along at home,
*The Gathering Storm*
is now in the proofread stage. I got an email letting me know that the manuscript will be coming back after the proofreads in July, and we'll need to have it back by the end of July. Then it's on to production officially. Things are getting close now.

I just need to remember to get new photos taken for the jacket. The ones on my books are now six or seven years old . . .
