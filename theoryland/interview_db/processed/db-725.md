## Entry #1

#### Loialson

Okay, here's the Q&A from Brandon's signing I went to a couple hours ago. I edited out most ums and vocal stumbles and what not, but this is nearly a word-for-word transcription of the
[recording](http://www.mediafire.com/?453cb0s5qn24may)
I made.

It's quite long, so Wall Of Text Warning!

Question from guy in front of me (named Sean):

## Entry #2

#### Sean

I had a question—feel free to RAFO this if you need to—but, will we find out what the Book of Translation is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Send me an email.

#### Sean

I can PM you on Reddit.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, PM me on Reddit.... That's like, something I think that's more appropriate for the Encyclopedia, personally; but I'll see if I can make that work.

#### Footnote

PMing Brandon on any site (Facebook, etc.) is usually not a good way to try to get in touch with him.

## Entry #3

#### Loialson

Hey Brandon, I got a bunch of questions from the Wheel of Time Re-read.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay! Alright! So Wetlander and people.

#### LOIALSON

Yes...Are the impressive displays of power that Rand makes in
*Towers of Midnight*
(i.e., stopping the Trolloc army and having no concern over being able to leave the White Tower) a result of his integrated knowledge or his
*ta'veren*
nature?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Umm...Both, though, one thing you have to keep in mind, is...Rand, as a result of power level...Robert Jordan was specifically not using him very often because his power had grown so powerful even by the end of
*Knife of Dreams*
. I mean, you look at
*Knife of Dreams*
—if you go reread the fight in
*Knife of Dreams*
he is laying waste to nearly as many Trollocs as he has when he does the battle at the temple—which is not actually called that in the books—that's the one with the Trollocs and things [referencing Rand's big single-handed fight in
*Towers of Midnight*
]. And so...yes, some of these things have changed, but he's really powerful now.

Now, the thing about in the White
*Tower*
is something different. [Brandon smiles]

#### Footnote

Someone needs to ask Brandon about that 'temple' thing.

## Entry #4

#### Loialson

Is the glow in Rand's head that Nynaeve sees upon delving Rand linked to the nature of him being
*ta'veren*
, or because of the nature of him being the Dragon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(laughs) I'm gonna RAFO that one.

## Entry #5

#### Loialson

In
*Towers of Midnight*
it was mentioned that Mesaana had traded Graendal an
*angreal*
in exchange for information. Did Mesaana put that information to use yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that she...she did what she could with it. It wasn't as useful to her as she had hoped it would be. I mean, I wanna give you more, because Mesaana's basically out of the picture at this point....

#### Loialson

Did Nynaeve inform Egwene that according to Rand, the Dark One can resurrect the soul of a Forsaken killed by any means other than balefire?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I honestly don't know if she's told her yet.

## Entry #7

#### Loialson

Can Rand still access the True Power through Moridin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a Read and Find Out. A big one.

#### Footnote

Brandon
[has said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#155)
that Rand can still sense it, but he is resisting using it. So the 'big' RAFO was for the idea that Rand channels the True Power
[via Moridin](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#14)
.

That is a big RAFO.

## Entry #9

#### Loialson

Was Verin was correct when she said that the Portal Stones predate the Age of Legends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know...she is correct. That's one of the ones I could be wrong on, but as far as I know she's correct.

## Entry #10

#### Loialson

Aviendha told Rand in
*Lord of Chaos*
that
*ji'e'toh*
was who the Aiel were, at their core. Do the Aiel need to find some other purpose/faith besides
*ji'e'toh*
to avoid the calamitous future that Aviendha saw in the Way-forward
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that...a half yes. They don't need to abandon
*ji'e'toh*
or find a new
*ji'e'toh*
but they may have to adapt
*ji'e'toh*
to certain other things....

## Entry #11

#### Loialson

In
*Lord of Chaos*
, Nynaeve and Elayne searched for something that would tie the Salidar Aes Sedai to Rand via Need in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
.

Need led them to three things. First it led them to the White Tower, (where Elayne glimpsed Egwene briefly), then Need shifted Nynaeve and Elayne to a locked storeroom within the White Tower (they thought that was useless). After that, Need led them to the Bowl of the Winds. My questions are regarding the first two things Need brought them to.

On the first thing, was Need bringing them to Egwene?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe it was Egwene.

#### LOIALSON

On the second thing, what was the item Need brought them to in that storeroom?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

RAFO.

#### LOIALSON

Was that something besides the Horn of Valere?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It could be.

#### LOIALSON

[I felt that this question was grasping at straws here a bit from the impression I got from him, i.e. it's not that important regarding what the item is, but that it will come into play. And it's not the Horn of Valere in this case. I could be wrong, that's just the vibe I got.]

## Entry #12

#### Loialson

Is the Dark One's touch still on Fain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Umm...yes, you don't abandon it that easily, but, the other touch on Fain is far more dominant.

#### LOIALSON

That would be Mordeth?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes.

#### LOIALSON

Is Fain still a Darkfriend?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I don't know if Fain counts as a Darkfriend anymore. I think Fain is his own faction.

#### LOIALSON

How is Fain getting Trollocs and Myrddraal to follow him if he is not a Darkfriend?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He is using...other means...they aren't following him because he is a Darkfriend. Certainly not [he smiles a bit here].

#### LOIALSON

Is Mat still attached in any way to Fain's dagger?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Read and Find out.

## Entry #13

#### Loialson

On Elaida—Did RJ leave notes about the rapid downward spiral that is Elaida's personality? First she seems like a mean but competent Aes Sedai, then it all goes sideways with a taste of power happens and Elaida becomes an egomaniac. Did RJ and Brandon do this to give Seanchan knowledge of Traveling? Only a nutbar would do something with such huge ramifications to betray her sisters.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He left specific notes regarding Elaida and her downfall.

## Entry #14

#### Loialson

Can Rand consciously control his
*ta'veren*
pull to any degree? Specifically referencing to his meeting with Tuon to will her to submit to him, and when he threatened Cadsuane to will her dead.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He, um, believes that he can.

#### LOIALSON

Still, even after the
*The Gathering Storm*
reintegration?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He has a more zen view on it now, but he still believes that he can have some influence.

## Entry #15

#### Loialson

Was the stone Aviendha slept near during
*Towers of Midnight*
a portal stone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Nice try! That's eliminating one theory, I'll give you that one.

#### LOIALSON

Was Aviendha in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
or in a mirror/portal world when she met Nakomi?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

RAFO.

#### LOIALSON

Is Nakomi Jenn Aiel?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

[laughs and grins] I should RAFO that shouldn't I?

#### LOIALSON

I'd appreciate it if you didn't.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

[laughs] I want Nakomi....We're gonna RAFO that for now. Nakomi needs...there's gotta be a few things I don't answer. I'm so bad, I answer everything Robert Jordan put an answer [for, to?] [bunch of people laugh]. Track me down another time, after
*A Memory of Light*
is out.
