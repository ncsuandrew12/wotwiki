## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Brandon had flight problems, and he showed up at about 8:30. He wouldn't answer anything that might spoil
*Towers of Midnight*
, but while signing my copy, I did ask him if Rand has met with Sorilea since his time on Drangonmount, and he said he thinks that Rand has. Sorry about not having much to give you.
