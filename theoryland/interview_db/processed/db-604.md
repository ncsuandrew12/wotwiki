## Entry #1

#### Terez

Edit: my transcript of the Sunday signing questions, including WSB's:

## Entry #2

#### Ted Herman

When the Eelfinn told Mat, 'Wise to ask for leavetaking, when you set no price' etc., did they know he would be back?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The 'Finns do not have a perfect vision of the future, but are capable of reading some things about it, and so I would say it's likely they knew. They didn't know everything, though.

#### Ted Herman

So, it's...to the best of their knowledge, they couldn't...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. They sincerely tried to kill him, but they knew there was a strong possibility he'd be back.

#### Ted Herman

Did they know that his
*ashandarei*
was the answer to the leavetaking thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They knew what they were giving him. They were hoping he wouldn't.

#### Ted Herman

Excellent. Thank you.

## Entry #3

#### Scott

In
*Towers of Midnight*
, when Rand confronts Lord Weiramon and Lady Anaiyella, and they basically can't look at him...I was wondering, does he have like an aura of Lightness that's preventing them from looking at him, or was it possibly that Verin clued him in to the fact that they were Darkfriends in her letter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More will be revealed...

#### Scott

We'll get some more info on that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll get some more info on things that were happening in
*Towers of Midnight*
once you see from Rand's perspective in the next book.

#### Scott

Great! That's great to hear...I can't wait for it. Thank you.

## Entry #4

#### blindillusion

Did Aginor have anything to do with creating the Nym?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not that I know of. I can MAFO that, but I'm like 95% sure on that.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The Green Man? No...he was good!

#### Terez

You know, that's what I said to him last night, and then he was like, 'Well, you know, before the Bore was drilled, you know...that might have been what he was doing.' Because, you know, he had to get his experience in bioengineering somewhere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah...

#### blindillusion

Yeah, where did he get his start?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a good question, but I don't think so. I really don't. But, if you really want me to go to the notes and search it out, I will.

#### blindillusion

That works for me. Thank you very much.

#### Maria Simons

A quick search turned up nothing, I'm afraid. I'll try to remember to keep my eyes open for it.

## Entry #5

#### Marie Curie

Even a stone in a wall has a thread in the Pattern, right? You said so...

#### Brandon Sanderson

As I understand it, Robert Jordan specifically said that even inanimate objects have a thread.

#### Marie Curie

So, that explains why when, say, a stone pillar is balefired, only the portion that balefire hits disintegrates...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right...

#### Marie Curie

...because all of those little bits would have their own threads...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Theoretically. And I was wrong on that for a while—I had to go back and look at interviews before I...[to Terez] Were you the one that sent me that?

#### Terez

Yeah, I
[tweeted](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#77)
that to you...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah...the boat that Nynaeve was on that got balefired...

#### Marie Curie

She pointed out that inanimate objects...their threads are burned back. But that also explains why a person who has one thread tied to their soul would be completely eliminated by balefire.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmmhmm.

#### Marie Curie

So...why did their clothes go away?

#### Terez

(laughs)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Balefire does spread a bit, from what I've read.

#### Marie Curie

Then why doesn't it for the column?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does, but it's like, you know...just a little bit.

#### Marie Curie

Right, but if you use a pencil-thin bit of balefire, right, and I shot your shirt, why would the whole shirt disappear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, if it goes through and hits you, then you disintegrate, and it will spread out from you.

#### Marie Curie

Then, that doesn't explain Nynaeve's boat.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it doesn't. ... I will be perfectly honest with you. I've worked through and tried to figure out the rules of balefiring inanimate objects quite a bit...because we've got the whole thing with Nynaeve and...

#### Marie Curie

The rowers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Well no, not even that...earlier than that with the balefire rod that's like cutting swaths through the palace in Tanchico, and it's just cutting lines through the palace, just slicing big holes...

#### Marie Curie

Right. That's the stone pillars...the multiple threads...

#### Terez

It did the same thing in Caemlyn with Rand and Rahvin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And that's searing little lines, but then you hit something living, and it all \*poofs\*. It actually becomes motes...like it hits and it spreads to the full, living thing, and then \*poof\* that all goes away. And so...the clothes are something I hadn't even thought of, but balefire does seem to spread a little bit...

#### Marie Curie

You would think that, you know...where the balefire hit, obviously there would be a hole, the person would \*poof\*, and their clothes would drop.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. But it's got to spread a little bit because of that. But then, you know, with the boat...yeah.

#### Marie Curie

You can't imagine how many debates we've had on Theoryland about the boat...

#### Terez

Oh god...

#### Brandon Sanderson

The boat is an outlier. You could argue a couple of things on it—distance and power level could both be involved.

#### Marie Curie

And there are other outliers, like in
*The Gathering Storm*
...um...

#### Terez

The palace?

#### Marie Curie

Yeah, the palace...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That, I did intentionally. Looking through everything that is happening, and saying, 'He is continuing to pump balefire into this thing, to expand it through into the entire thing...'

#### Terez

So, it's a deliberate, directive thing...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's got to be possible, because in the Age of Legends...

#### Terez

Right, whole cities...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, whole cities. And so there's got to be a force-to-spread multiplier. Does that make sense?

#### Marie Curie

Sure.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, I'm using a force-to-spread multiplier. And so you could maybe make that argument with the boat.

## Entry #6

#### Terez

[Brandon is signing my copy of
*Towers of Midnight*
and drawing a lovely

.]

You even put the yeard in! That's awesome.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I didn't put the yeard in...

#### Terez

Yeah you did!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I put the yeard in, but I didn't call him 'yeard', though...I called him 'Zod', which is my nickname for him, because he reminds me of General Zod in all his publicity photos, so there you are.

#### Terez

[He moves on to signing
[my copy](http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i111/Terez27/HeroofAges.png)
of
*Hero of Ages*
, and a dude behind me joins the conversation.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

You voted for Quick Ben, didn't you?

#### Terez

In the last round.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, uh-huh.

#### Terez

Up until the semi-finals, I supported Vin, but in the finals I supported Quick Ben.

#### Dude

I never even heard of that series until the, uh...

#### Terez

Well that's what cage match is for!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And it's actually a shame; he should be better known than he is. He's a really great writer.

#### Terez

It's the learning curve.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's the learning curve mixed with some really bad publication luck. What was going on with him is, he published first in the UK, and got a really good big following, and then he did a big launch in America with TOR, but by then, all the Americans had heard about him from the UK and were buying the UK editions, and TOR was behind, and so every time they would publish a UK edition, all his fans went and bought the UK edition, and then TOR would release several months later, and it wouldn't sell...

#### Terez

Because we wanted our books to match!

#### Brandon Sanderson

...and so he had real trouble getting shelf presence in America for that reason.

#### Dude

Yeah, that makes sense.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And it is a shame; he's a really good author. But I think he's catching up finally. TOR is simultaneously releasing now, which will really help.

#### Dude

I definitely want to start picking up new series once the Wheel of Time is done. I've invested in too many large series that are ongoing...

#### Terez

And this one is finished!

#### Brandon Sanderson

This one is finished. He's going to do more in the world, but the series is done, so you can read it full sequence. It's very nice.

#### Dude

Thank you.
