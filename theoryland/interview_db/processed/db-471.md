## Entry #1

#### Matoyak

Ok, so I got to the Borders late (damn dumb Arlington traffic took forever) so I missed the initial speech Brandon gave. He refused to answer anything relating to
*The Gathering Storm*
or anything that might touch upon it or stuff after
*The Gathering Storm*
in this portion, though, so I didn't miss much. Anyways, when my time to get my book signed came up, I got three questions off. I then hung around and listened in to see what other questions I could hear. I finally got to ask two more of my own. Here's what I got out of this signing: (These are mostly based off of my memories, I didn't have a tape recorder or anything, but these are accurate.)

## Entry #2

#### Matoyak

OK, just a heads up, I'm from Theoryland so you know I've got a few questions I'm going to have to ask you...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh boy...I'm going to have to think about these, aren't I?

## Entry #3

#### Matoyak

Heroes of the Horn, are they corrective mechanisms by themselves, or are they corrective mechanisms by virtue of being
*ta'veren*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Heroes are not always
*ta'veren*
. So, yes, they are corrective mechanisms by themselves.

## Entry #4

#### Matoyak

Have the visions and other such prophecies about Egwene and the Seanchan (such as the running one and the one with the sword) have they been fulfilled yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, none of those have been fulfilled other than the attack on the White Tower. She still has more to go.

## Entry #5

#### Question

There have been rumors that you have said that Mr. Jordan did not have anything in his notes about the voice of Lews Therin, whether it was a construct or not. That or that you had sai—[cut off]

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would like to clarify this, thanks for asking. I will NOT say that it was not in the notes. However, Mr. Jordan did NOT want to reveal this information, and therefore I shall not ever either. Mr. Jordan did not want to reveal it.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

## Entry #6

#### Matoyak

Oh, ok, well that's all for now. Thanks a lot!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, I was able to answer all three of those questions. Really well thought out, congratulations! I didn't have to RAFO you! You get a silver star.

#### Matoyak

Haha, I'll let the guys at Theoryland know that, after all, they're mostly their questions.

## Entry #7

#### Roga

Does Elayne know that Alanna bonded Rand?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh...well...I'll have to check that. MAFO. Good question.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/46013-mafo-answers/)

From
*Winter’s Heart*
, chapter 12, Rand speaking to Elayne, Aviendha, and Min: “Anyway, Alanna Mosvani got there ahead of you, and she didn’t bother asking . . . I’ve been bonded to her for months now.”

#### Footnote—Terez

I asked around about this because I believed that Mato had misheard the name, and that the question was actually about whether Egwene knew about the bonding. (Many people pronounce it egg-WEEN instead of the proper egg-WAIN, so it's easy for those people to hear 'Elayne' when 'Egwene' is pronounced correctly.) The question was asked by Roga, a Stormleader, and he clarified:

#### [Roga](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/46013-mafo-answers/page__view__findpost__p__1405563)

If this question came from the Dallas signing, then it was from me. I asked about Egwene.

The reason behind the question was, I wanted to know: if Alanna's name had been on Verin's list in
*The Gathering Storm*
, would Egwene have passed over it? However, Brandon pointed out that Verin knew about the bond, so unless she had some reason to keep quiet, I'd think she should've made some kind of special warning note if Alanna had been in her list.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/answers-to-a-few-mafo-questions-r658)

Egwene did not know.

## Entry #8

#### Random Crazy Lady

Is there any chance that Cadsuane might be Ilyena reborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I...wha?...First of all, I'm not going to answer that. Second of all...EWW! ... And you can quote me on that!

#### Matoyak

[note from Mato: This was frackin' HILARIOUS. Totally unexpected, and Sanderson was totally shocked over it.]

## Entry #9

#### Matoyak

Did the meeting between Rand and Moridin for sure happen in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
or could it have happened in a vacuole?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I...well. I'm going to partially RAFO this. I will not say it for sure happened in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, and I'm not sure whether the other instances of this were
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
either.

#### Footnote

The referenced meeting between Rand and Moridin occurred in
*The Gathering Storm*
15, and Brandon later
[clarified](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#24)
that this meeting took place in Moridin's dream.

## Entry #10

#### Random Storm Leader

[note: this next one is heavily paraphrased. I was not able to hear a good amount of it]
  
Elaida's dress in the dinner where she beat Egwene, I noticed that you included uncut
stones in her dress.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah yes, I added that post-revision remembering your question you had asked me before. I felt it fit in with the technology, and was a good addition.

By the way, the Storm Leaders in this particular signing have been the best prepared so far. You all have done great!

#### Random Storm Leader

Oh, thank you! We did try.

## Entry #11

#### Matoyak

Can you elaborate on why the voice of Lews Therin was not speaking when Rand and Isha—I mean Moridin were talking? Is it becau—

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah. Yes, well, I'm going to have to RAFO that one...too close to dealing with the specifics of the voice, sorry.

## Entry #12

#### Random Storm Leader

[note from Mato: had some trouble hearing this next question, take its answer as just a generic "RAFO, not a typo. There were other typos. < insert example >"]

Was Sulin really with Rand or—?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. I will tell you when there are typos or not. This is a RAFO.
Some typos that have been found are Bashere appearing as Faile's cousin rather than uncle...my hands kept wanting to type cousin instead.

#### Random Storm Leader

Ah, what about the Amyrlin stole versus shawl?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Typo. My hands kept trying to switch stole and shawl throughout the book. Giving me trouble. You know how it is when you're going along and your hands want to type something different...

## Entry #13

#### Matoyak

Well there ya have it! Lots of good information here, the death of a faction war being among one of them. Also, I have official proof that Bela killed Asmodean.

For the personalization of my signing I put:

For Mason Matoyak \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ killed Asmodean.

Here's the pic of what he wrote: [Brandon filled in the blank with 'Bela'.]
