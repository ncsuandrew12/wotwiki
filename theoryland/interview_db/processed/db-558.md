## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

Confirmed Asmosdean's killer will be revealed in this book (but we knew that already). Someone asked if he would let them know what page and Brandon laughed and said he's not making it that easy.

## Entry #4

#### Question

One question I wrote down when somenoe asked was: "Will we see Demandred in the book?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*Big Smile\* "What do you mean? You saw Demandred all the time! He shows up all the time!"

#### Revised Question

"Will we find who Demandred's alter-ego is?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm gonna have to RAFO that one."
