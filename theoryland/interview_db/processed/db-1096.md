## Entry #1

#### mail-mi

Could you spike Elantrian-ness? Like, could you Hemalurgically spike Elantrian-ness?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Theoretically, yes.

#### mail-mi

Could you out of a Reod Elantrian? The zombie ones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes you could.

#### mail-mi

You could?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So what you would be spiking there is their connection to... to the planet, first. That's gonna be the big important thing. So you're going to overwrite your connection. Um, and then you're going to.... it's going to be a complicated process because you're going to have to spike the actual ability to have been transformed, that's gonna be harder.

#### mail-mi

Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Does that make sense?

#### mail-mi

Yeah, so it's gonna take two spikes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's gonna take two spikes.

#### mail-mi

Alright.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And you gonna have to get the right connection to the right place. Let's say you spike somebody from MaiPon, and then you spike an Elantrian, you're not going to be able to use it, you're not connected to the right area.

## Entry #2

#### mail-mi

So, could [Reod Elantrians] be felt by Lifesense?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They would, um... they are in the middle of a transformation. I would say that yes they could be, but you're going to get like a stutter is what I'd guess you would get, it's like you would get a... a flashing.

#### mail-mi

Because they're kind of alive, and kind of not alive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And so, yeah, you'd just get a flashing sort of.... something.

## Entry #3

#### mail-mi

Okay. What would a Shardblade do to [a Reod Elantrian]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, a Shardblade would... oh boy. A Shardblade... a Shardblade would still be dangerous to them. The trick is the Shardblade's gonna treat them half alive, half dead. So, it probably would be kind of a flicker, so it depends on when you hit them. It might cut the arm off.

#### mail-mi

It might cut the arm off...

#### Brandon Sanderson

And it might just leave it dead.

## Entry #5

#### mail-mi

How easy would it be to pull metal through [a Reod Elantrian]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Pull metal out of them.... Easi-
*er*
.

#### mail-mi

Easier than a regular human?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## Entry #6

#### mail-mi

Is Nightblood's sheath made out of aluminum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is an excellent question that nobody has asked me yet! Um...I will RAFO that.

## Entry #7

#### mail-mi

Does a more Investiture-poor world make it so its magics are easier to use off-world? Because, you said that Scadrial is really Investiture-poor, and it can be used easily off-world, but Roshar is very Investiture-rich, and how can you get Stormlight off of Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Um, I would say that there is a correlation.

#### mail-mi

There is a correlation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmhmm.

## Entry #8

#### mail-mi

Okay, cool. And then, just one more, shouldn't the rest of Roshar be more Earth-like, more Shinovar-like, kind of, with Cultivation on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are mistakenly assuming that Cultivation means Earth-like flora and fauna. Roshar is very bountiful and like it's not a barren land. Roshar is very....

#### zas678

Thriving?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's thriving. Yeah, it just has a different ecology. You're mistakenly assuming that our ecology is the only sort that can be bountiful.
