## Entry #2

#### [Zack Lex Crow (4 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/ZackLexCrow/status/287136982180691968)

I read once that there would be a Mat-Tuon series post–Last Battle. Is this true, @BrandSanderson?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/287154964629970945)

There was going to be, as RJ was planning to do one, but without him Harriet has no plans to continue on after
*A Memory of Light*
.

## Entry #3

#### [Anele (6 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/interneth3ro/status/288117355870048256)

Any info on when
*A Memory of Light*
will be available on iBooks?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288130814078758913)

It will be a few months, I'm afraid. Harriet's decision, not Tor's or mine.

#### [Kevin Williams](https://twitter.com/kevmatwill/status/288117066001702912)

Will
*A Memory of Light*
be on iBooks on the 8th?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288130970660532225)

No, I believe it is April. Harriet insisted. I tried to get it simultaneous. This was the compromise.

#### [Zach Burmeister (8 January)](https://twitter.com/ZBurmeister/status/288743908396126208)

Why such a delay for the ebook release?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288744566734069760)

Harriet is uncomfortable with ebooks. She wanted a year delay. We talked her into a few months.

#### [Zak Bryson](https://twitter.com/krispyfresh/status/288755083347365888)

Super annoyed that ebook versions of
*A Memory of Light*
don't come out until April 9th. Own all the other books in ebook form.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288756216300191744)

I wish it were our choice. Harriet insisted.

#### [Zoe M](https://twitter.com/Zoe_MM/status/288796677832331269)

Wow, anger about the ebook is brutalizing those Amazon ratings.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288797404298375168)

Always does. I wish they would realize Tor couldn't change this, nor could I.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288738906642448384)

*A Memory of Light*
is out today! Yay! On my way to the airport after a brief night's sleep. See some of you tonight in the Twin Cities.

#### [BJ Whitkin](https://twitter.com/Itsjustbeej/status/288801718223921152)

Really??? Then why isn't it on my Nook?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288801939729285120)

Harriet insisted it be delayed on ebook.

#### [BJ Whitkin](https://twitter.com/Itsjustbeej/status/288801946435997696)

Did anyone ask her why no ebook? Did she answer?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288802176707485696)

She is worried ebook sales would cause the hardcover to not sell enough to hit #1 on the bestseller lists.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288802260375441408)

I disagree, as does TOR, but it is her decision. Longer explanation on my blog tomorrow.

#### [Nick Timakondu](https://twitter.com/NickTimakondu/status/288820818522275840)

*A Memory of Light*
not available on Kindle until April? What a stupid decision.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288821230365204480)

I'm afraid my hands are tied. Harriet insisted.

#### [Lis Mitchell](https://twitter.com/Pixelfish/status/288955315788070913)

I have to say I didn't realize till this morning and was quite bummed. No more physical books get bought here.

#### [Rachel Reams](https://twitter.com/sunraven01/status/289078047481683969)

I also do not buy physical books any longer. Just found out no
*Memory of Light*
ebook and I'm disappointed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

See the
[end of my blog post](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#7)
today.

#### [Dylan Verheul](https://twitter.com/dyve/status/289057985144168448)

@torbooks Please release
*A Memory of Light*
in electronic format. cc @BrandSanderson

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289091340803923968)

See the
[end of my blog post](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#7)
today. Nothing I can do, I'm afraid.

#### [Dylan Verheul](https://twitter.com/dyve/status/289099692703354880)

Thanks for your openness. This says "rankings are more important than readers", but your explanation helps.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289109377321930753)

Well, Harriet doesn't
*get*
ebooks. She thinks they're like paperbacks. She figures if paperback readers will wait, why not ebook readers?

#### [tkm222 (13 January)](https://twitter.com/tkm222/status/290621630177234945)

Just read about reasons for no ebook... There are now illegal copies everywhere... I am waiting to buy but am very disappointed.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290639999865585664)

I am very sorry. Wish I could do more.

#### [E-R (14 January)](http://twitter.com/Opt1mus1980/status/290920681581973504)

Any idea when the Kindle or Nook edition of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290934114348056577)

April. (Explanation on my website. Terribly sorry about the delay.)

## Entry #4

#### [Brian Shanahan (6 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/dasanimal/status/288104826448011265)

Have you ever considered writing a prequel to the WoT? Something during the Trolloc Wars or earlier? It has potential.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288132039729872896)

I think it would be a bad idea—not that it would be a bad story, but that we shouldn't exploit RJ's legacy.

#### [Daniel (7 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/FC_Ag07/status/288165220243869696)

At 11:52 PM on 11/6/13, I finished reading The Wheel of Time. To Robert Jordan, you, and all of team Jordan...Thank you.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (7 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288187690413879297)

It has been an honor. The epilogue as it stands now is the sequence I read 5 years ago—the last part that RJ left for us.

#### Footnote

This was clarified
[elsewhere](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#9)
. RJ didn't write the entire epilogue, but it's implied he wrote most of it, and certainly the Rand POVs at the end (this was RJ's 'last scene').

Attending a
*Memory of Light*
book signing event? If so, make sure to ask @BrandSanderson for a unique signature. Make him think. #hcff

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288799520979054592)

Just for that, each time an HCFF asks me this, I'm going to write something about you dying violently.

#### [Matt Hatch](https://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/289248071316037632)

...@Southpaw2014 was first HCFF to ask @BrandSanderson for a unique signature:

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288818645054939136)

Harriet and Team Jordan have it well in hand, and will do a far better job than I could.

In your FAQ you
[mentioned](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#6)
no more WoT books. Does this decision negate any chance of movies/TV shows/mini series?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289133336729894912)

No it does not. (I am hoping for a prequel video game, myself.)

#### [Kristi Deming (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/tigana0118/status/290247884853633024)

Any chance of finding out what "Bao" or "The Wyld" mean since we have no glossary?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290306967061270528)

Both are a reference to Beowulf, and I meant the Wyld to mean "predator" or, in more common tongue, he who will kill the dragon.

#### Footnote

The name "Bao" also came from Bao Pham, a fan who has worked (along with Jimmy Liang, blademaster "Jaim" of The Yearly Brawl) teaching sword forms for JordanCon and the WoT track at DragonCon.

## Entry #11

#### [Can (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/yilmazturkc/status/290538549642665984)

@Terez27 Do we know which character is
[dead by Harriet's choice](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#17)
?

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/290539142599827456)

Bela. @BrandSanderson
[told us](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#39)
[twice](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#26)
that she would survive. :( But apparently Harriet later insisted she should die.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290549706852028416)

Yeah. Harriet felt that we had painted that character into a corner, and the story demanded that conclusion.

#### [Daniel Shepard](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/290555796650090498)

Is that the
[GRRM moment](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#27)
? Or the character that was gonna recover from their injuries?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290556875982917632)

Character was going to recover.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290549958736752641)

She was right to make that call, but it does turn me into a liar. That's what I get for speaking too soon...

#### [Werthead](https://twitter.com/Werthead/status/290567025439432704)

That does seem slightly ludicrous. I think the fanbase turned Bela into a bit of a meme.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290567504508633090)

True, but I will note that Harriet personally has a special fondness for her.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290567799355629568)

She has said that she would joke with RJ that Bela was the character based on Harriet in the books.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290576171962351617)

Harriet even has "Bela" in her email address. She took her fate quite seriously.

#### [Werthead](https://twitter.com/Werthead/status/290567175205421056)

The average reader wouldn't even remember who she was. Weird this much effort was spent on her.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290575493856641027)

You think? Back when I was an average reader and hadn't talked about the books online, I loved Bela.

Did RJ say that Nakomi should be included? You
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#4)
she was "deep in RJ's notes" but wondering if it was up in the air?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290563280030793728)

I said something deep in the notes made me include her. I have not said if she herself was in the notes or not.

*A Memory of Light*
, one of my all-time favorites. But for clarification, what, exactly, did Rand do to seal the Bore?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290564783231610880)

I want to avoid spoilers on my feed, if possible. But it involved access to something Lews Therin did not have.

Is Rand leaving his friends (mainly Perrin, Mat, Loial & Tam) never to be seen again in the end, or does he contact them later?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290566841334628353)

I believe RJ wanted people to wonder and decide for themselves. What do you think happened?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290639434683129858)

I will do a blog post soon about this and similar questions. However, I can't answer much because I don't know much.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290639629579853824)

He did not explain much about the epilogue, even in the notes.

#### [Terez (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/290602033315188736)

I once wrote a poem about writer's block. I was reminded of it when I the last scene of chapter 44... @BrandSanderson
<https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106123521532493824>

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290641091739414531)

I would love to see the poem. And it sure was nice to have Thom around to help with inspiration.

#### [Patrick](https://twitter.com/Kirtapthebard/status/290605412665946113)

Thom's chapter viewpoint in
*Memory of Light*
, hands down for me, was my favorite. Beautifully written.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290640641782865920)

Really really we wish we had more of what happened "after". I personally believe. I'm thinking it wasnt your decision though.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290557279755988993)

It was not, but I agree with how it is. Those sorts of endings—like in Harry Potter—don't work for me as well.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290557637202952192)

However, Harriet has promised to release what we know of RJ's planned sequel trilogy to give you more info.

Man, it feels good to be writing again. Revision (which I spent most of last year doing) is very important. But the writing is what I love.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/291257947584073730)

About a year ago I turned in the rough draft of
*A Memory of Light*
. It was VERY rough. Took eight months of hard work to get it into shape.

## Entry #22

#### Terez

This is the beginning of the post–
*A Memory of Light*
Twitter Q&A. It ends at entry #73. The non-WoT portion can be found on the non-WoT page, beginning with
[entry #15](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=897#15)
and ending with entry #24.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294159442604347392)

Today at 4:00 Eastern/2:00 Mountain I'll be doing the
[#torchat](http://torforge.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/january-torchat-lineup-revealed/)
here on Twitter.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294186510096429058)

@fionwe1987 (question about spoilers) @tordotcom That's a good question. Thoughts, Tor? Should I post a spoiler warning on all of this? Probably better to do so.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294187772443516928)

I'm starting #torchat. Tweet me your questions with that tag. SPOILERS ALLOWED. So don't watch if you haven't finished
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294187973547786241)

Warning, I don't have time to look up of things in the notes during this, so I will frequently MAFO very detailed world questions.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294188343183429633)

Please do remember the hashtag. Also, I'll try to @ people directly to not flood your Twitter streams, so search for #torchat to watch.

## Entry #23

#### [Kamarile Sedai (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/AmyrlinEgwene/status/294187860003803136)

Brandon, does the Oath Rod continue to be used in the Fourth Age? If so, for what purpose?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294188467477413888)

So far as I know, yes. And for the same purpose.

#### [Raj Iyer](https://twitter.com/iyer5/status/294188838807535616)

Do other groups start using the Rod too?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196013562986496)

Do you think the Aes Sedai are likely to let others manhandle one of their
*ter'angreal*
?

#### [Kamarile Sedai](https://twitter.com/AmyrlinEgwene/status/294188877873295361)

Did men start to use the Oath Rod too, or did it continue to be only women?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196202050818048)

No men. Neither group would like that. The Asha'man are NOT male Aes Sedai. RJ was clear about this in the notes.

#### [Keith Martin](https://twitter.com/kam2112/status/294190407976366083)

Will the White and Black Towers reunite to form one Aes Sedai again?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204009101807616)

RJ was clear to me that the Asha'man were not Aes Sedai, and were not going to become them.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204076424572928)

That said, a united male/female Aes Sedai will come again someday.

#### Footnote

Brandon is probably not referring to the 4th Age in his last tweet; more likely he's talking about the next turning of the Wheel.

I don't have the timeline handy. For Rand, you could measure it in hours. Outside, weeks stretching to months.

#### [Jeffrey Bernard (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Kiroshadow/status/294188000324231170)

With all the deaths that occurred in
*A Memory of Light*
, were there any that hit you harder than any others?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294188996983156736)

Egwene. After that, Bela. I'd promised she would live, but Harriet decided that I was cheating to keep her alive.

#### [Raj Ayer](http://twitter.com/iyer5/status/294191310653509632)

How long did it take you to write Egwene's death? What were your emotions then? How much had RJ written of it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207875935502337)

It was a hard one, to be sure. Hardest in the books. Had a long conversation with Team Jordan about how to manage it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207924702703617)

RJ had not written much of that sequence.

#### [Andy Lee](https://twitter.com/AndyLee19261637/status/294189599197126656)

Why did Egwene have to die? Very sad.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294199986730704897)

I agree. But if you look at the arc of her character, you might begin to see why it was important.

#### [Travis Hall](https://twitter.com/travishall456/status/294188886773608448)

Without spoilers, were there any characters you want to kill/save that you couldn't do to Jordan's wishes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196450655625216)

There was one. But it was Harriet's call, not RJ's, that ended them.

#### [Bellygod](https://twitter.com/Bellygod0607/status/294189008181944321)

Who did you find hardest to kill?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294197173275463680)

Egwene by a mile. Followed by Bela.

#### [Bellygod](https://twitter.com/Bellygod0607/status/294190813167099904)

Why did you kill Bela?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205146043396096)

I tried to keep her alive! Harriet told me I'd put her in too bad a situation, and she needed to die.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205181602701312)

She was right, of course, but it still hurts.

## Entry #26

#### [Dennis (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/den_down_unda/status/294188031794114562)

I notice that Rand referred to Moridin as "Elan," not "Elan Morin." Why that stylistic choice?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294189396670963712)

Rand didn't think he deserved the third name.

#### [Dennis](http://twitter.com/den_down_unda/status/294189708530040833)

But Elan Morin were his two names, like Lews Therin. Tedronai was his third name.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294200647719481345)

Speaking as Rand does was an intentional insult, as per my understanding via the notes.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294202268935405569)

I saw it as a familiarity, since he calls Ilyena by her first name only. Well, so does everyone...(she has three).

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215024866648065)

I view it this way, but it might be colored by my own personal experience. In Korea, using a very familial tone...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215132597342208)

...is either endearing or incredibly offensive, depending on your relationship to the person. That's how I see it here.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215247743561730)

At times, honestly, I don't know if Rand is intending insult or familiarity—perhaps both.

#### [Jared Garrett (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/jaredgarrett/status/294188049435344897)

How did it feel to be one of the only humans who knew who killed Asmodean?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294189501281083392)

Fun, but also annoying, since I couldn't tell anyone.

#### [Kevin Cantrell](https://twitter.com/kevinrcantrell/status/294190854741049344)

Did Graendal kill Asmodean? Huge fan of yours and WOT, first read
*The Eye of the World*
when I was 13, 15 years ago.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205391812825089)

Yes, she did. And thanks!

## Entry #28

#### [Jay Fonseca (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/RotorNurse/status/294188072885690370)

So I always wondered... what ever happened to the Tinkers' song? Did I miss a resolution to that arc?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294189727131766784)

By specific instruction from RJ, the Tinkers have not found their song as of the end of
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294189928173162498)

The song of growing is not their "Song." The Song is a much more deep and philosophical concept, perhaps unattainable.

#### [TJ](https://twitter.com/Cyan220/status/294188324153872384)

Do you imagine that Rand teaches "the song" to the Tu'athan after the events of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191869288673280)

Rand does not know The Song. Anything he'd try to teach them, they would not accept as The Song.

#### [Aaron Oster](https://twitter.com/TheAOster/status/294190111845916672)

Wait, are you saying Rand's song that Mat recognized wasn't the Tinkers' song?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203638291787776)

The Tinker "Song" is an ideal that goes far beyond any song that has actually ever existed.

## Entry #29

#### [John Martin (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/IoannesMartinus/status/294188104548491264)

Okay, the pipe lighting . . . Any real explanation, or are we just going to wonder forever?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190059639427072)

I put it in as RJ instructed, and I know nothing more about it than fandom does, I'm afraid.

#### [James Starke](http://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294188328499150848)

Popular theory is that from his time with the Dark One/Creator/Pattern, he's able to manipulate The Pattern a bit.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191921298026497)

This is a good theory.

#### [Jonathan B](https://twitter.com/ka243/status/294190718396805122)

What's your opinion on how pipe lighting was or could have been done even if we don't have RJ's answer?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205006062698496)

Ha. I agree with some of the fan discussions.

#### [Andrew Mudge](https://twitter.com/AndrewMudge/status/294192341282074625)

Is Rand the missing link between the Pattern and the Creator himself, possibly even the balancer of light/dark?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210595413168129)

That's one possible theory.

#### [Mike Ball](https://twitter.com/MtnMikeBall/status/294188392240009217)

How did Rand light the pipe at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294192066588712960)

I know no more on this than fandom does, I'm afraid. RJ did not explain.

#### [Terry Benton](https://twitter.com/terrybenton/status/294188518782169088)

I still can't figure it out...how did Rand light his pipe? Is he in
*Tel'aran'rhioid*
? Is everybody??

#### [Dan Zambito](https://twitter.com/Historytechbito/status/294188658553135104)

Can you explain how Rand lit his pipe in the last scene? Did he discover a new power? Is he a new power?

#### [Brandon](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294193167580942336) [Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294195610494582784)

I'm afraid I don't know anything more than fandom does about this. RJ did not leave notes on the matter.

## Entry #30

#### [Alexi (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Fatal_Romantic/status/294188116279959552)

Is there a possibility of a new series focusing on the Seanchan?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190187829927938)

Afraid not. RJ did not leave notes about that series, and we feel that to do it would be exploiting his legacy.

#### [Keith Martin](https://twitter.com/kam2112/status/294189396792578049)

Do you think you might revisit WoT to continue some of the stories left untold?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198708613050368)

No. It is very unlikely. I feel that from here out, writing in the WoT world would be against RJ's wishes.

#### [Jade Kazmierski](https://twitter.com/jadekaz/status/294189640968196097)

I understand the series as it were is complete, but is there any chance for further novellas?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294200098357919744)

Unlikely. I don't believe that RJ would want us to do that.

#### [Marcel Stokvis](https://twitter.com/MarcelStokvis/status/294190028148596736)

Will you be finishing the prequels as well?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203371756347393)

Unlikely. I don't think RJ would want me to.

#### [Henry Koivuneva](https://twitter.com/hkoivuneva/status/294190632266780672)

Rereading the series, what is your opinion, could more books be written on the Fourth Age?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204561814597632)

Yes, many could—but they would be our projections, not RJ's vision. So we shouldn't do them.

#### [Neil Ritchie](https://twitter.com/Neiley83/status/294192576016293888)

Is this the absolute end? Darkfriends must still exist and the future is very unclear. Seems scope for more?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211874738798592)

It is not the end, but it is the end of what we will write. The rest is left to fan imaginations.

## Entry #31

#### [Radbeard (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Radbeard/status/294188138870484992)

Don't you feel some of the character endings were too rushed (Fain, everyone Demandred killed)?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190444575858689)

Finishing everything that RJ left to be finished in the amount of space required results in some dynamic pacing.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190524041134080)

I don't feel rushed is the right term. But I can see how people might feel that way. I could have gone three more books.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190653108269057)

It was not right to do so. This was what he wanted, and I did my best to fit everything in. I'm pleased with the result.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190783106539520)

In regards to your specific questions, the Demandred kills were supposed to be abrupt to convey emotion of sudden loss.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190893634818048)

That's how things are in war. As for Fain, a piece of me does wish there had been time for more with him.

#### [Brett](https://twitter.com/Angrypecos/status/294190891579609088)

Do you plan on expanding on the Wheel of Time series more or is it done? Why did you have so many abrupt deaths?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205868482908161)

No, no more. RJ wouldn't want it. Abrupt deaths happen in war; it is the way this sort of thing plays out, I'm afraid.

#### [Daniel Egonsson](https://twitter.com/DanielEgonsson/status/294192671575126016)

Was there anything in
*A Memory of Light*
you wished you could have changed?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212202234253312)

I might have done more with Fain if I'd had the time and the pages.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212287856791552)

The biggest challenge for the book was fitting everyone in, and making sure they had relevant things to do.

#### [Indigo Kae (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/indigokae/status/294188154733334528)

Is the woman who told Rand at the end that he was right to bring Moridin, Nakomi?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191054712889344)

I have been advised to RAFO questions regarding most everything from there on.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191171146764288)

It's funny to say RAFO when there is no more to read, but what that term means is "This is supposed to be ambiguous."

#### [David Catherine](https://twitter.com/DavidCatherine/status/294192437071593472)

With all of the homages to global myths/legends, is Nakomi the Wandering Jew/Jenn?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211090022268928)

That's a very clever question that nobody has yet asked me. I'm not going to say more, however.

#### [Ryan Lee](https://twitter.com/RyanCurtissLee/status/294190000801730560)

I gotta ask, is Nakomi / the Woman at the End a Shard of Adonalsium? Perhaps Balance?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294202997699919873)

No. There is not crossover between my shared world and the Wheel of Time. (Sorry.)

#### [kcf](https://twitter.com/nethspace/status/294191064212971520)

Who helped Rand out of the Shayol Ghul after the fight with the Dark One and told him he knew what he needed to do?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294206478208888832)

Hi, Neth. This is one I'm not answering, but if you track me down in person, you might be able to beat it out of me.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294199631074697218)

Is Nakomi the avatar of the Creator?

#### [Werthead](https://twitter.com/Werthead/status/294200152158253056)

SIFADFOE (Scream In Frustration And Don't Find Out, Ever) :-)

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294201242392072193)

Yay, that means I can officially not give a shit about Nakomi. :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215450898870272)

You are allowed that right officially. She's becoming the Asmodean kill of this sequence of books.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215564262522881)

I, of course, should have realized she'd become so big a thing as she did—but that wasn't the intention.

#### [Melissa Houghton](https://twitter.com/MissyHoughton/status/294188274388455426)

I want to know what the heck was with Nakomi—who/what she is. Also was that her at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191430992265216)

Just answered this. Have a look below. (Sorry. It's a RAFO, I'm afraid.)

#### [Peter Wikberg](https://twitter.com/wikberget/status/294188953186226176)

Who/What is Nakomi?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196661650092033)

That is a good question, but not one I'm planning to answer any time soon. (sorry.)

#### [Arran Cook](https://twitter.com/Arrannnn/status/294189315582484480)

Who was Nakomi? How did the body swap happen? How did Rand light the pipe?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198148539244544)

You've asked all three of the big questions I'm not allowed or unable to answer, I'm afraid.

#### [Lachie Stoller](https://twitter.com/Lachiestoller/status/294189319046963200)

Who was the old Aiel lady at the end of Rand's battle?

#### [James Starke](https://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294189559615463424)

Is Nakomi the person that Rand encountered at the mouth of Shayol Ghul? And is she the embodiment of The Creator?

#### [Brandon](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198339614941184) [Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294199718291054594)

This is one that I'm not answering, I'm afraid. RJ wanted some things about the ending to remain ambiguous.

## Entry #33

#### [Kirsten Gesenberg (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/SUNNYCR0W/status/294188315891097600)

Which scene is the "last scene" that RJ said he wrote first?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191758324154368)

Pipe scene.

#### Footnote

RJ always said he
*could*
have written the scene in 1984, but he
[didn't actually write it](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#13)
until he was working on
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [James Starke](https://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294188553234169856)

Robert Jordan wrote the entire epilogue.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294193957720698881)

Almost all. There were a few small inserts by me. Perrin was mine in the epilogue.

#### [Mike Cox](https://twitter.com/Mikecox20/status/294190007906873344)

I would like to know, how much of the last chapter was written by RJ and how much did you do?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203184098967552)

I did Perrin and some of the in-between writing with Loial. RJ did Mat, Rand, scene exiting the mountain, and others.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203285911519232)

There are places where I tweaked bits, per editing, and places where I slipped in things he'd written to my sequences.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294200837700481024)

Was the last scene written or dictated?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215896157806592)

Written down. As was the scene with Isam [in] the prologue.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294216006199558144)

The Borderlander tower scene was dictated, I believe.

Great structure from @BrandSanderson, by the way. The book required you break normal structural rules in just the right way. Great work.

Thanks, Bob. You rock.

#### [An Algorithm](http://twitter.com/an_Algorithm/status/294188719144050689)

So what kind of prewriting did you do for
*A Memory of Light*
@BrandSanderson?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294195744112517122)

Lots of practicing character viewpoints. I also make a huge outline, which started on big sheets of butcher paper.

#### [Sandy Stuckless](https://twitter.com/SandyRStuckless/status/294192367349678081)

Is there anything specific process-wise you learned from completing WoT that you will apply to future projects?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210689340436482)

I'm in awe of RJ's subtlety and hope to be able to transfer my understanding of that to my own works.

Did the ending of
*A Memory of Light*
influence the end of
*Emperor's Soul*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191586911334400)

Not intentionally, but it's hard not to be influenced by projects like this.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191708873310209)

For example, I wrote
*Rithmatist*
while developing the revision for
*The Way of Kings*
, and both ended up with a redhead artist.

#### [Brent Holmes](https://twitter.com/BrentAtGazette/status/294192496215486464)

Did the confrontation between Vin and Ruin in
*Hero of Ages*
influence the Rand v Dark One scenes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211256200617984)

Everything I do influences everything else, so I'd say yes—but in this case, I had RJ guiding me as a greater influence.

#### [Simon Ponder](https://twitter.com/lenire/status/294190621302853633)

How does it feel now that the Wheel of Time is over?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204442742513664)

Sad. Awesome, but sad.

#### [Chris from Jax](https://twitter.com/ckiernan99/status/294192657960419329)

Is it tough knowing you can't continue the story?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212090036633600)

Yes, and no. I feel the ending is the right one. And I can imagine in my head what happens, so for me, that is enough.

What would've happened had Elayne not bonded Birgitte, given how Birgitte's death went in

Yes, I did. But I can ALWAYS see more room to expand. Part of being an epic fantasy writer, I suppose...

#### [Aaron Oster (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/TheAOster/status/294188605818150914)

If, hypothetically, there was a body switch in WoT, how would it happen? Would it be an actual switch or illusion?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294194284054315009)

There are far more reasons, worldbuilding wise, to believe it was real than to believe it was illusion.

#### [TJ](https://twitter.com/Cyan220/status/294189172212785152)

Is Rand's soul in Moridin's body?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294197597407698944)

Ha. Right to the point, are you? Let's just say that trickery is not likely in this case.

#### [TJ](https://twitter.com/Cyan220/status/294192684925603840)

Can you confirm that Rand's body was burned at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212501393006593)

Okay, fine. Yes, I will confirm that Rand's body was indeed the one that was burned. :)

#### [Jonathan MacAlpine](https://twitter.com/apocriva/status/294191658122240002)

Why didn't anybody notice when a supposedly-dead Moridin got up and walked away?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209086491332609)

I'd say coincidence. But there aren't many of those in the WoT world.

#### [Siraaj](https://twitter.com/siraaj/status/294191133075070977)

Seems like a conversation between the Creator and Rand was missing where "switch" and Alivia's role in it are laid out—thoughts?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207520308854784)

I believe that RJ included everything he wanted in this sequence.

#### [Jason Cassidy](https://twitter.com/jaybone1978/status/294189990060118017)

Why did Rand switch bodies at the end and why is he going incognito now? Did not understand that part.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294202910710054912)

RJ wrote these scenes, and intended to leave them as is. I don't think me delving into explanations is what he'd want.

#### [El Brian](https://twitter.com/El_Brian/status/294189325938216960)

Did the bonding between Rand, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Min transfer over to the new body?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198504996352000)

Yes, though I don't know how or why.

#### [Kamarile Sedai](https://twitter.com/AmyrlinEgwene/status/294190127251587073)

Why did the bond survive the body switch at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203714208669699)

I don't know. RJ did not explain this one to me.

#### [J Crosby](https://twitter.com/Xolsiion/status/294190453912371200)

How were Rand/Elan able to switch bodies?

#### [Sean Duffy](https://twitter.com/kqrpnb/status/294191502031216640)

How did Rand wind up with Moridin's body?

#### [James Starke](https://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294192889825751041)

Could you explain further about the body switch and how it was possible?

#### [Brandon](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204180200050691) [Sander](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208237388042240) [son](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294213565861199872)

This is one that I'm not answering, I'm afraid. RJ wanted some things about the ending to remain ambiguous.

Dobraine makes it. RJ's only note on him for the last book was that he was at Merrilor when Rand/Egwene clashed. Dobraine...

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294197319526662145)

The husk that Rand sees, which gave birth to the void. Second: Almost all, but a few were left open and decided by us.

#### [Andy Nogar](http://twitter.com/cursor_mortis/status/294191422154895361)

What happened to Shaidar Haran? He seems to have dropped off the face of Randland.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294200181036032000)

Easiest: Perrin. Hardest: Mat. Followed by Aviendha and Tuon.

#### [Dave West](https://twitter.com/dwestthreefold/status/294192503178006529)

Now that you're finished, what was your favorite scene to write? Character?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211345879007232)

Perrin, and the forging of his hammer. In
*A Memory of Light*
it was the sequence with Lan near the end.

#### [Dan Zambito](https://twitter.com/Historytechbito/status/294192631053946881)

Is Gaidal Cain, Grady's kid, Gadren?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294201779225235456)

That's a good theory. Some fans think he would be too old, however. What do you think?

#### Footnote

According to RJ's
[comments](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#23)
on the subject, he is too old; Rand thought he was about four years old in
*Lord of Chaos*
, and even if Rand was off, Gaidal can't have been any more than two months old at the time, and was more likely just being born. It stretches credulity that Rand would have mistaken a newborn baby for a four-year-old child.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294202192221573120)

One thing that was made clear in the notes is that not everything seen by Min is to have significance for the books.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294202412770660352)

And others, such as Alivia, were to be things that people in world placed much import upon—but were actually minor.

Multiple factions, but not all by a long shot.

#### [Matt Walsh](https://twitter.com/mattwalsh12/status/294190094070472704)

Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't RJ say in a interview that Shara wouldn't be involved in any of the WoT books?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203502966734848)

The quotes I've seen say that nothing significant would happen there on screen.

#### Footnote

Brandon is correct; RJ never said that Shara would play no role at all, just that the story would travel to Shara itself for more than a brief visit comparable to Rand's and Aviendha's trip to Seanchan.

#### [Mike W](https://twitter.com/paxeternus/status/294191571551797251)

How can you still be RAFO'ing stuff? What is left to read?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208505773174784)

To RJ, RAFO sometimes meant "Read, think about it, and decide." It didn't always mean "I'll give an answer."

#### [Peter Binkowski](https://twitter.com/peterbinks/status/294191774337990656)

Is 'RAFO' basically to mean we're never going to find some things out?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209176907968513)

There's a "Talk it over, see if you can figure it out" aspect to it as well.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205499405131776)

No, he didn't, but I just couldn't fit it in logistically.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205682440351744)

Mat/Perrin Rand/Perrin and Rand/Mat from these two books was my nod toward that.

Any chance of Birgitte or Egwene being reborn as one of Melaine's twins?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294206144791056384)

I can't remember what RJ has said about when a spirit is linked to a body in WoT terms.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294206815485427712)

viability.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294214846390603777)

I thought that's what he had said. So I'd say there is a chance. (But as you can guess, the notes don't say.)

When was the second time that Mat had died? Was it when he was 'reborn' with a new name from his marriage?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294206911300112385)

Rahvin's attack.

#### Footnote

For the record, this is the only time Mat died; there was nothing in what the Aelfinn said about him dying twice, though presumably he'll die again some day.

Was wondering why the ending there was no conversation between Hawking and Tuon.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207726991585280)

You're assuming because it wasn't shown on screen, it didn't happen...

#### [Brent Holmes](https://twitter.com/BrentAtGazette/status/294191619018719234)

What happened in the conversation between Tuon and Arthur Hawkwing?!?!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208578254938112)

It was interesting, I'll tell you that much.

#### [Melissa Houghton](https://twitter.com/MissyHoughton/status/294192407623385089)

Did Hawkwing talk with Tuon?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210792918753280)

Yes.

#### [Nick](https://twitter.com/ampsonic/status/294192561684373504)

How do you think Fortuona reacted to speaking with Hawking?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211553153138689)

With great consternation.

Who's the POV for "River of Souls" in Unfettered?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209232528613376)

What's so evil about going to the wolf dream in the flesh? Seems like a gun on the mantle that never got fired??

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209343912546308)

In this case, "Evil" depends on ones perspective. I don't think it's evil, personally.

So, is it implied that once the Wheel turns again, this whole Dark One vs The World will go down again as well?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209914669236226)

Everything in the WoT world repeats. Not always exactly the same, though.

Was there any details to how
*Callandor*
was created in the notes RJ left?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210881443745792)

Yes, there were some. I might try to get more in the encyclopedia.

Did all of the balefire cracks disappear after the Last Battle? If not, was Egwene's weave discovered again?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212626668482561)

The world will heal itself, with time, even without the weave. But the weave was witnessed.

When Faile, Olver, etc escaped through the gateway to Merrilor, where did Setalle go? If you told us, I missed it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294213093213491200)

She makes it through the chaos alive.

When did Taim become a Darkfriend? Was he a Darkfriend as false Dragon? Why did he use Age of Legends era phrasing (so-called Aiel)?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294213488585342976)

Taim was recruited by one of the Forsaken, so it happened after they were free.

I'm going to MAFO this one, since I honestly can't remember. I did get an answer from Maria as I was writing the books, though.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=7900)

I'm going to plead the encyclopedia on this one.

Okay, so I went an hour and 45 minutes and Still have over 500 questions. I'm sorry to cut the #torchat off here. :(

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294214124324392960)

We just received word that
*A Memory of Light*
is #1 on the
*New York Times*
list for the second week in a row. Wow!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294214186672738304)

It would be easy to keep going for the next six hours, but I don't have the time. I'll do more Q&A sessions in the next few weeks. #torchat

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294214342914764800)

For now, we'll get the transcript of this up, and maybe you'll find that someone else asked your question. Thanks, all! #torchat
