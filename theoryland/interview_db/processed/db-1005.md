## Entry #1

#### [vehiclestarsÂ ()](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/186f28/met_brandon_sanderson_and_harriet_today/c8c2886)

Met Brandon Sanderson and Harriet today.

#### Harriet McDougal (paraphrased)

I found out a fact I didn't previously know while there and that was that Harriet also edited
*Ender's Game*
, as well as
*The Way of Kings*
.

#### 17thShard

Just a small side note, but Harriet was a guest editor on
*The Way of Kings*
. Brandon's normal editor Moshe did edit the book as normal.

I couldn't believe when I heard that Harriet edited
*Ender's Game*
, as I loved that book growing up.

#### vehiclestars

Yeah I was surprised. Two of my personal favorites, WOT and
*Ender's Game*
. If she had done
*Dune*
too she would be a god.
