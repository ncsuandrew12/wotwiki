## Entry #4

#### Shardlet

You said previously that a slider's bubble is anchored to its position on Scadrial rather than on the slider's position or on the train (if the burner was on a train). If the slider was on a rock in space, would the bubble be anchored to a position relative to Scadrial, the rock or something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #5

#### Shardlet

A slider and a pulser are standing near each other and each put up a bubble. Neither is standing close enough to the other to be within the other's bubble, but they are near enough that their bubbles would overlap what effect would you have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The bubbles would overlap and it would be like a Venn diagram (i.e., outside both bubbles-normal time, in sliders bubble-fast time, in pulser's bubble-slow time, in the overlap-normal time).

## Entry #6

#### Shardlet

If a time bubble is raised in a vacuum, is the diameter larger than a bubble raised in atmosphere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, atmosphere has no effect on bubble diameter.

## Entry #7

#### Shardlet

If a Scadrian allomancer had a baby with a Nalthian (and the baby was born on Nalthis), could the baby have an original Breath and also be a Natural allomancer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It could happen, the baby would have a bit of Preservation and a bit of Endowment.
