## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

For those who enjoy hanging out and playing Magic, it looks like I'll be able to swing going to the prerelease of the new core set this weekend. I'll be doing it at Epic Puzzles & Games in SLC, like previous prereleases, at midnight on Friday night.

No need to sign up this time if you want to come. Just drop by at midnight and we'll figure out what we're doing. Look forward to seeing some of you there.
