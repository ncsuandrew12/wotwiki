## Entry #1

#### Austin Sirkin

I recently received a letter from RJ. I'm posting all of the info I think is worthwhile. Have fun!

#### Robert Jordan

I wrote "Jak o' the Shadows" to the tune of "Gary Owen," but I suppose anybody can put the words to what they wish.

## Entry #3

#### Robert Jordan

Wait till the
*Guide to The Wheel*
is out and check a copy. There will be some stuff that isn't in the books. Maps, expansion on some material, historical notes, that sort of thing.

## Entry #4

#### Robert Jordan

The unabridged audio tape should be neat, nifty, and other outdated slang. It will be just what it says: every word of the books. I am talking with the audio publisher about having sections from a male point-of-view read by a man and those from a female point-of-view read by a woman. I think it will make it even better.

I'm not signing any books soon, just writing one.

#### Austin Sirkin
