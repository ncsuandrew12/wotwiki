## Entry #4

#### Question

Why can Shallan draw the Cryptics without seeing them, and can she do the same for other invisible (to her?) spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Shallan and the Cryptics have a "special connection" that allows her to draw them.

## Entry #5

#### Question

None of the Heralds mention or address the Almighty in the opening scene of
*The Way of Kings*
; it's a little strange, considering they are his champions. Have they seen or spoken to the Almighty?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, the Heralds have spoken with the Almighty. They also feel that what has been done to them is partially his fault.

## Entry #6

#### Question

Any news on Mistborn: Birthright?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Pushed back to 2015, so it can be developed for the next generation consoles.

## Entry #7

#### Question

Ruin and Preservation were often represented in the Mistborn trilogy in terms of black and white. Is this imagery limited to that series, or do other Shards also have an associated hue?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This (Ruin & Preservation's colors) was because of the specific world and their perception of the world and themselves. Essentially, because of the dynamics of the interplay between Ruin and Preservation, they "chose" to view themselves as black and white respectively, so that's how they were represented. Also, because the only two Shards on Scadrial, and their natures were opposites, after the long period of time they spent on the same planet, they kind of "polarized." If a similar thing happened on another world, a similar coloring effect could happen.

## Entry #8

#### Question

How is it that Nightblood, who is merely a near-sentient awakened object, was able to read minds, something a Shard like Ruin was unable to do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It requires bonding (with the person whose mind is to be read) to read minds.

## Entry #9

#### Question

What is the definition of a focus (in
*The Way of Kings*
' Ars Arcanum)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Foci, though linked to the magic system, are more like artifacts of the philosophy surrounding the magic system. A focus is a philosophical concept, rather than a hardfast rule related to the magic system. A man-made, artificial way of explaining the magic system. Like the periodic table.

## Entry #12

#### Question

What effects does being a Sliver have on a person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It can vary (on the Shard, the length of time the power was held, the power itself, etc). In some way a Sliver is someone who has had their mind, body, and spirit expanded due to holding a great deal of power, and then have had that power leave.

#### Question

Is spiritual DNA inherited the same as regular DNA?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Inherited similarly, but not 100% identically, to regular DNA.

## Entry #15

#### Question

Did all orders of Knights Radiants use Shardplate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was available to all of them, and they could (all) use it. Many Knights (not Orders) chose not to. There were Knights who were not soldiers and had not interest in wearing Shardplate.

## Entry #16

#### Question

How does one erase/alter memories using Breath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

breath

## Entry #17

#### Question

Why do the Returned need to sleep?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sleep is necessary for many reasons - different from the reasons we need food and water, for example. One of those reasons (for sleep) is memory storage. Like humans, Returned need to sleep so their (important) short-term memories get moved to long-term storage.
