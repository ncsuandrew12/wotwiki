## Entry #1

#### Question

What is the setup for the prequels?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon responded that he is not sure. He states that he doesn't want it to be an eternal series, and suggests being very careful. He will go with whatever is the will of Harriet. Also possible to do outriggers, again depends on Harriet. There is a chance of both, Tom Doherty wants them both, so in the end it will be up to Harriet and Brandon will go along with whatever she wants and decides on.

## Entry #2

#### Question

What are the new chapter symbols?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Harriet names the chapters actually, so she sent over a list of all symbols and chapters, and wanted me to pick out symbols to go with the chapters. Brandon pushed for new symbols. He wanted a symbol to show the pattern unfurling. So that's what you get with chapter. Also Brandon chose Perrin's blacksmith puzzle for his own symbol on the author page.

## Entry #3

#### Question

Which character do you most identify with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that it depends on when he read the series through. When he first started reading he really was identifying with Rand, simply because they were both teenagers, so he naturally connected with how he felt. Then he started feeling for Perrin, slightly more mature, also because of the similarities in personality. This last time he read through the series for
*The Gathering Storm*
, he most identified with Moiraine and Nynaeve, because he, as a father in his 30's, can see the wisdom and guidance that they have to impart, and how better things would be if the boys just did what they were supposed to, unlike when he was younger when he would simply wish that they would stop butting in all the time.

## Entry #4

#### Question

How do you keep from being burnt out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that he switches projects continually. He wrote 13 standalone books before he ever got one published, that being
*Elantris*
, his sixth novel. "I write compulsively." That's where Alcatraz came from: he needed a break from Mistborn, and so he stopped for a time and wrote a light Young Adult novel. He would often take a Saturday off in the middle of a project, and write something completely different, something he wasn't necessarily supposed to.

## Entry #11

#### Question

What's most difficult in the writing process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Keeping track of everyone. I was confused about who was with Perrin, so I asked Charleston for a file with every one of the Two Rivers characters, who's with them. They sent over a file of a complete list of Two Rivers folk with Perrin, most of whom hadn't even been mentioned, and it had things like their names, relations, and for most of them, what they did in the army.
