## Entry #1

#### Robert Jordan

I also asked him if Asmodean and Slayer had met each other before he was killed, and he said they hadn't met.
But Slayer knows of all the Forsaken and they know he exist!

RJ also said (for fun) he suspected Nynaeve to have killed Asmodean and that Moridin is hiding as Nynaeve:)
(Poor Lan)

Nynaeve also had a good childhood, but she already tried to bully people:)

He has told a lot more, but I will hopefully get later a full report of someone else who had taped every conversation.

bye Isabel
