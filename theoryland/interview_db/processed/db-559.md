## Entry #1

#### Res Ipsa

At the Cincinnati signing I asked Brandon a question concerning our favorite killing machine!

I asked Brandon since Shadowspawn die when they go through gateways was the
*gholam*
dead, or is it a construct?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon explained to me that it was not Shadowspawn and a gateway would not kill it. However he went on about
*gholam*
being limited by someone who can Travel.

#### Res\_Ispa

I didn't push that response because someone constantly being hunted would invariably have a moment where they were unawares so it was not really a limitation for the
*gholam*
to hunt channelers who can Travel.

An obvious RAFO would we be seeing this particular
*gholam*
again? I did not ask it though.
