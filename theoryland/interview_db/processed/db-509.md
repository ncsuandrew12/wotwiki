## Entry #1

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Brandon's assistant Peter here. He's hard at work on
*Towers of Midnight*
, which you know if you've been following on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
. And I've been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work for
*The Way of Kings*
release (the book is being composited as we speak and is due back from proofreading on Friday). So we're a bit behind on updates.

The most recent Mistborn 3 annotations cover
[Allomantic secrets including atium Mistings](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/350/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Seventy-Four)
and
[the kandra coup and Sazed's decision](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/351/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Seventy-Five)
. I've got the next four annotations queued, which should tide you over until we've got the KINGS proofs approved and I can line up the rest.

There are three new episodes of the writing advice podcast Brandon does with Howard Tayler and Dan Wells that haven't been mentioned on the blog. First up is a talk with Isaac Stewart, interior artist for the Mistborn books and one of the artists for
*The Way of Kings*
, about the
[visual elements of storytelling](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/04/18/)
. Next up is
[breaking the fourth wall](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/04/25/)
, again with Isaac (who is also half of the team behind the webcomic
*Rocket Road Trip*
with
*Warbreaker*
map artist Shawn Boyles). And finally is
[Living with the Artist](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/05/02/)
which features Sandra Tayler, Dawn Wells, and Kenny Pike talking about what roles they play in their spouses' careers, among other things. (Kenny is a former student of Brandon's whose wife Aprilynne's book
[*Wings*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061668052?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
hit #1 on the
*New York Times*
list. Who Sandra and Dawn are should be obvious.)
