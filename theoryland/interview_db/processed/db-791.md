## Entry #1

#### AtlantaRand

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet mentioned in the Kaffeklatsch that it was possible
*A Memory of Light*
would end up being too big to fit in one volume, and so it might end up two books. But then Sanderson in the status update really didn't leave much opening that it would at all be possible. So.....

That was the one shocker that I heard personally, but there could be others. Oh yeah and
*A Memory of Light*
released November 2012, but I'm sure that's been mentioned somewhere else.

She hinted at that it would be a big book. I think that she said something that if
*A Memory of Light*
would be something like 500,000 words it would have to be split.

She could be preparing me for a small chance that it would be that big.
