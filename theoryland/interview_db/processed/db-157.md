## Entry #1

#### Robert Jordan

His speech went the same as [usual.] Mr. Jordan corrected the pronunciations of certain names. After that he pointed out to the room to answer questions for the fans. My favorite answer was when someone asked if he'd write
*Conan*
again. Mr. Jordan replied, "If God, himself told me to write
*Conan*
, again I'd say, Satan already told me to and I turned him down. So maybe we can make a deal." After finishing up the fans' questions he told us that he was going to step down from the stage and enjoy lots of gin and sign our books.

## Entry #2

#### Darrell Durham

It was really wonderful to meet one of my favorite authors and have a book signed.

I hope the rest of the fans get out to this event.
