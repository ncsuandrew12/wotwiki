## Entry #1

#### Jakobus

First of all. WOW!!!!!! I cannot express how much I enjoyed this series! I was extremely happy to finally meet you at the Provo signing, so now 2 of my top 3 authors ardown (unfortunately I can't meet RJ, ) Anyhow here is my question
Will Vin and Elend fade like mistborn? or will they live on as the "father and mother" of the new world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks Jakobus!

I just answered this one, kind of, just above. I'm afraid it's rather vague. But they won't 'fade' away.

#### Footnote

You can see several references to Vin and Elend in Alloy of Law
