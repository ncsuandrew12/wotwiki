## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

On August 21st there will be a writing workshop in South Sandy, Utah whose purpose is to raise money to donate to schoolchildren. Specifically, they hope to donate a book to every child "in at least ten of the lowest socioeconomic populated schools in the state"â€”at least 6,000 books total. Author Shannon Hale told me about the program, and I'm going to be attending the evening extravaganza. As this is a charity event, there is a registration fee both for the writing workshop during the day and the extravaganza in the evening. For more information, please
[see the website](http://www.writingforcharity.com/)
.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

Before the 21st I'll have turned in the final revision of
*Towers of Midnight*
, which I'm currently working on. You can follow my progress on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
; the deadline is August 16th and I need to finish over 10% of the book each day until then. I did the first 12% yesterday. This final draft mostly focuses on issues the beta readers noticed.

## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

A couple of weeks ago on Writing Excuses, Dan, Howard, and I did some example line editing on the beginning of
[the first novel I wrote](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/07/25/)
. It went over very well, so in this week's episode we return to
*White Sand*
and
[line edit the dialogue](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/08/08/)
. You want to listen to it, right?

In the most recent
*Warbreaker*
annotations I talk about chapter four. First I discuss
[the name system used in the book](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/377/Warbreaker-Chapter-Four)
, and then I cover
[Hawaii and the undead](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/378/Warbreaker-Chapter-Four-Part-2)
.
