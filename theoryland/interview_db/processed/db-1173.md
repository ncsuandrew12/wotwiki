## Entry #1

#### Question

I asked him if a feruchemist were to visit Earth and tap Duralumin, could they do something as involved as talk local sports with someone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said No -- when you trick your spirit into thinking it's from where you're currently tapping, it's not a full transformation, like Sel-ish magic making a copy.. It doesn't just fill your head with things from the place you're visiting.

## Entry #2

#### Question

I also asked if hemalurgy could be performed anywhere in the Cosmere. Pretty sure that's something we knew already, but I asked if anyone could do it if they knew what they were doing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said Yes.

#### Question

So, I continued, hemalurgy is unique because not only can the power of Ruin be accessed anywhere (not just on Scadrial), but also by anyone (not just someone who's invested).

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said it is weird that way.

#### Footnote

:-) It is interesting: I can't think of any other Shardic power that's so universally accessible.
