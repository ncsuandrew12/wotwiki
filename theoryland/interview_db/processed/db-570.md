## Entry #1

#### RDDK

I asked Brandon how, now that Mesaana is braindead and all, she got around the Oath Rod.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He told me that one of the three ways the Aes Sedai had surmised was correct. Considering it probably would have been mentioned if they found an Oath Rod among her things, that it probably was the weave the investigators had rediscovered.
