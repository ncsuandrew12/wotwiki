## Entry #1

#### Terez

I was going to do a proper report with lots of nice pictures and all, but after my work got eaten twice, I gave up, so now I'm just copying over the on-the-spot report I made at Dragonmount during the con.

## Entry #2

#### Terez

Sitting at the Verin panel with Maria now. One question answered, that Harriet declined to answer before:

#### Question

Was Verin at the Darkfriend Social?

#### Maria Simons

I believe she was.

## Entry #3

#### Ishara

Only three characters in the series used the phrase 'it's time to roll the dice': Mat, Pedron Niall, and Verin. Is there any significance to that?

#### Maria Simons

No. (implication is that it's not an uncommon phrase)

## Entry #8

#### Terez

Southpaw reported that Wilson said Rand's fate will not be left open at the end of the book; we will know what happens to him.

#### [Austin Moore](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/69762-amol-reading-at-jordancon/#entry2267448)

Here is a pretty accurate way Wilson described to me my question about Rand. It is not 100% word for word but very very close. We had been talking about multiple things for a bit so I decided to throw him a question that I know has been discussed here and there among fans.

## Entry #9

#### [Austin MooreÂ ()](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/69762-amol-reading-at-jordancon/#entry2267448)

So I've been wondering, and I think many others have as well, will we know for 100% sure what Rand's fate is at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Wilson Grooms

Oh yes. There will be NO doubt in anyone's mind what Rands fate will be at the end. It will sure to surprise and amaze people. When Jim (RJ) told me how the series ended I just shook my head and said, "Bubba, that is just beautiful. Just beautiful." So yes, you will all know.

#### Austin Moore

Ok, I was afraid that might get a read and find out type answer so thanks for assuring us that Rand's fate will not be open-ended for interpretation.

#### Wilson Grooms

Yep, there will be a definite confirmation by the end of what happens to him.

## Entry #10

#### Terez

From the Ogier panel:

## Entry #11

#### Question

Can you confirm that there is only one Book of Translation?

#### Maria Simons

No, I can't authoritatively confirm that.

## Entry #12

#### Terez

Can you confirm that there is only one Talisman of Growing? Because it looks like they found one in Ebou Dar.

#### Maria Simons

No, I can't confirm that. (Her expression etc. seemed to suggest that there was definitely more than one.)

#### Footnote

She was fighting a smile, specifically. I had con-head at the time; not sure why I didn't impart that detail.

Was the bubble of evil in the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue a localized effect?

#### Maria Simons

Yes.

## Entry #14

#### Terez

Maria told an interesting story about a cockroach infestation in the carriage house, which she says inspired the bubble of evil in
*The Gathering Storm*
.

## Entry #15

#### yks

Was Aviendha's usage of the crystal columns to see the future something only she could do, or something anyone could do?
