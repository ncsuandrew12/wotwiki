## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm a Special Guest at Comic-Con International in San Diego next week. My schedule is below. I'll also have a table in Artist's Alley (#II-10) where I will often hang out (and maybe play some Magic if it's feasible) when I don't have a scheduled event. Kara and Isaac from
[InkWing](http://inkwing.com/)
will be manning my table even when I'm not there, selling books and T-shirts. We're also going to have a convention exclusive hardcover (details to be announced later), so be sure to stop by.

Spotlight on Brandon Sanderson
  
Author, educator, and Comic-Con Special Guest BRANDON SANDERSON talks about his growth from a nonreader in his youth to becoming one of the most popular fantasy writers working today. Sanderson's books include his own Mistborn trilogy and his continuation of the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, which wraps up this year.
  
That's the official description; I will most likely read from a forthcoming book and take some
[audience questions.](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=800)

3:30–4:30 p.m., Room 6A
  
[Epic Fantasy War](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/07/sdcc-epic-fantasy-war)
  
We've all seen the signs: war is coming; and this winter, hobbits will learn that one should never laugh at live dragons. Join the top names in fantasy fiction as they discuss how the key to writing a real epic fantasy novel lies in the word "epic"—which doesn't just mean ambitious in scale, scope, and size. Epic fantasy helps us decipher the bigger mysteries of life. Even though there might be dragons (and magicians; horselords and warlords), every word, and every detail of the world, must resonate on a fully human plane.
