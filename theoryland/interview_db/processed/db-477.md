## Entry #1

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Peter here again. Brandon has less than a week left on his tour, the remaining stops all being on the west coast. If that's where you live, check the schedule to see when he'll be in your areaâ€”today's stop is at Vroman's in Pasadena at 7 p.m.

## Entry #2

#### Peter Ahlstrom

This week's
[Writing Excuses podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/11/15/)
covers the business of writing comics, again with Jake Black filling in for Brandon (whose we-don't-ever-discuss-it stint writing the webcomic "American Bachelors with Mecha(s)" is not nearly as relevant as Jake Black's professional experience in the industry).

In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations, Brandon talks about
[Preservation's power](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/304/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Thirty-Eight)
and
[the working mechanism of Hemalurgy](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/305/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Thirty-Nine)
. He specifically does not say anything about Adonalsium. Writers can be so cruel.
