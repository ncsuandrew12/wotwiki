## Entry #1

#### Beth Silver from Austin, TX

Aside from the Heroes of the Horn waiting around in the World of Dreams, is there any kind of afterlife in WOT? Do the Heroes get a choice when they are linked to the Horn; can they retire, or take 'ordinary life' sabbaticals?

#### Robert Jordan

In answer to the first question, yes, there is an ordinary afterlife. In answer to the second, no. You cannot decide NOT to be a Hero linked to the Wheel.

## Entry #2

#### James Koziol from Melbourne, Australia

Dear Mr. Jordan: Could you please give finally "reveal all" about who killed Asmodean at the end of the fifth book of your series? Much speculation has been bandied about, and you have said yourself you have given us enough clues, so could you put said speculation to rest? Thanks for your great series, it's been a really good read so far!

#### Robert Jordan

No. I will not put the speculation to rest! I'm rather entertained by the speculation, actually.

## Entry #3

#### Ken Wimer from Vallejo, CA

Mr. Jordan, it is a such a pleasure to converse with you like this. (Unfortunately, I am at work, so I must submit this without knowing if it will actually get answered, being 10 AM PST!) My question: It is apparent that the majority of the "World" is and has been greatly influenced, if not outright controlled by females. As we all know, females and males must work together (as in a circle) so as to defeat the Dark One. Will we be seeing more of a "work together attitude" between men and women in your future novels, or more of the "women should control all while looking down their nose at men" theme?

#### Robert Jordan

Both. I'm not certain that I have a women-looking-down-their-nose at men theme; I simply have women that consider themselves competent in and of themselves.

## Entry #4

#### Erik Hovda from Monterey, CA

I have heard of some authors writing themselves as a character in their books. Have you intentionally done that or perhaps see yourself in one of your characters? For example, Loial is taking notes so that he may write a book about Rand and the events surrounding him. Is he perhaps the "closest fit" to someone who embodies you for the series?

#### Robert Jordan

According to my wife, he is—but I don't think so.

## Entry #5

#### Dave from Mankato, Minnesota

What sort of things caused the Wheel of Time series to be so much longer than you originally anticipated? Culture description, character development, new plot developments, etc.? Or something else?

#### Robert Jordan

Not new plot, certainly. But I have been over-optimistic from the beginning about how much of the story I could get into each book. And in each case, I've found that I had to leave out things that I wanted to put into this book—or in any given book—and do them later.

## Entry #6

#### Jeff Zervos from Long Island, NY

Mr. Jordan, The Wheel Of Time series is an incredible piece of work. It is truthfully beyond anything I have ever read, including the works of Tolkien. Is there any advise you could give to an aspiring writer who is having a terrible time getting started with his story? I'm also an amateur actor and I look forward to auditioning for the part of Padan Fain one day.

#### Robert Jordan

The only advice I can give is to keep writing! But if you want to audition for the part of Padan Fain, maybe you ought to seek psychiatric help!

## Entry #7

#### Cathy from Bigfork, Montana

From the Message to the Reader at the beginning of "Snow", you seemed to have mixed feelings about the e-book format. Being from a rural area, with few bookstores, I love it. How do you feel about this new format as an author and part of the publishing industry?

#### Robert Jordan

I feel that it's a very new format, and that we have at present no idea whatsoever in what direction it is going to develop, or how widely it will be accepted. At the moment, relatively few people buy ebooks, unless they are by Stephen King, say, or if they are self-help or business. Even then, the numbers are not very big as compared to actual books on paper.

## Entry #8

#### Andrew Wilson from Toronto, Canada

Out of all the 'evil' characters you've created in the eight, now nine books of the Wheel of Time series, which character is the most dangerous to Rand?

#### Robert Jordan

Hmmm. Actually, I think the most dangerous character to Rand is Rand—but among the others, each of them has their own particular danger toward Rand.

## Entry #9

#### Lars-Remi (Kagato) from Norway

Is there any chance whatsoever that you could explain to us the full set of rules for the game 'Snakes and Foxes'? I would really like to try playing it.

#### Robert Jordan

(laughs) Not tonight! There's a fair description in one of the books, though—perhaps someday I'll put it down in print somewhere. Really, it is a child's game.

## Entry #10

#### Rune from Dragonmount

Do you have a Languages education? Where did you get the idea for the Old Tongue?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I got the idea for the Old Tongue simply because the core beginnings of this story lie 3000 years in the past—and I've never heard of a language remaining unchanged over that length of time. We could not understand the English spoken by an Englishman from 1000 years ago, and we'd have difficulty understanding him from 500 years ago, and the same holds true for a Frenchman with his language or a German with his.

#### Candice from Greenville, North Carolina

Do you ever feel under a lot of pressure to finish the books due to their popularity?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, sometimes. But I know where I'm going, I know how I want to finish it, I do not intend to speed up the pace to get there faster. In truth, the greatest pressure to finish it, I think, comes from ME. I won't really have done it until I finish it.

## Entry #12

#### MD Young from Plano, TX

In the chat before
*The Path of Daggers*
, you said that you felt three more books were needed to complete the series. Are we down to two more books now, or has the series been pushed back to another book?

#### Robert Jordan

It still sits at three more books to finish, but I've always said from the time I began using the three books that it would be AT LEAST three books—that I'd try to finish in at least three books, but I couldn't promise. I know that I couldn't possibly finish in fewer than three. If I can finish in three, I will. But that's what I'm hoping for, what I'm trying for. NOT a promise.

## Entry #13

#### Richard from Kentucky

In fantasy, the epic battle between good and evil is a physical battle. How do you personally cope with experiencing the world of WOT, and having to face the real world? Also, are you like C.S. Lewis in that you can't believe in the world you created, seeing as you made it? Thank you.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I suppose I believe in the world I made as much as any writer believes in the world he or she creates—I can see it, feel it, smell it. But I certainly have no difficulties stepping outside the world in my head into the REAL world.

## Entry #15

#### promethius from melbourne, australia

Mr. Jordan, I love your books. If a person begins to channel at an old age, e.g. Sharina, will she begin to physically look younger when she slows, or will she remain the same and pick up from there?

#### Robert Jordan

She remains the same. It's not the same as having been stilled or burnt out. She's going to have a very long life, still, just not as a youthful person.

#### Footnote

RJ said
[elsewhere](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=255#22)
that she will indeed grow younger in appearance.

## Entry #16

#### Jan from Colorado

In
*The Great Hunt*
it was mentioned that an Aes Sedai with gray hair was very old indeed. How old does an Aes Sedai typically have to be for her hair to start turning gray?

#### Robert Jordan

It varies. But usually they would expect to have grey hair by oh, 200 years of age. Some grey hair at least. Just like anyone else, some have grey hair at 150, or even 100, but that would be considered prematurely grey for an Aes Sedai.

#### Liandra from The Netherlands

I understand there would be a person in
*The Eye of the World*
, but that he was cut out or something. Who was he?

#### Robert Jordan

One of the characters who I have brought in later was a fellow named Daniell in
*The Eye of the World*
, and I brought him out because I realized he didn't have anything to do there. I reintroduced him later. At that point, he was simply taking up space.

#### Footnote

There was a detailed
[conversation with Brandon](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#11)

#### E.S. from Denver

How did Kierkegard and Sartre influence your portrayal of Bela and can you discuss how the equus/superequus dichotomy played out in the whole Asmodean murder scene?

#### Robert Jordan

(laughs) No, no, neither Sartre or Kierkegard influenced me in the slightest, nor did they influence the development of Bela. My wife thinks that they did influence the development of Bela, but I don't and I'm the one who did it, so there.

## Entry #22

#### Davidexx from Philadelphia

First, thanks for such a wonderful series. Your unsurpassed character development, such an important part of fiction writing, makes this series stand head and shoulders above similar-themed works. My question is about balance. Obviously your world is driven by pattern and balance (male and female, light and dark, etc). Why is it that as many of your major and minor characters find their complement (i.e. significant other), Rand has three, ehh, girlfriends. Is this simply because he's the "big cheese", or does this obvious imbalance represent the Wheel weaving what is necessary for the final resolution of the story?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. Sorry about that!

#### J. Hurt from Chicago

First off, I absolutely love the WOT series! What I wanted to know was when you originally started writing this series what type of research, if any, did you do to create the world and storyline you have created?

#### Robert Jordan

I started writing
*The Eye of the World*
in about 1985, I guess it was. '85 or '86. It took me four years, and I had been thinking about the things that would lead into the world of the Wheel of Time about ten years before I started writing ANYTHING.

## Entry #26

#### Ryan from New Orleans

What is the average term of office for the average Amyrlin, assuming she isn't deposed?

#### Robert Jordan

If you check the list of Amyrlins in the illustrated guide, which covers about 1000 years prior to the story, you'll find that there's quite a wide variation—up to 50 or 60 years for some, and for others, perhaps 20. In large part, it depends how old she was when she was chosen Amyrlin. That is, given that she wasn't deposed.

#### Brandon Fincher from Abilene, TX

Mr. Jordan—What rough percentage is devoted to Mat and Perrin in this book? I must admit I was disappointed Mat wasn't in
*The Path of Daggers*
more.

#### Robert Jordan

In
*The Path of Daggers*
, you have to remember that Mat had a building fall on top of him. I personally don't think that Mat lying around in a bed with bandages and splints is very entertaining, and it certainly wouldn't have done anything to advance the story. Mat does have an encounter with pink ribbons that some of you might find amusing in this book.

#### Jeremy from Long Island NY

For any of the mysteries, i.e. Moridin's identity and Asmodean's death, would you tell us where to look for clues we probably missed? Or just mention some clues that we all probably didn't see?

#### Robert Jordan

(laughs) Well, Moridin's identity is pretty much an open secret—and especially if you read
*Winter's Heart*
, I think it's increasingly clear who he is, if there was any doubt. As for the other—read and find out!

already? It doesn't go on sale until tomorrow! If it's been sold anywhere, it's a shock to me!

There are always some copies that hit the shelves too early somewhere, and it's more common in European countries and at independent bookstores in the US where the US publishers have less influence.

Hello again Mr. Jordan. Not that I'm looking forward to the end, in the sense of it being over, but what are your plans, if any, after you have finished this series? Will you continue telling stories about this world, or will you move on to new things?

#### Robert Jordan

I intend to move on to new things. I have been thinking about another fantasy series, another world, another set of cultures, for about, oh, it must be six years now it's been percolating around in the back of my head.

#### Melissa from Oregon

You've thought out your characters so clearly and their personalities are so complex. How hard was it to do this? Did it take a lot of planning ahead or did it just come naturally as you progressed into the writing?

#### Robert Jordan

There was a lot of planning ahead involved with the characters, and a lot of work—with the women characters in particular, to try to make them seem like women instead of women written by a man.

## Entry #35

#### Ethan Hayes from Colorado Springs, CO

First off, I would like to compliment you on having such a wonderful series. I have one question for you, however, about being a writer. How is it that you made yourself transition from planning the series and what was going to happen in the series and building the history, etc.; into the actual creation of the first novel? How did you know when to stop planning and to start writing?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, in this particular instance, I simply reached a point where I thought I was ready to start, and in some ways I turned out to be wrong! That's why it took four years to write
*The Eye of the World*
, I realized that there were a number of things I had to work out very far in advance from what I believed.

Mr. Jordan, does it ever frighten you that people ask you the most detailed questions about your series, kind of like Star Trek fanatics do with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy?

#### Peter Stogios from Toronto, Canada

Mr. Jordan, I loved your flashbacks to the Age of Legends in Book Four. I'm fascinated by how so many characters regard this Age as an incredible time when Aes Sedai could accomplish anything. Will we learn anything else about the Age of Legends in your upcoming books?

#### Robert Jordan

As far as what you'll find out about them, read and find out. I myself see the Age of Legends as a time that was very technological, with a technology based on the One Power. And thus, a place where things happened every day that would be considered miraculous to the people of the present time of the books. If you took someone from 500 years ago into the average house in the United States, they would think that what they were seeing had to be the product of magic, and they would believe that our world was an incredible time of wonder. They probably wouldn't see any of the warts that we see. And in the books this has happened in reverse, because the grand time is in the past.

#### Jiri Kristek from The Czech Rep.

Mr. Jordan How many hours per day do you approximately spend writing, and do you listen to music meanwhile or do you prefer the silence?

#### Robert Jordan

I usually write to classical music of various kinds, and occasionally Chinese or Japanese music. I like to listen to rock and to jazz, but I can't write to them. As for the number of hours, I try to do at least eight hours a day, six or seven days a week. When the schedule gets very hectic, that can grow to twelve hours a day seven days a week, and no time off.

#### Emily from San Jose

If you could choose any one element from your series to bring into the 'real world', what would it be? Use of the One Power?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think that I would bring anything from my world into the real world. They're all very wonderful things, I believe, but taken all in all, they make the world much too interesting for comfort. And the world we live in is awfully darned interesting, and sometimes awfully uncomfortable, as it is.

#### Robert Jordan

Mr. Jordan, do you have to reread your books often in order to remind yourself of everything you have done and still need to do, or do you just look back at notes as a basic reminder? Thanks.

Sometimes I have to look back at the books themselves, but primarily that is to make sure that I remember for example, exactly what someone said to someone else, I don't need to remind myself of the story or what has happened. I sometimes do have to check on small details.

#### Clayton from Hutchinson

First, I thoroughly enjoy the Wheel of Time series. Is there an actual form of martial arts that inspired the "sword forms", and are the forms you mention in the books part of this art or are they you own creation?

#### Robert Jordan

The sword forms described in the book are my own creation, but they are based in part on the Japanese art of the sword, and also on fencing as it developed, when it was well on its way to becoming a martial art as we define them today (when it was developing in the Renaissance).

#### Bela the Horse from Tel'aran'rhiod

What was the "extra bit" in
*The Path of Daggers*
? Was it the kiss or the bonding? Please help settle this long-standing dispute.

#### Robert Jordan

The kiss is necessary, because that's how they learned to do it, because that's how the fellow that developed it did it. The extra bit is something in the bonding, and you'll find out what in
*Winter's Heart*
. You should have gotten a clue, I think, in the scene where the bonding took place.

because you realized a number of things you hadn't yet researched. What sort of things were these, and how did you survive the more tedious aspects of world-building (i.e., lists of government official names, lists of cities and their major imports and exports, etc.)?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, the tedious bits were quite easy, and it wasn't so much a matter of research I hadn't done as things that needed to be worked out—which I thought could wait until later because they were not going to come into the books until later. But I realized once I began writing that I had to realize how those things worked and fit together NOW, because that would affect how things happened in that first book.

## Entry #60

#### John Miller from Virginia

First off thanks for joining us on the chat. To settle a dispute on our mailing list I would like to know if the
*gholam*
works the same way as Mat's medallion? Can it be killed by lightning or any such thing?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. The principle is the same, but it doesn't work in the same way as Mat's medallion.

#### Laure from Montreal, QC

You said earlier that Mat would get 'stuck' with someone and you mentioned Pink Ribbons. Eighteenth century condoms were attached with such ribbons...is it linked?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

## Entry #62

#### David from Austin

When will the Land of Madmen (as shown in the Guide) come into play, and are you considering ever making a second edition of the Guide?

#### Robert Jordan

As for when or if it will come into play, read and find out. As for another edition of the guide, I would like to do a concordance or encyclopedia when the cycle is finished, but I have no plans before that.

## Entry #63

#### Juris Koren from Sigil

When you started writing WoT—or even after the first couple of books were published—did you ever expect the public reaction that WoT has received? All the popularity and fanfare and such? Or were you just sort-of writing for you and if it was well-received, fine; if not, fine?

#### Robert Jordan

I was writing for myself. I never expected any of this.

## Entry #64

#### Dave from Wautoma, WI

Thanks for such a terrific series! I can't begin to tell you how many hours of entertainment it's provided. I was just wondering . . . provided that you get the time once in awhile, do you tend to read books inside the fantasy genre or outside or it?

#### Robert Jordan

I read more outside of the fantasy genre than inside, but I certainly do read fantasy.

## Entry #65

#### Jacob from California

First off, major compliments for sharing your beautiful creation with us. Second off, how do you come up with your characters'/cities' names? Most of the names do not sound like traditional fantasy names, did you do this conciously in order to create a work that was not like the 'norm'?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. I didn't want to simply copy what's gone before. There are some things that are reminiscent, certainly, and I can't say that every name is unlike what might be called "traditional fantasy names," but I definitely wanted names that were different.
