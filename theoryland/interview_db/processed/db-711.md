.

Since all the chapters of my abandoned novel
[*Mythwalker*](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/catalog/Warbreaker_Deleted-Scenes)

for
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
. This one talks about the process of coming up with the title for the book, with the various (and often ridiculously long) options that were considered.

*Elantris*
, the Mistborn trilogy, and
*Warbreaker*
.

I believe there are still slots available for the Magic the Gathering: Dark Ascension prerelease in West Valley this Friday. They don't count a slot as filled until you prepay, so give them
[a call](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1049/Magic-Dark-Ascension-Prerelease)
