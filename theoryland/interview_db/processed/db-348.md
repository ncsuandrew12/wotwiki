## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I'm back from my trip to Charleston. We got some really good work done and I'm excited to get back to writing. Expect that percentage bar to go up a couple more points this week. Just so that you know, I've decided to use 400k as the wordcount basis for the progress bar. I'm still not sure how long the book will be—it could be longer than that, it could be shorter—but that seemed an appropriate base line. I'll be able to tell you more as the process continues.

Look for a
*Knife of Dreams*
blog post soon, as well as some regular updates. For now, a couple of links.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

First, I'll be teaching at BYU's
[Writers for Young Readers](http://ce.byu.edu/cw/writing/)
conference this summer. They suggested I post a link, and I thought it would be a good idea. I think my session is filled up, but there might be other authors you can work with. Conferences like this one are expensive, but can really give you a leg up if you're wanting to break into publishing.

Secondly, Amazon has put up the cover art for
[Mistborn 3](http://www.amazon.com/Hero-Ages-Book-Three-Mistborn/dp/0765316897/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208169226&sr=8-4)
, which is nifty. It's still odd that the promotional Mistborn 1 and Mistborn 2 paperbacks still have no cover art posted, but whatever.

Finally, here is an amusing
[Librarian reaction to
*Alcatraz*](http://burbanklibrary.blogspot.com/2008/04/what-were-reading-alcatraz-versus-evil.html)
. If you haven't read the book, then you might want to know that this is tongue in cheek. All part of the joke. Which reminds me, I really need to get around to posting some of the Alcatraz concept art I commissioned from the talented Shawn Boyles. I keep intending to use these things on EvilLibrarians.com, which I own, but I never can find the time. Here's one he did of Alcatraz. alcatraz\_color

#### Footnote

The Alcatraz image is no longer available.
