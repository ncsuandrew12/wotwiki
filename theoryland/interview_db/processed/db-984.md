## Entry #1

#### Nesh

So I just got back from the signing. The Q&A didn't have anything Cosmere related but I asked a couple questions when I was getting my books signed.

## Entry #2

#### Nesh

So I asked whether the Teoish and Duladen could get their own magic systems.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

The answer was theoretically yes.

## Entry #4

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Well all the defense's names are based off of families he knew in Nebraska, and the evil tower is placed where his childhood house would be.
