## Entry #1

#### Question

Which world does Hoid enjoy visiting the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Scadrial almost has instant noodles. So he's very interested in Scadrial.

#### Question

Is he doing anything to push that along?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is not as involved in that as certain other forces are.

#### Question

There are forces involved in the developing instant noodles?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, oh yes.

## Entry #2

#### Question

From Shadows of Self, you just sort of name Hoid. Is he just not caring anymore, or is it just space in the book? [If anyone wants to make sense of what this question is asking, feel free. I can't understand it.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

In Alloy, he wasn't really interested. He showed up only for a wedding. By this, he's noticed something else is happening on-world, so he's come back to investigate, but he's not really relevant. You will see him taking a larger role as he becomes more interested in what's happening on-planet. His level of involvement is kind of directly tied to how interested he is in what's going on.

#### Question

Is Vasher aware of who Hoid is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher is aware of Hoid, yes. He doesn't know the whole story, but he knows that something's up with this guy.

## Entry #4

#### Question

On Sel, it seems like a lot of the magic is tied in to the location on the planet. Could you take something like Soulforging and do it on another planet, or is it just tied into Sel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is tied into Sel, and there's this distinct reason for that, and it has to do with one of the big differences between the magic there and other places that people haven't picked out of me yet.

#### Question

So is that tied into how you can get Investiture there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. It's all tied in. I’ve only made it vaguely- It's not obvious, but I think you could pick it out if you worked at it.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Are we going to get a 10th anniversary edition of Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's likely we will. The question is, how well does this one sell, and things like that, but the goal will eventually be to get a tenth anniversary, particularly for the ones where Peter didn't work with me yet, because when I hadn't hired him full time, we didn't get the Peter Copyedit, which is twenty times better than any other copy edit, so the typos were through the roof in some of the early ones, which is really why we needed the 10th anniversary copy.

#### Tags

Mistborn 10th anniversary

## Entry #6

#### Question

Is there a particular reason behind the spelling, or is it just coincidence that Kelsier and Kaladin are both K-names?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Just coincidence. Kaladin's original name was Merin, and it was a weak name that didn't work for me, so I changed it. It took me forever to find a good name for him. It comes from "paladin". Not the inworld origin, but that was the word that inspired it. It was more that I was searching for sounds, and I realized it sounded a bit like paladin, but I was okay with that. Just like Elantris sounds a little bit like Atlantis. It's not like I was purposely choosing it. I just liked the sound of it.

## Entry #7

#### Question

Does the expansion of Jaddeth’s empire have more to do with greed and hunger for power, or the innate nature of Dominion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both. The innate nature of Dominion probably c0aused the greed and hunger for power.

#### Question

What would you say percentage-wise?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, one caused the other. It definitely started with Dominion. The Skaze are pretty thirsty for power.

## Entry #10

#### Question

For Soulforging, if you rewrite the history of an item, and it took effect permanently, would there ever be a potential to have a butterfly effect, out beyond the history of the item, that might directly affect something somewhere else in the world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would be very very hard for that to ever happen, because it's like spliced DNA or something like that. It's not real. It's a Forgery. Nothing else considers it, that it did that. [That sentence is slightly unclear. Don't quote it.]. The only tricky bit would be if you have children, and you've rewritten yourself in an interesting way that’s actually changed your DNA, that... might have ramifications.

#### Question

Ever since reading Legion, I feel like Stephen Leeds might be based off of you. Is that accurate at all?

There's a little bit of me in every character, and the me that's in him is kind of the organizing crazy voices in my head.

## Entry #12

#### Question

What's the chemical definition of a metal in Mistborn? Is it the entire chunk of the periodic table defined as a metal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is technically that, but many of them are Allomantically inert. But things like cesium still count.

## Entry #13

#### Question

If sprens are pieces of the god power, and investiture is the power of the god, then can Nightblood consume spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He could theoret- Yeah, he could totally consume spren. There's not even any “theoretically” to that.

## Entry #14

#### Question

Are Cognitive elements like spren and seons only present on physical planes or worlds where Shards have been Shattered?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but it does require … alternately the shard would have to give up pieces of their power for that. But it doesn't have to be "they were Shattered by someone." Seons existed on, sorry, spren existed on Roshar before the Shattering. Not as many.

#### Question

Where are you going with the lunar allegory of Wax and Wayne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's no moon on Scadrial, and it just cracked me up that they would have these names that were a pun that they wouldn't get. I came up with Wayne's name first and then I needed a name for the straight man he played off of, and then Wax and Wayne amused me.

#### Question

Are the 16 shards finalized?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have finalized them with the reservation that I can change them when I do their adaptation if something works better. I have them all written down, but they're not canonized. I could tweak them. Once I put them in a book, they're canonized. I like to give myself a little bit of flexibility before I put them in a book.

## Entry #25

#### Question

Syl identifies herself as an honorspren.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Would Wyndle identify himself as a cultivation spren?
[Pause]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I think you could say that he would.

#### Question

By the same logic, would a voidspren follow the same naming convention, so to speak?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's the thing. Certain spren have decided that they are the most pure forms of honor, or that they are the most pure form of whatever, where all of them are kind of... Syl's got a good argument for what she is. But there are other spren that would be like "well, I'm an honorspren too, I'm just this variety of honorspren." Does that make sense? Syl's like "I'm an American!" and I'm like "I'm an Alaskan!" Yes, you're an American. I'm an American too. It's kind of similar to that. But she would be the most pure... many would view her as the purest form. Wyndle would view himself as the purest form of a cultivation spren.

No. No no no no no no. [unimportant conversation] The fourth ideal is guessable, I feel. Much more so than... Well, you probably could have guessed the third ideal as the book progressed. I think you could guess the fourth one right now, but it's going to be hard. It's not obvious, but it's =there.

## Entry #36

#### Question

Is metal a renewable resource on Scadrial, or is it going to run out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does run out.

#### Footnote

supposedly contradicts another WOB: I just got back from the Phoenix Comic on, where Brandon is a guest at, and I must say it was an honor to meet him. He read parts of Wax/Wayne 2, Legion 2, and the Taravangian interlude in WoR. There weren't a lot of cosmeric goodies, but I did get a couple interesting tidbits in relation to Mistborn: Ruin would have had to manifest to reabsorb the atium, the Well of Ascension did not come at a price to Preservation's power, and perhaps the most interesting one. Burned metals are turned into a different form, and will eventually return to the planet. The Pits of Hath sin are meant to foreshadow this.

## Entry #40

#### Question

This is more of a nitty-gritty question about Allomancy, in particular cadmium. Would it function if it were affixed to a body smaller than a planet with its own source of gravity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What do you mean by work [function]?

#### Question

Like a spacecraft. My thinking is that it could be used on long space voyages, because you’ve said that you're going to eventually progress into the Space age--

#### Brandon Sanderson

So are you asking if we can use that as cryogenics?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually give you some tools for figuring these sorts of things out in Bands of Mourning, so I'll refer you to that, because I'm dolling the physics of these things out, and since I know it's coming in January, just read that one. You'll get some more actual concrete laws and rules so you can start extrapolating.

## Entry #41

#### Question

I have to congratulate whoever did the Soonie pup ad. Effective advertising: I want one!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, lots of people have said this. It was not something we were intending to do. It would have to be more than just a little puppy, though. You'd have to be able to rip out its spikes and transform it or something. You can go get a stuffed puppy anywhere.

#### Question

But it's a stuffed TenSoon, so it's a stuffed Irish wolfhound. And you can find those in adult. You cannot find those in puppy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll think about it.

#### Question

You don't have to do the spikes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know, but people will want the spikes. You'd have to be able to take out the spikes and turn it into a blob, so it's a mistwraith on the inside and a Soonie pup on the outside.

#### Question

It'd have to be something like a backpack dog. Maybe the spikes are clasps on the outside or something.

#### Argent

Can you confirm: When Bleeder died, she only had one spike made of that new metal in her, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What does the book say?

#### Argent

It could go either way. Because it could be either one spike of the unknown metal and one regular, or just one of the unknown metal. And we're divided right now.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have heard this. I didn't intend you to get divided, but I've heard that you are, and part of me doesn't want the… One Week Later...". I want more time for the theories to come out!
[You can hear the smile in his voice :( ]

#### Argent

There are theories.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know. Let's give the theories a little more time and then I'll canonize it for you in a little bit. I didn't intend for there to be a division here, but obviously there is, and so I'm going to wait until I'm done with tour. Then you can write to us and we'll tell you exactly what's going on there.

Can somebody travel to the Spiritual Realm, the same as the Cognitive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it's a very different experience. It is possible… You may have seen people do it...

As in you're not sure, or you're being obnoxiously vague?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No...

#### Question

As in, you probably have but he's having trouble remembering it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No no no... For instance, Elend burning atium and duralumin pulled most of him into the Spiritual Realm.

#### Argent

Oh, that's what happens there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. He kind of got yanked into- You also have seen people ascend with the powers and dip into the Spiritual Realm for a little bit.

#### Argent

So, Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. But they could be on both, or either, or both at the same time. But you have seen Vin stick into the Spiritual Realm. And it happened to Sazed/Harmony...

#### Question

Oh! So is that where the gods live? Kinda?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most of the bulk of the Shard's energy of being is contained in the Spiritual Realm, yes. [edited for clarity- Original was: Most of the bulk of what the Shard's energy of being is contained on the Spiritual Realm] Except for one notable exception!

## Entry #50

#### Question

Is there a pattern to Spook's street slang?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it's a really loose one. It was based off of some rhyming slangs, some street slangs, and some things that I researched, where it would evolve day by day, and they would throw in some extraneous words just to confuse people that didn't speak it. It was also based on internet slang. There are rules, but the rules are kind of loose and free, and you can add weird words when you want to. You basically put everything in the past progressive and then you add lots of extra "to be" phrases. Then you reverse a few of your syntaxes, and that's it.

#### Question

So it's practicing a whole lot to sound improvised.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. ... Wasing the being of complicated to be. No, complicated to see. Yeah.

What's your favorite board game outside of Magic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh... I'm not a board game guy. A lot of people who play Magic don't play anything else. My brother's the board game guy. I don't really have a favorite. I'll play with him, but I'll do it for fun to hang out with my family. If I do have one, it's Sorry, because that's what my family played when I was a kid. Does Dominion count? Then that would be my favorite. I really like Dominion. Stratego's not bad.

#### Question

We were talking about Kelsier, and how he was much more powerful than most Mistborn, and how Vin was slightly more than most Mistborn [I think this was supposed to be Kelsier?]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why were Vin and Kelsier more powerful?

#### Question

I know why Kelsier, but why Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vin was not more powerful. Vin just took to it very naturally. She was highly skilled. It was very instinctive to her, but Elend was actually more powerful than she was, if you count just raw power. Vin just knew her stuff. Beyond that Vin is a rare individual that for reasons I have not explained yet, was able to draw in the mists for a little extra boost at times. And there are other characters you have seen do this.

#### Question

Why did you call it Shadows for Self?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are two answers to this. One is the kandra are kind of doing different versions of themselves. The other is that Wax is trying to decide which person he is, through this. The term "shadows of self" is actually a phrase that one of the kandra use in the first trilogy talking about this idea of changing who they are and things like that, so the phrase had import to me in-world.

#### Question

Would it be safe to assume that Kaladin is also carrying the Honorblade? Because that makes the most sense to me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which Honorblade?

#### Question

The one from Szeth.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is... He's not.

#### Question

That surprises me, because to me that would be the best- That would make the most sense.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would be sneaky of me. But that's not the case.

#### Question

So he actually has an Honorblade, since you asked which one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He took Szeth's. So he has that one. Oh! I thought you meant Taln's, I thought. He does not have Taln's. He has Szeth's.. Yes he has Szeth’s.

#### Question

I'm assuming he found that one, because that made the most sense to keep it safe

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s got Szeth’s, that is true. ... Sorry, I assumed you meant Taln's. Taln's is gone.

#### Question

Yeah. Taln's vanished off the face of the planet! I'm assuming Hoid grabbed that one, actually.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is one of the prevailing theories and not one that is unreasonable.

#### Question

Well, considering. That was the one, because you had mentioned last time you were here that you could have both, and I was like, "okay, so that means he’s got Szeth's sword."

#### Question

About Renarin's Ssurgebinding. Are [his visions] they influenced by Voidbinding instead of Surgebinding? [unclear who "they" are-possibly his visions?]

That's a RAFO.
Q: And then if they are influenced by Odium the way that Dalinar's are influenced by Honor.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO. I'm not going to talk about stuff like that! I have dropped some very blatant hints, and that is enough for me right now.

#### Argent

I asked pretty much the same thing last time, and you pointed me to a certain page. Can I tell her what the page was?

Yes. There are certain things going on with him that I feel are very blatant. He [Argent] is going to point them out to you.

#### Question

Do the Knights Radiant have a nahn? Are they within the nahn system or the dahn system at all?

The nahn and dahn system is a more recent construct. They would be at the very height of it, I would say.

#### Question

Okay. So the system hasn't been reorganized yet with Kaladin and such?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll have to watch and see what happens in the next few books. Because the culture is not used to Knights Radiant being around.

There will be several Hoid books eventually. It will be about his backstory, the main one, and then we'll have some in the present as well.

#### Question

Allomancy is of Preservation, correct?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes...

#### Question

What are Feruchemy and Hemalurgy of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hemalurgy is definitely of Ruin.

#### Question

Is it of pure Ruin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. That's a very Ruin thing. And Feruchemy is more of a blend. Though… there is more philosophy to that and human construct—like the Allomantic table—than I think I’ve made clear before.

It's pretty close, yeah. [some time later] If there's one thing in the depictions of Wax that are a little wrong, I imagine him more swarthy. Darker coloring, just a bit. He's really kind of tannish. But I like how Ben got him to look kind of ugly, which is kind of Waxish. He's not horribly ugly, but he's not a model.

#### Question

The metals that were formed from Shards, like atium and lerasium. Are they somewhat naturally occurring, like in [?] of power, or are they specifically [?]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are somewhat naturally occurring.

#### Question

[Really? Even on other Shardworlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh. They could exist somewhere else. There are some special circumstances on Scadrial, but yes. The idea is that the pools are one state of this mythological matter.

#### Question

So if you have the physical state and the liquid state, is there a less liquid state? [what does this question even mean?] Because some of that's being used.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um... Oh. Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, it's such a drop in the bucket compared to the actual Shards. So that it is a statistically insignificant amount, but it is an amount.

#### Question

So Harmony's pool, wherever it is is statistically larger than...

Yes.

If another shard just came to visit, probably not.

If they brought a spren or-

#### Brandon Sanderson

If they came and completely Invested the world, then things might start happening. But there's some special circumstances, remember. Ruin and Preservation created that planet. Specifically. And so there's some goofy things that happened because of that. For instance Roshar was not made by Honor, Cultivation, or Odium. That's one of the big differences about what's going on there.

Can Hoid safely have an MRI?

Why do you ask that?

#### Alterodent

Because if you have metal inside your body, and you have an MRI, which is magnetic, it's very bad for you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're just assuming that... That's a very clever way to try to get around a question that I have not answered and intentionally said I am not going to answer, so...

#### Alterodent

Also, tattoos. You can't have a tattoo with an MRI. The ink has little bits of metal in it.

You can't? Well, I assume there are tattoo inks that are not little bits of metal.

That's true.

If you spiked out Miles' Feruchemical gold, would he be able to burn his Allomantic reserves [read: Feruchemical reserves using Allomancy] and heal it back?

Yeah, but still having Allomancy.

Still has allomancy.

#### Question

What was your inspiration for Spook?

Spook was based off of a goofy internet friend. My friends and I had made a forum online. Just my friends and I: Dan, and all these people that were writers. And then this random kid showed up, who was 16 and British, and started writing this weird stuff. He was like our little mascot, and he became our friend. We never knew him. It was all these graduated from college guys, and there's this sixteen year old kid that says the weirdest stuff.

#### Question

Does he know [that Spook's based on him]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, he knows. I told him 'I'm basing a character off of you'. He said, 'I'd love it.' And he turns out to be very heroic, so I'm sure that he... I mean, he read them all. He was great with it.

So... He does not have an Honorblade at the end of Words of Radiance.

#### Question

If an Allomancer ate a Forged metal, what happens?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is going to be some Investiture in that Forged metal, but it's not going to be keyed the right way, so it'd be like eating a metalmind... If you're asking if the metal was Forged into a different type of metal, the Forgery will take and it will believe and... that's going to get really weird. I have not considered that. That's a “let me think about it.” [Pause] My instincts say that it's going to work like the metal it's become long enough to burn for a few minutes, and then that's going to break the Forgery, and it's going to snap out of it and become the other metal. That’s my instinct, but I’ll have to think about it further.
(on second thoughts) It's going to be really hard to burn a metal that's Invested like that. The magics don't mix real well.

#### Kurkistan

Eh, you can burn metalminds.

Yeah, you can, but it’s from the same “magic set”, right? So...

Could you Forge an entire human? What if a kandra eats that human?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, you could Forge an entire human, and the kandra can eat that human as long as the Forgery takes. The problem is, once you break the seal, they're going to change back. So that kandra would have to find a way to eat that person without breaking the Forgery. In that case it would just remain.

And Alendi saw a different one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. And originally my rules for what made a mist spirit were a little more lax than I eventually decided them to being.

#### Argent

But it still works…?

#### Argent

On Nalthis, can aluminum prevent somebody from Returning? So if you kill somebody with aluminum and leave the weapon in them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Long pause]I don't think that's going to be enough. I think that…

#### Question

Different way then?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah there are totally ways. I don’t think that that’s going to be enough. There's a difference between being inert and blocking Investiture, and actually sucking out Investiture. If you stuck Nightblood inside of a corpse; there are certain things… if you had a larkin or whatever sitting there that ingests the Investiture as it was coming in, that would prevent [Returning]. I think with aluminum you would just have somebody that comes alive with a wound, so maybe... But I think it would just heal around [the aluminum] and you'd just have a spike in you, kind of like Hemalurgy—but not like Hemalurgy. It's inert, but you know what I mean.

#### Question

Which suggests you can't actually Awaken aluminum.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It's not going to hold a charge.

I assume you can't Forge it, either.

No. In fact the unForgable metal-

There's an unForgeable metal mentioned.

If you're on Threnody and you get withered by a shade, are you better off burning Allomantic aluminum, or tapping Feruchemical gold?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(lots of laughing) [Some clarification on the question]They would both work pretty well. I would say if you burned aluminum, that would kind of have the effect that you are wanting it to have, which is the effect- negating and sucking out, so that’s probably safer. But the gold would work, too.

#### Kurkistan

So would it be fair to describe withering as a kind of cancerous Forging-

#### Question

In your mind, what would constitute a Worldhopper? Is it someone who makes a single trip between worlds (for example, the exodus from Yolen—not that it was an exodus, but a single trip), multiple trips between worlds (such as Hoid), or simply leaving a particular world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's the thing. I would call anyone who is aware that there are multiple worlds in the Cosmere and has visited more than one a Worldhopper.

#### Question

Do they actually have to have made it to a second world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think that…You’re getting at people like- I would say that they are a Worldhopper kind-of, but not fully. They’re kind of...

#### Kurkistan

The Doctor's companion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the Doctor’s companion type thing. I would define a Worldhopper as someone who has been to another world. I would call someone who has not actually been to another world “Cosmere-aware,” but not necessarily a Worldhopper.

With Stormlight, the better the gem is cut, the less Stormlight it leaks, and the longer it holds its charge. If a gem was perfectly cut, on a molecular scale, would it leak Stormlight at all?

In a theoretical flawless gem, then no it would not.

#### Alterodent

Would it actually give off light?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh... Theoretically no it would not, but it's not what you're thinking...

#### Alterodent

No no no, that’s not what I’m thinking, I figured that’s something totally different.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, actually, it probably would still give off light, because it's drawing out of the Spiritual Realm. So I’d say it still lights, but it doesn't leak. The leaking is not where the illumination is coming from. The illumination is coming from a direct... It's basically a lightbulb screwed into the Spiritual Realm.
