## Entry #1

#### Online Host

Your host for tonight is CSEmcee1 (Norma II).

Robert Jordan is a lifelong resident of Charleston, SC who served two tours of duty in Vietnam and received a degree in physics from The Citadel, the military college of South Carolina.

When a injury sidelined him from a career as a nuclear engineer for the Navy more than a dozen years ago, he became a voracious reader, and the frustration with the quality of fiction he was reading drove him to begin writing himself.

An avid history buff, Jordan is particularly interested in military history, and Charleston's past. He and his wife live in the Old Historic District of Charleston. The outdoorsman enjoys hunting, fishing, and sailing, and the indoor games of poker, chess and pool.

Why are Jordan's books so popular? Look at the phenomenon of epic fantasy itself. When Tolkien's novels burst on the scene in the '60s, the fantasy genre was virtually unheard of. But his stories of hobbits and dark evils caught on. Without question The Lord of the Rings is nothing less than amazing.

Countless readers fell in love with the chronicles of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and responded to it on a level that transcends mere entertainment. Then came Jordan. And with him, another popular cultural phenomenon—The Wheel of Time!

Lest his fans despair, he wants them to know that even when he's on the road during is current tour, he is hard at work on his seventh (yet untitled) volume of The Wheel of Time. America Online is pleased to present perhaps the most-discussed author on the Internet, Robert Jordan!

## Entry #2

#### CSEmcee1

Good evening and welcome to the Globe, Mr. Jordan!

#### Robert Jordan

Good evening and thank you for having me!

#### CSEmcee1

We have some questions from the audience if you are ready!

## Entry #3

#### Question

How many books will the Wheel of Time series be?

#### Robert Jordan

As many as it takes to reach the last scene, which has been in my head since the very beginning. And not a book more. Sorry.

## Entry #4

#### Question

Whats it like to write a protagonist who frankly is going batty? How do you balance likeability with fading competence?

#### Robert Jordan

I just try to do it in the book the way I do it in real life.

Mr. Jordan, are there any fantasy writers, beside yourself, that interest you?

It's a moderately long list, but ... Tad Williams, Holdstock, Ray Feist, Janny Wurts, Barry Hughart, C. S. Friedman, and really that's just the beginning, the ones that come off the top of my head.

What was the primary driving force behind your world (other than making lots of money)?

The driving force was creating a world populated by cultures that seemed real, but alienâ€“alien as in other.

#### Question

What went on with Egwene, Mat and Fain in the dungeon
*The Great Hunt*

#### Question

Interesting parallels between your life and Heinlein, who also turned to writing after illness forced him from a military career. Mr. Jordan, how did you become interested in writing?

#### Robert Jordan

I was reading Mark Twain. I was five years old, and I wanted to make stories like that.

#### Question

Who if any are Mr. Jordan's favorite authors?

#### Robert Jordan

Tad Williams, Robert Holdstock, Ray Feist, Janny Wurts, C. S. Friedman, Barry Hughart, and we'll cut it off there before it gets too long. I assume the last question meant in fantasy, because my favorite authors overall are Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austin. Austen. Sorry, Jane.

How do Wise Ones get

What was your inspiration for this series? Anything specific?

For First Cause: I suppose the question of what it would really be like to be tapped on the shoulder and told that you were born to be the savior of mankind. Beyond that, two or three hundred things.

#### Question

I lived in Charleston during Hugo—has that influenced you or the story in any way?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think your presence influenced me at all! As for the storm, it didn't influence me either, except that I have noticed sometimes, when the wind gets high, I climb up on the roof for no particular reason.

#### Question

I was wondering if you could comment on some of the clues that Randland (as we call it) seems to be written as a future earth.

#### Robert Jordan

Time is a wheel. If you look in one direction, you are looking at the past. If you just turn around and look in the other direction, you are looking at the future. The books are set in our future and in our past, depending on which way you look.

#### Question

Mr. Jordan, your work is purely exceptional. Do you do much research once you begin writing? What type of things do you research?

Yes, because I need to research things like the details of exactly how a blacksmith works. For example.

The very first notion came to me nearly twenty years ago; I spent ten or twelve years mulling it over, told my then-publisher about it, and he offered me a contract.

Why is Myrelle so heartless? She nearly let Lan die. Why?

I'm sorry. How long after publishing

I never expected anything like this, and I really don't know how long it took me to realize that the books were very popular. It rather crept up on me.
