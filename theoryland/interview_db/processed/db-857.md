## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

This post will have quite a few random tidbits. First off, my friend Tracy Hickman wrote to tell me about a holiday serial novel he and Laura are putting up. If you

Irene Gallo at Tor.com posted a picture of
[the first printed copy of
*A Memory of Light*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/11/its-gettin-real-a-memory-of-light)
. This is called an F&G (folded and gathered pages). The book comes out next month!

Most of my
*A Memory of Light*
book signing tour has been announced and posted on my events page. There are still a couple of Canadian dates to be added, but Tor should have those finalized soon. If you want email reminders when I'm near you, tell me your city
[at this link](http://brandonsanderson.com/contact/?topic=9)
. I also have a handful of events in December, including this week in West Jordan.

Tor.com also put up
[a video](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/11/brandon-sanderson-patrick-rothfuss-and-tom-doherty-talk-a-memory-of-light)
where Harriet McDougal, Tom Doherty, Jason Denzel, Pat Rothfuss, and I talk about
*A Memory of Light*
. Check it out.

This is the last week for the
*A Memory of Light*
audiobook/iphone case promotion that I
[talked about a few weeks ago](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1122/)
. If you buy the CD version of the audiobook, you can get a free iPhone 4/4S case. Details are

.

Moses Siregar III has
[an interview with Jason Denzel](http://www.adventuresinscifipublishing.com/2012/12/aisfp-180-jason-denzel/)
on the Adventures in Sci-Fi Publishing podcast. It talks a lot about
*A Memory of Light*
, as well as other things Jason is involved in.

Here are two more cool pieces of fan art. The second one is a painting that the artist Megan brought to show me at my signing in Idaho Falls. Thanks!

Finally, the blog The Ranting Dragon is having a "cover battle" that I thought was pretty cool. You can vote for which cover art/design you like best, and the top vote-getters will face off against each other for . . . supreme domination or something. The competition is quite stiff, but the ebook cover for
*The Emperor's Soul*
(art by Alexander Nanitchkov, design by Isaac Stewart) is in the
[first round](http://www.rantingdragon.com/the-cover-battle-of-2012-phase-1-round-1/)
. I love this art and the design, so I'm happy to see it nominated! You can vote for whichever cover you like, and you can also write in other options. For an explanation of the different rounds see
[here](http://www.rantingdragon.com/cover-battle-of-2012-help-us-find-the-years-best-cover/)
