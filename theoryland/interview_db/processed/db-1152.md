## Entry #1

#### Question

[paraphrased] I have Aspergers, and when I read Bands of Mourning, for the first time I could really identify with a character [Steris]. What kind of research did you do when writing her?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have several people in my life who have Aspergers, specifically, and they were a huge resource, as you might imagine. One of the things I like to do in my fiction is to try and get people who are heroic who have different types of psychology than what you normally see in heroes. The more I’ve lived in life, the more I realize that we all are really distinctive in our own way and our psychology all works differently. And yet we see a lot of heroes who have the same brain chemistry, it seems, and that’s always felt really weird to me. So one of my mandates has been to do that [vary characters’ psychology.]

So what kind of research did I do? When I was in college, one of my favorite things to do was sneak into classes I wasn’t signed up for. And the psychology classes were my favorite. And this friend—this is coincidental—who wanted to be a chef actually got a psychology major. His parents were like “You should do something useful with your life,” so he got a psychology major. He ended up going to med school; he didn’t become a chef. He went to med school and he likes that too. [Note: Brandon talked about this friend during the first part of the signing.] I would sneak into his classes, and they were so useful as a writer. Just to look at the different [neuro]types and to start to see personality not as… We like to look at a lot of things as normal or abnormal, and that’s not the way it is. Everyone’s personality is on a spectrum, and what is normal and what is abnormal is completely a matter of perspective. Where you stand on this line. It’s trying to make a value judgment that shouldn’t really exist. So it’s coming to see personality as these swaths of interesting color is what the psychology classes taught me.

I did do some specific research for Steris, and then I looked and I interviewed people as well.

I’m glad that you picked up on it without me ever having to say who she was and things like that. That’s when I really feel like I’ve nailed something, when you can look at in and say, “Yeah, this is who this person is,” instead of someone pointing from the outside and saying who this person is or what they are.

## Entry #2

#### Question

I listen to your podcast, Writing Excuses, and you’ve been this year breaking down stories into different parts. Was Bands of Mourning was your attempt to write a pulp novel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Actually, all of the Wax and Wayne books are a harkening back to classic serials of old novels. It’s interesting looking back at that. I kind of pitched those books to myself as Mistborn the television show, or the action serial. The other ones were the epic fantasy, these were the action serials, and I did try to kind of vary the genre. The first one is straight up detective novel, the second one’s a psychological thriller, and the third one is classic serial adventure story. That was very intentional. It was me trying to take different tones and mash them up with different stories and see what comes out.

## Entry #3

#### Question

[paraphrased] Your magic systems are all very detailed and internally consistent. To what extent do you come up with the world and then write a story within it, versus building the world to fit the story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The answer is, “Yes.” Which is one of those unsatisfying authorly answers. It depends on the story. Like for instance with the Wax and Wayne books, I already had the world built, so in that I’m building a story around a setting that already existed. With the Reckoners, what happened is I had the idea for people who gained superpowers all going evil, and that concept spun me into building a story about it. So that’s more of an idea that spins a story rather than a setting. Sometimes I’ve had a character I’ve really wanted to tell a story about, like Raoden or something like this, and then I build magic to match. It happens all different ways, and really it’s a give and a take. Once you start with a character, you start building a story around them, and then you stop and you work on the magic for a while, then you go back to the character and then you go back to the magic and then you go to the setting and then you go to the plot. As you build an outline you weave all these things together. You’re not just spending time on one till it’s done and then the next until it’s done. It’s happened all different ways for me.

Do you have any ideas for characters in different stories meeting each other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I do. You’ll see a bunch of that. And if you haven’t seen the little behind-the-scenes Mistborn novella, Secret History, which is ebook only right now. The print edition will come out in the fall. That involves characters from different stories meeting each other.

## Entry #6

#### Question

As a writer who’s written a lot, do you still struggle with some aspects of writing, like your punctuation still sucks or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My biggest weakness as a writer is repeating words and phrases, which is a very common thing for writers to have. There are people like Pat Rothfuss who don’t have this problem. Because they slave over every sentence. For years. [audience laughs] You know I love him.
The way I deal with it is to highlight the ones I struggle with a lot, and have my assistant look for them. Then do a search and replace in Microsoft Word for the word but with brackets around it, so it leaves the same word it just brackets it so I can decide, do I really want that word, or did I just use it because that’s what I always use.
The other big thing as a writer is I still don’t like revision. I want to be writing a new story, not revising an old one. Fortunately, this is a battle revision won like twenty years ago. More like fifteen. But I’ve gotten used to how I have to do it. When is the book done, and the number of drafts it requires. So I do it, even though, you know…

#### Tags

Brandon on writing

## Entry #7

#### Question

With as many novels as you’ve written, do you have an assistant or a system you use to remember everything?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I do. What I use is a wiki. I use a personal wiki, just like Wikipedia. I use an open-source software called wikidpad. I have someone whose job it is to read my books after I write them, go make all of those notes into the wiki with page references so I can look them all up in the book. They have a very fun yet tedious job.

## Entry #8

#### Question

What level of completion do you write your novels to before you send them to your editor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here’s a quick look at my drafting process:
Draft one, hopefully no one ever sees. I’m a momentum writer. A lot of writers are like this. I can’t stop in the middle and revise unless something is really broken. If there’s something I want to change, I just keep going and try it out for the next chapter. So if I decide I needed another character here, I will just write them in and everyone will act like they’ve always been there. I’ll try it out for a chapter. If it works, I’ll keep going that way, and if it doesn’t, I’ll cut them out and try something different. So first drafts can be really weird. “Am I supposed to know this person everyone else knows? Have I forgotten who this was?” And things like that. Characters just vanish, and I’ll leave out the foreshadowing—foreshadowing is really easy to add in later. Things like this.
Second draft is to fix all of that stuff. I can sometimes send that off, but what I really like to send off is the third draft, which is the first polished. Where for the first time I try to make it pretty, or at least not cringe-worthy. So that’s what I send to an editor. That’s also what I send to alpha readers, which is my writing group, my agent, my friends and family and things like that.
Once that gets back, I do a bunch of revisions until it’s good, and then we get beta readers, which are usually community beta readers. If you want to be a beta reader, I’m not the person to convince, Peter is. He’s my editorial assistant. He’s the one who picks the betas, and they do a bunch of reads, and I do a bunch of drafts based on what they say, and then I go to proofreaders.

#### Question

[Note: This question was asked by a young boy sitting near the front.] So for the Stormlight Archive series–

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Stormlight Archive? How old are you? [audience laughter]

#### Question

Nine?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nine? And you’re reading the Stormlight Archive? [loud cheering]

#### Question

So the character Lift, with her powers, why does she only have to eat food instead of sucking in stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So Lift is a really weird one. She visited the Old Magic and asked something very strange, and the Old Magic didn’t know how to treat that, and so answered with something equally strange. So you will actually see what happened with Lift and things like that, but suffice it to say some really weird things are going on.

## Entry #10

#### Question

I wanted to say that I admire that your characters are people first, and not gender first. But I wanted to ask you, does anyone call you Branderson?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it is starting to catch on. I don’t know if it would be my first choice, but I will accept Branderson as opposed to… if people called me BS.

## Entry #12

#### Question

With all the characters that you design, and you just said how you put a character in and see if it works, are there any characters that you keep on a backlog and try to mix and see if they fit?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Totally. What I have is this notes file, literally called “Cool stuff that I need to use sometime.” And it’s like when I see something in the news or I meet a person and say, “I need to use that someday.” It can be years before I end up sticking them in. There’s a cool example of something like this that I finally managed to stick in years later. It happens all the time. I’ll try to think of it, so when you come through the line ask me and I’ll try to remember.

#### Tags

Brandon on brainstorming

## Entry #13

#### Question

In the Wax and Wayne series, how do you come up with all of Wayne’s little wisecracks?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So here’s the deal. It’s kinda hard to write people who are more clever than you are. It’s one of the tricks you have to learn as a writer. The big difference, they do it off the cuff in the moment, and you can spend a week or two trying to find the perfect thing to say, and that’s really how it goes. Oftentimes the characters who are more humorous, like Wayne’s a great example. It’s very natural how he says things; it can take me weeks to come up with like a couple of lines of dialogue for Wayne, where other things get written very quickly.
My favorite Wayneisms are when I can have him use a word that looks–when you’re reading along you assume it’s a word, but then you go back and you’re like, “Wait a minute. Did he actually say defecation of character?” Or something like that. So you don’t even notice on the first read through. The things that a copy editor’s like, “You used the wrong word here,” those are my favorite Wayneisms. Those take forever.

Who was your favorite Mistborn character to write? Personally I hated Elend and Vin but I loved Zane.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You hated Elend and Vin and you loved Zane… Um. I–I’d probably stay away from you. [more laughter] But who’s my favorite? Picking a favorite character is almost impossible. It’s whoever you’re writing at the moment. But I kind of have a personal connection with Sazed, so I’ll say Sazed.

#### Question

What happened with Abraham’s court marshal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, that is backstory that is also a RAFO. Why Abraham was there is not something that he likes to talk about. It’s not that he’s shy, but at the same time it’s not something that he easily talks about, so I will not talk about it. I will let him someday, perhaps, talk about it.

#### Question

With the changes that happened to all the cities in the Reckoners—like we know there was a big war in Portland—did you have anything specific that happened in Seattle?

## Entry #23

#### Question

What kind of Epic is Mizzy?

## Entry #25

#### Question

We were wondering who would win in a fight, a Mistborn or a Windrunner.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would really depend on the situation. I would say the Windrunner would win on a battlefield and the Mistborn will when at sneaking around and slitting people’s throats.

## Entry #26

#### Question

So I just finished The Bands of Mourning, which was my favorite out of that series. Did you know when you were writing Alloy of Law how you were going to link this to the original, with the kandra, the bands of the Lord Ruler...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah the kandra were seeded, MeLaan you can go and look back in the original three. Like I’m going to use her in the next series, for sure. Now what I usually do is when I’m starting a series, and I did this for this one, is I will write the first book in the series. So I did this with Steelheart, I did this with the original Mistborn, I did this with Alloy of Law. I write the first book, I sit down, and say “Okay, what worked about that, what can I expand upon” and then I outline the series with those characters and then go back and revise the first one to match and then I release the first one. Does that make sense?

#### Question

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So not everything do I know writing the first one but by the time I’m through the revisions I usually do.

#### Question

Vasher/Zahel is a Returned, which means he needs Breath to live. But Breath doesn’t exist--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right.

#### Question

--on Roshar. Does he use St--

#### Brandon Sanderson

He uses Stormlight. One of the reasons-- In fact one of the primary reasons he’s on Roshar is because Stormlight is so much easier to come by than Breath. And in fact researching about things like this is one of the reasons he discovered Roshar in the first place.

#### Question

So it’s the same reason why Night-- the sword…

#### Question

For all the spren, like the honorspren and the liespren, I’ve noticed that all of the characters, the honorspren have been girls and all the liespren have been boys. Is that just ‘cause all the people who attract liespren are girls and all the other people--

#### Brandon Sanderson

So it’s not a one to one ratio of people who are more likely to attract a spren of the opposite gender.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah I’ll delve into it eventually in the books. Maybe just obliquely, but there is a reason for it.

#### Question

I kind of envision the Old Magic working a little bit like Hemalurgy, where some-- takes a part of the Physical DNA of the person and transmutes it onto the Cognitive DNA because everything seems to be a Cognitive shift for the person, am I thinking along the right lines?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are thinking along very-- Yes you are thinking along the right lines. I won’t tell you exactly but you are thinking along the right lines.

#### Question

And then the curse Kelek’s Breath, is that a clue as to the origin of some of the Heralds?

Erm… Explain why you think it might be.

#### Question

Have we ever seen the Physical embodiment of either Odium or Cultivation? Similar to what we saw with Ruin chasing...Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So \*pause\* physical embodiment is kind of hard thing to define with Shards because you could argue that everything is a physical embodiment of them, does that make sense?

#### Question

Yes. I mean more a physical form that the uses share--

Oh okay, okay. So have you ever seen Odium’s? I don’t believe you’ve seen Odium’s.

#### Question

Well you answered my question about Allomancers being able to burn metals in other realms--

#### Question

--is that because the Shards are sort of… My impression from the book was that the Shards were--in the Mistborn books--specifically in that area but is it because the universe is formed across all of them that that is why the metals--

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, most of the magics are not region-dependent, because the Spiritual Realm-- in the Spiritual Realm space doesn’t exist. All things are the same distance from one another.

#### Question

Okay, so when Kelsier is in the-- Which Realm is he in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s in the Cognitive Realm.

#### Question

Is he seeing people from other worlds or is he--

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he meets some people who are traveling but Cognitive Realm is location dependent. He is on the Cognitive Realm on Scadrial and the people he runs into there-- until he kind of travels off into space, which is where he finds the fortress.

#### Question

So even though he’s tied to Scadrial could he go to the Cognitive Realm of other worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He would have trouble getting to another planet, being a Cognitive shadow like he was.

#### Question

So is there some particular thing that somebody would need to have to be able to move between the realms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A body is helpful.

That does make sense.

#### Brandon Sanderson

--who want something, does that make sense? Like it isn’t really-- it is a story, but it's not a real story, it’s got weird narrative and things to it. It is there for those who really want to know.

#### Question

And I’m one of those people, I just have to wonder if you had no idea you’d be really confused through at least the first half.

Even those who claim heirship may not have any more blood than a lot of other people. I think this is one where fans have latched onto it a little too strongly and I need to let them know they can back off, there’s not a big secret for them to be hunting.

#### Question

Speaking of intents, Investiture, and what Shards can see, hypothetically if Odium were to go to Scadrial would some things not be visible to him, like, say, metal?

## Entry #59

#### Question

It feels like Roshar is-- has an essence, where it’s like a prism, you can see all the rest of them, due to the nature of the Cognitive Realm and the spren’s ideas, Cognitive things coming to light. Have I spent too much time looking at the Shard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, you are on the right path. Of all the things you noted, that one is the one that is perhaps the most important.

#### Question

The prism idea.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The idea that Roshar is special and a key on Shadesmar.

#### Question

In Secret History we learned a little about how the Cognitive Realm...could bleed into the Physical if the person was slightly broken.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Broken as Kelsier’s term is not right, and he realizes that over the course of the book, but yeah.

#### Question

My thoughts were on Wayne, so he seems to notice--and it might just be kleptomania--a connection between items that makes him feel as if he’s not stealing, just trading things for equal value. And I’m wondering if he’s noticing something in the Cognitive-- in one of the other Realms that is actually noteworthy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s just goofy.

#### Question

In Bands of Mourning we saw the medallions that can give people Connection to the area that they are in. Two thoughts on that. One… if a person were to get a connection to one of the areas from Elantris would they be able to gain the powers from the area?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah that’s a good question, it’s not that easy. But it is an excellent question.

#### Question

And if there was an area where the primary language was sign language, would a person gain the ability to speak sign language to the people present by using that connection?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It is definitely related to the Cognitive Realm and how people are thinking about language.

What happens when you Lash water, or a body of water?

Would it have a gravity well going on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah it would have a gravity well, it think-- yeah. You are the first person to ask about that, I don’t think even my assistant has asked about that. So that’s your tentative answer until I think about it some more, but I think it would.

Yeah, they’re only tangential in the other books. I think one of them has only shown up on screen once. The other one’s shown up a couple of times but mostly in certain annotations and things like that. In the books, like on the maps.

#### Question

Have you ever considered doing a pronunciation guide for your characters?

I should do that, shouldn’t I?

The thing about that is I’m kind of of the philosophy that however you do it in your head is the right version in your version of the story. Because the characters won’t look the same to everyone. Everyone imagines them differently, might as well say the names differently...

Not heal them up but--

#### Question

The intent was that he would Preserve them, right? So my theory is that Snapping, when they’re getting physically damaged their cracks are wider and wider and that it ends up Preservation, if they have a good Connection with Preservation or whatever randomly comes in those cracks. Am I anywhere along the right track?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, so when you are Compounding--

#### Question

Can you explain, I’m unclear on the Compounding.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Compounding is a way to hack the magic system so you can get a Feruchemical attribute out of-- basically powering Feruchemy with Allomancy. If that makes sense.

#### Question

So you’re not actually burning the metalmind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kind of? There’s a big explanation on Reddit, if you send me an email I can link you to it, that steps you through exactly, easier than explaining it here.

#### Question

So nicrosil. Wax couldn’t use a blank gold metalmind because he’s not a gold ferring, why can he use a blank nicrosil metalmind?

So this will all come out eventually but the idea is there are certain ways to connect yourself to the magic, to hack the magic and make it think you have the Spiritual DNA that you don’t actually have. And this is one of the ways.
