## Entry #1

#### Minorja

This past weekend the
[Addlestone Library](http://www.cofc.edu/library/)
at The College of Charleston had the pleasure of hosting over 300 WoT fans for a Q&A and book signing for
*A Memory of Light*
, the final book of The Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan. We were fortunate to have Harriet McDougal, Brandon Sanderson, Maria Simons, and Alan Romanczuk present for this special event in James Oliver Rigney Jr.'s hometown of Charleston, South Carolina.

were on site selling t-shirts, playing cards, and posters, Barnes and Noble set up a small table and sold hardcover copies of
*A Memory of Light*
,
*The Gathering Storm*
, and
*Towers of Midnight*
, and in the rotunda on the first floor, Special Collections had a small display case of materials from the recently donated James O. Rigney Jr. papers as part of a larger display on the third floor. Also on display were reproductions of Rand's red coat, an Asha'man coat with a Wheel of Time sword pin, and an Aiel warrior complete with spear and shield provided by Museum Replicas. Hunter Wentworth was on hand showing portions of
[The Wit of the Staircase](http://wots.spiralent.com/wots/The_Wit_of_the_Staircase.html)
, his documentary on the life of Robert Jordan, as well as filming the event for inclusion in the final cut of his movie. The Memory Keepers were also present handing out numbered tickets for people wanting books signed, answering questions, and getting to spend a little personal time with Harriet and Brandon, Maria, and Alan before the signing.
