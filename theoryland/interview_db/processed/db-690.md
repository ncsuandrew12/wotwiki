## Entry #1

#### Czanos

Would anything interesting happen if an Allomancer Burned a Hemalurgic spike, or a Feruchemist Tapped one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Er, well, it’s possible. But you’d have to be burning a Hemalurgic spike that killed you and took your power... Just like you can’t gain anything by burning a metalmind unless you infused it yourself.

## Entry #2

#### ecurbmp

Any chance of an
*Elantris*
or
*Warbreaker*
revisit down the road, or are you done with those worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I hope to do a 10th anniversary edition of
*Elantris*
(revised and updated) in 2015, with a sequel the same year.

## Entry #3

#### Meeeeech

Who would win this three way fight? Vin vs. Vasher vs. Lan? I vote Vin...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on how much metal Vin has, how many Breaths Vasher has, and if Lan can get the jump on them. Probably Vin, though Rand would blow her out of the water.

#### MEEEEECH

P.S. Vin would lure Rand to Far Madding and take him down.

## Entry #4

#### kikastrophe

Any idea how many books will be in the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tor asked me not to lock myself into a length. But I plotted
*Kings*
at 10 books.

#### Alphashard

It is difficult to think of questions that don't deal with the plot! Will there be romance in
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Two of them, actually.

## Entry #6

#### Theodor89

What tone will
*The Way of Kings*
have? Darker or lighter then your previous work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My goal is to blend some of the wit in
*Warbreaker*
with darker edge of Mistborn. It certainly won’t be lighter. But there should be moments when you laugh. The greatest authors out there—RJ and Martin come to mind—can do both at the same time.

## Entry #7

#### HalBrandenburg

Can you reveal anything about the setting in
*Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The setting with be the most unique I’ve done. Entirely new ecology. The world is hit by a huge hurricane every few days. Everything has evolved to deal with that. There is no soil, just rock, and even plants have thick shells they can withdraw into.

## Entry #8

#### kikastrophe

So, is
*Kings*
in any way like your other books? Shall we expect an unexpected twist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Kings*
is like my books in some ways. But in order to be grand as a series, it had to start—oddly—more humbly. Yes, there are twists. I wrote it so that the epilogue redefines the entire book and series. Each of the four viewpoints has an epilogue. Much as RJ had huge prologues, this series will have huge epilogues. Those epilogues, like the
*Elantris*
first lines, are intended to be ‘BANG’ moments.

## Entry #10

#### kqrpnb

Brandon, how do you think
*The Way of Kings*
will read as a complete set with your voice in the last books? Did you plan ahead for that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Short answer is yes. We’ll see if I can pull it off. Original plans for my series was for a 36 book arc. I thought that would intimidate readers. But the secret answer is this: People ask for an
*Elantris*
sequel. There is one. It is called Mistborn.

Snake or the Fox?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Fox. They look cooler.

#### BANVARD

All my gold on the Fox beating the game for only a
*ta'veren*

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Maybe the answer should have been “Fox or Snake? Neither. Raven.”

How goes loverboy's Min/[Elayne]/Aviendha thingee? And which girl would you go with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s interesting, as could be expected. I’d pick Min for me, but Aviendha for Rand. Know that RJ was very clear on how that whole thing was to end up. So no guesswork by me. (whew).

#### kqrpnb

Brandon, how do you think WoT will read as a complete set with your voice in the last books? Did you plan ahead for that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I tried very hard. The characters should read right, the plot should read right. I think it will read cohesive. These books will not go off on random tangents. In fact, I’m hoping that the narrative will feel like a shift back toward 4/5/6, which are my favorite WoT books.

## Entry #15

#### chrisoubre

Any talks of writing other novels based on Robert Jordan's world: The Age of Legends, the 4th Age...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RJ was very uncomfortable with the idea of people writing in his world. I want to respect that. You might see the Outriggers or the two prequels he planned to write. But no Age of Legends or Hawkwing. At least, that has been my suggestion to Harriet. It is her call.

#### Graendal

Yes! Please do what you can to get the prequels or outriggers published once you've finished writing
*A Memory of Light*

Will there be an Intro (explanation) at
*The Gathering Storm*

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wrote a foreword for the book explaining my involvement and the three book split. We were going to have Harriet do it, but the time grew tight, so I did it and had her revise it.

## Entry #18

#### joshuapatrao

Can you offer us anything at all on the status of
*The Eye of the World*
movie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don’t have much time to keep an eye (no pun intended) on the movie too closely. The producer was at JordanCon, though, and I was put at ease somewhat by speaking with him. As far as I know, it’s still in preproduction an in the scriptwriting stage. When they have a script, I’ll ask if I can read it. Maria, RJ’s assistant, is in charge of that. I’ve got my hands full writing the books!

## Entry #19

#### Banvard

Was there any character you disliked writing within the Wheel of Time universe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As an author, you get very good at being inside someone’s head. And so it’s hard to dislike writing anyone. That said, there’s a certain Cadsuane scene that—when I read the notes—I didn’t look forward to.

It would be almost as hard to let someone else do it as it would be to let them do a Mistborn book. But Harriet and Tor seem more interested in the Outriggers right now. We’ll see.

#### Graendal

How do you feel about the degeneration of Rand and Egwene's relationship? Could Amyrlin and Dragon work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think it was one of the best things RJ did. It played with our expectations in a great way. And I think Rand has his hands plenty full right now without adding Egwene back in. They have gone different directions in life. It was quite well done, though sad.

#### jeremy208

Can we expect any short stories set in the
*Warbreaker*
world anytime soon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Short stories in
*Warbreaker*
world are unlikely. I’m working on some Mistborn ones, though. If I were going to do more
*Warbreaker*
, I’d just write the sequel,
*Nightblood*
.

## Entry #24

#### Graendal

A question that's been on my mind for a while. If Returned can't have children, how are Siri and Vivenna descended from one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excellent question. One I have to RAFO. When I was writing
*Warbreaker*
, I was planning on two books. I seeded two questions to be answered in the next book. One was the origin of the royal family. The second was how Vasher was able to survive while hiding his divine Breath. I will answer these questions. Eventually. (It has to do with restoring Breath and life to the child while still in the womb.).

#### Graendal

Did you ever notice how similar Graendal and Blushweaver are in personality?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn’t until I started work on the WoT book. I wrote
*Warbreaker*
years before I was offered the WoT. I noticed and laughed. RJ’s books are dug pretty deeply into my subconscious. I think they’re very different as characters, but Graendal was obviously an influence on Blushweaver.

What first gave you the idea for
*Warbreaker*
? What was your first inspiration for it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Warbreaker*
came from a lot of sources. Siri and Vivenna were side characters in a book I never finished. Vasher came from the line that starts the book. No space to post it here, but give it a read. Nightblood came because...well, I just wanted to have a talking sword.

I was wondering why you chose to capitalize the "b" & the "c" in BioChromatic.

Why didn't Vin know the Atium bead Zane gave her wasn't real? Cant she sense how big reserves are?

Atium reserves always look bigger than they are to an allomancer. It burns so quickly. She just didn’t have enough experience with atium to realize she’d been duped.

## Entry #33

#### mnehring

How did you come up with what metal would give what powers in Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The metals just worked out right. [later] I see I misunderstood. The assignment of metals to powers was done mostly randomly. I started by trying to mix and match colors and hues, but that ended up not working. I also originally wanted the physical to be more common, and then move toward less common with mental and others. Hence, iron is physical, Gold is mental, [sic] Atium is temporal. The mentals don’t quite fit this, though.

Any plans for a kindle

version? Is
*The Way of Kings*
slated for 2010 along with WoT book 2? Now that you've revised WoK, do you think you'll release two books next year (WoT and
*The Way of Kings*
)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, if we can get Amazon to pay attention. (Grr.) And yes, two books next year.
*The Way of Kings*
and WoT13. 2011 will probably have just one, though. I don’t know if I’ll be able to write the
*Way of Kings*
sequel in time.

#### rrjr010

Would you be willing to take bribes to start
*Nightblood*
before finishing WoT!?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Heh.
*Nightblood*
will happen someday. Bribes of cookies or Magic Cards at signings might help. More seriously, I do intend to do this—and post it online as I write it—but it probably won’t be for a few years.

#### rrjr010

Then you shall have both when you come here this winter. Help turn a few years into six months, right?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

lol. Well, it can’t hurt. But I DO have a lot on my plate... We’ll see. I want an
*Elantris*
sequel out for 2015.

#### rrjr010

Wow, an
*Elantris*
sequel would be awesome too. Where would it fit chronologically after the end of
*Elantris*
?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

*Elantris*
direct sequel would be 10 years later and use Kiin’s children as viewpoint characters living in Fjorden.

Can Hoid travel through worlds? Or, in other words, are all of your "Hoids" one person?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2009-07-08)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/2537635625)

Well, "Hoid" the name is an alias that a certain person is using, and he stole it from someone else. But the person named Hoid in
*Elantris*
, Mistborn, and
*Warbreaker*
are all the same individual. For the record, this is not a "name cameo." This is, indeed, the very same person.

#### Anusien

Why did Lord Ruler not destroy the logbook knowing what trouble Ruin could cause with it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A few reasons. First, Ruin had his fingers in the Lord Ruler’s soul by then already. Subtle things are easier to influence. He played off the Lord Ruler’s natural nostalgia and desire to hold onto something so important to his past.

## Entry #44

#### jamesgubera

Where do you get your inspiration to create new worlds & characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Inspiration comes from all over. Often things I see. Color magic in
*Warbreaker*
came from watching b/w movies. The mist in Mistborn came from driving through a foggy night at 70mph. Sazed came from a Buddhist monk I met in Korea. Sarene came from a friend, Annie, who complained that she was too tall and too smart for men to want to date. If you want more, send me an email and ask for my “Ideas” essay. @PeterAhlstrom will send it to you.

Are there any characters in your books who you actually DON'T like?

Does Cadsuane count? (J/K. I love you Cads. Really, don’t beat me up.) I have characters that didn’t bloom like I wanted. Parlin in
*Warbreaker*
still itches at me. Could have been done better. I always wished I could give Ham more time in Mistborn. But I can’t think of anyone I don’t like. When I write as someone, as oily as they are, I see life as them.

## Entry #51

#### mossjon

Loving
*Warbreaker*
! How do you write women characters so well?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A mixture of helpful women friends and a lot of early failures. I’ve found the biggest problem with writing the opposite gender comes when you add them simply be a love interest. Nobody is just a love interest in their own minds. Make them a character first, a plot device second.

#### MOSSJON

Even
*Elantris*
had a great woman character. So you must be hiding the early failures. And that is why/how you succeed so well. Kudos!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Early failures were in the books that didn’t get published. (
*White Sand*
’s female lead was cringe-worthy.)

#### joshuapatrao

Do you read Stephen King? Also, which fantasy tomes would you absolutely recommend reading?

#### Brandon Sanderson

King is amazing. Truly a brilliant writer. If anyone hasn’t read, try
*The Stand*
or a short story collection. I suggest
*Name of the Wind*
,
*Dragonsbane*
, or anything by Pratchett. Particualrly
*The Truth*
. I like Jordan (duh) McCaffrey and Rawn a lot too. Williams’s
*Sorrow and Thorn*
is great. Others:
*Tigana*
, or anything by Kay really,
*Sabriel*
by Nix, and
*The Golden Compass*
are all excellent.

As a RJ fan who has never read any of your literature, which of your books should I start reading today?

I’d suggest Mistborn first.
*Warbreaker*
wouldn’t be a bad place to start either, as it’s a stand alone. Mistborn (the first book is called
*The Final Empire*
) is a complete trilogy. RJ readers tend to like series.

When working with new characters, how do you keep their voices straight in the early writing?

What is the largest battle you ever fought with your editor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was about Lightsong. He and I disagreed on some of the humor. Oddly, we were both right. He was claiming Lightsong wasn’t funny. What he meant was that I was allowing the humor to undermine setting. We came to a balance, and I think that Lightsong is much better for it.

was great, do you feel it benefited from online publishing? And would you publish that way again? It struck me that online publication is a great way to start a series, the first book is free then we are hooked.

#### JasonMichelsen

What is your typical daily wordcount as far as new material goes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It varies. 10 pages is still my goal. I usually hit it, and sometimes do much more. I write faster at the end of a book than the beginning. Also, some days I write four or five hours—some days I write fourteen or sixteen. Pretty consistently, I’ve done around 300k words a year for the last few years. Last year I pushed very hard and got around 400k.

is, by far, the best—and most difficult—thing I’ve written. It’s what I’m most proud of. For what is published, though,
*Warbreaker*
has the best writing of anything I’ve done.

What's next for you after finishing TWOT? Any new worlds in store, or going back to your other ones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Next is getting WoT 13&14, along with the final
*Alcatraz*
book. After that,
*The Way of Kings*
2. Then, finally, I’ll be able to do some new worlds. I’ve got two in particular I really want to visit.

How many new story ideas do you get in a year? How many do you act on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

About one or two of those end up as books. But each book is a combination of a dozen or more ideas.

What author inspired you the most in your writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Would it be cliched to say Robert Jordan? Because...well, it was Robert Jordan.

So, what do you think of Dot's term “Brandy Sandorow” = Brandon Sanderson + Cory Doctorow?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, boy. Brandy Sanderow? Sounds like a hobbit name.

## Entry #74

#### Danbarbour

I just finished
*Warbreaker*
and need a new book to read. I always have trouble picking a book. Any suggestions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Gave some book suggestions below. If you haven’t read Pratchett, Guards Guards is another good place to begin. I liked
*Servant of a Dark God*
, coming out from Tor next month, I believe. Also,
*Crystal Rain*
by Tobias Buckell and
*A Fire Upon the Deep*
by Vernor Vinge are great.

How do you group different ideas into one solid story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Look for conflict. Take the ideas, and try to make them intersect at points of conflict. Don’t let something happen that isn’t personal and important to at least one of the viewpoint characters.

Which magic system of yours would you be most inclined to use? (Also include channeling!)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably Feruchemy. The memorization potential would help me be a better writer.

Do you think you'll ever develop a language like Tolkien did?
*Elantris*
might count, actually, I'm not sure.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe. I did a lot of that in
*White Sand*
, which didn’t get published. I’ll do more for other books.

Has your Mormon upbringing consciously affected the recurring religious themes of your work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’d say it is more subconscious. I’m fascinated by religion, all types, because of my upbringing. That’s why you see religion as an antagonist in my books. Also, my religion has shaped how I see morality—and therefore, how many of my characters do.

#### ScottTRogers

How do you set up your workday for writing and getting all of your other "work" done?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I try to break it up and do things in several hour chunks. Writing during some, email others. The honest truth is, I usually end up ignoring other stuff and just writing. This is why I need an assistant.

Are you going to do a tour in the midwest ever? \*Cough\*cough\* Chicago \*cough\*cough\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hopefully! My publicist is watching this, so maybe your plea will encourage her....

What do you think the relationship between government and religion is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I like separation of church and state because it protects all of us. But I like it best when religion stays out of politics directly.

Any chances you'll do any future book-signing tours in Texas? (Houston, please!)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will be there 2011, as I mentioned. http://www.condfw.org/

What do you do to relax?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also, the funny thing is, writing IS relaxing for me. (Which makes me just about the luckiest guy ever.)

Which one comes first? The story or the setting (world, races, magic sys, etc) or do they emerge together?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the book. For Mistborn, setting was first. For
*Warbreaker*
, characters. It’s very hard to pinpoint, though, since I don’t start writing until I’ve developed all three.

#### Ryshon

What kind of average pagecount were you able to put out daily when working as a part time writer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was a special case, as I intentionally picked a job where I could write at work. I shot for 2000 words a day. I suggest to new writers that 2k a week be a minimum. That gives you a book in about a year.
