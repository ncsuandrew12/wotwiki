## Entry #1

#### Paul Ward

Nearly three years ago I had posted the group saying I was planning on writing a letter to RJ to ask him some questions and asked if anyone had anything they wanted to ask. Well, I had been hoping for some sort of response within 6-8 months, but it didn't happen. I then went away for two years. I was recently going through some boxes of stuff that my parents had saved/received for me and found RJ's response. I was quite surprised. My parents had never told me it had come. It is dated in March of 2000, about a year after I wrote to him.

Since the letter I wrote him seems to be missing from my computer, we can only try to guess what it was I asked him, but following are some answers and some possible questions that prompted them. For complete answers on a topic, email me.

## Entry #2

#### Paul Ward

Possible questions: Does balefire affect itself? Can you balefire balefire? If you balefire another person, but then you get balefired, what happens to the person you balefired?

#### Robert Jordan

The balefire weave exists wholly or partly outside time, which removes it from its own effect.

#### Paul Ward

This would have been helpful back during the balefire physics debates.

## Entry #3

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

I really think that the best suggestion for the murderer of Asmodean was that it was Moiraine acting under Compulsion imposed by Bela. Of course, that is not the answer, but it is the best suggestion from a fan.

#### Paul Ward

I can't remember who suggested that. It's the
*best*
suggestion?

## Entry #4

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Why did the
*ter'angreal*
doorway burn down when Lanfear and Moiraine passed through?

#### Robert Jordan

When Moiraine and Lanfear went through the
*ter'angreal*
, it burned in part because both were channeling, and the world on the other side of the doorway has a radically different set of natural laws. The odd optical effects witnessed in that other world are not artificially produced artifacts. (complete answer)

#### Paul Ward

The laws for channeling are different on the other side of the doorway...interesting.

## Entry #5

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: What's up with the Accepted test
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Anyone being tested is merely a visitor, or rider, on whoever she is in [another reality.]

#### Paul Ward

Therefore, though Sharina may be a real person, it doesn't mean anything in terms of her future advising to the Malkier throne.

#### Addendum

The full text of the response from RJ was
[provided in a later post](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/browse_thread/thread/aa762ff025bbfeb8/3d5f84b02f1b7ab4)
:

#### Robert Jordan

The places that novices visit while testing for Accepted are other realities, but it's not quite that simple. Anyone being tested is merely a visitor, or rider, on whoever she is in that world. Some of those who have not come back have died, and some have become absorbed in the different reality, but that is not to say that they are still alive in any sense that we would recognize. You really don't want to stay in the other reality, no matter how terrific it might seem.

[Verbatim. Everything he said about the Accepted test

## Entry #6

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Languages/accents?

#### Robert Jordan

Seanchan -> Texas accent. Two Rivers -> Irish/English accent. Illianers -> Dutch. Aiel -> somewhat Slavic. Tairen -> Spanish. Domani -> Indian. Saldaean -> Egyptian/North African.

## Entry #7

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: How did the Hundred Companions link to make the seals on the Dark One's prison?

#### Robert Jordan

They did not do it linked. They worked together individually, which made it more difficult, and that is part of the reason the seals have weakened so quickly. I never meant to imply linking. It is possible for large numbers to do a large project without linking, although it is more easily done in a circle.

## Entry #8

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Someone found a "Master Knifemaker" Herron. Was he the inspiration for heron-mark blades?

#### Robert Jordan

No... I am not familiar with him at all.

## Entry #9

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Is the Dark One pure True Power? Why does the Creator ignore Randland except to talk to Rand at the end of
*The Eye of the World*
?

#### Robert Jordan

No, the Dark One is not pure True Power. Who says the Creator takes little interest in the activities of mankind? And I will neither confirm nor deny that the Creator spoke to Rand.

#### Paul Ward

Neither confirm nor deny? What's up with that?

## Entry #10

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: ??

#### Robert Jordan

The taint and the True Power are both manifestations of the Dark One—they are the same substance, but those who access it are not destroyed in the same way.

#### Paul Ward

This would have been helpful—but then again, maybe not—during the taint theory debates.

## Entry #11

#### Paul Ward

There were a few other minor things as well, and of course:

Lots of other questions: "RAFO."

Enjoy.
