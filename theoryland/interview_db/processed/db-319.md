## Entry #1

#### Terez

This is a collection of quotes that were organized by Raina (presumably an old rasfwrj person) some time in 2001. Most of the original sources for the quotes she collected were found online, so those quotes aren't included here. These are only the leftover quotes, and as a result we have no idea where they came from or when they were asked, unless there are clues in the text. Sometimes it's not entirely clear if consecutive paragraphs are from different reports or the same report. We are, however, always searching for these lost interviews, and when we find them, we'll delete the quotes from this collection. I'll include Raina's introductory comments below, along with a list of the categories, each of which links to a Google Doc containing a link to the original category and an annotated copy of the page's original contents, linking to known sources and highlighting lost sources, which are the ones included here. Raina also drew from these interviews for her collection (and those quotes are not included here):

#### Raina

Below are collected various Jordan questions and answers, and reports from interviews. Not all quotes are guaranteed to be here, although I try to be thorough, and in some cases I've deleted answers that repeat material more or less verbatim. They are organized into categories by topic, and some are in more than one category, so you shouldn't find it hard to find a quotation you're looking for. Try 'Miscellaneous' if none of the categories seem to fit. As for such categories as 'Sex and Sexuality' and 'Bela'ï¿½you asked the questions, I just sort them.

And please stop asking who killed Asmodean or if Moiraine will be back. 'Read And Find Out' is already far too long!

In several cases, the people who provided the quotes have included comments of their own on the questions or answers. As such, any interpretations of Jordan's words do not necessarily represent my personal opinion. A few comments were written by me, and they are in blue text and signed
Like thisï¿½Raina
. so you should have no trouble working out which is which.

## Entry #2

#### [Reporter (Robert Jordan Himself)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-jordan.htm)

RJ fits the classic description of an author: Plenty of facial hair, a cane and a little on the podgy side. He didn't have an African hunting hat though…The cane looked pretty cool, and he assured us he'd use it if we tried to swarm him.

After he explained how they taught him to speak in the army. They'd stand you with your nose touching the barracks and get you to give your orders, if the people on the other side obeyed, you were half way there. If the barracks obeyed, you had it.

## Entry #4

#### [Reporter (Robert Jordan Himself)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-jordan.htm)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ first started reading at 4. He skipped children's books and read
*White Fang*
. By 5 he was reading Jules Verne. Since then it was his dream to become an author. But instead at uni he chose Maths(?) and Physics to become an engineer because he hadn't heard of a successful American author. Later, after he had had a near death experience, he decided it was do or don't time. He wrote
*The Eye of the World*
, and sent it in to a publisher hoping to get a reply something like "This is good, with some more experience you can do well." Instead he got, "This is great, we want to buy it."

#### Robert Jordan

RJ writes 8-10 hours a day. He usually misses lunch, sometimes dinner too. If he takes a day off, it's because his wife says he's working too hard. He says he writes because he likes it.

#### Robert Jordan

You’ve seen him in the back of the books. He’s got a scragglier gray beard and longer hair now. He walks with a cane. Hmm… Ah yes, and he still has the infamous hat, of course.

RJ’s Intro: Basic rules, such as no personalizing until after everyone’s through, pictures are fine, NO full frontal male nudity (when asked about back nudity, he gave an equally hearty no). Female nudity was not commented on.

RJ exercises his hands a lot to avoid Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and whatnot.

Can you personalize this?

#### Robert Jordan

You’ll have to get to the end of the line [it was a rule that sigs would come first, then anyone who wanted personalization would have to wait in line again].
Then he goes on to tell a story about a guy who was the last in line that wanted a personalization.

RJ: “You’ll have to get in back of the line.”
  
Fan: “I AM the back of the line.”
  
RJ: “Don’t make me repeat the rule.”
  
Fan: \*think, think\* \*walk around in a circle and returns to the table\*

## Entry #11

#### [Reporter (Robert Jordan Himself)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-jordan.htm)

#### Robert Jordan

[The next piece of conversation was between RJ and a guy from Russia. He started off asking how he liked Russia (since RJ went there before), and this whooooole thing got rolling. For the first part, I’ll just say that RJ has met some rather dangerous Russian mafia types (heh). Robert Jordan, a white-knuckled translator ready to wet himself, and a Godfather-type guy. “How do you know what you know?” Interesting picture there.

Second part: What everyone wants to know: RJ’s drinking habits.
  
When he was in Russia, he was surprised by the drinking there. Everyone says that Russians can and do drink a lot, he said, but he was amused that people kept telling HIM to slow down and eat before drinking. The man can handle a good deal. I mean, \*\*\*\*, he said vodka was like mother’s milk.

“When I was young, when I really used to drink”—Imagine if you will, the Creator himself, sitting at a table with a bunch of drunken buddies. There’s $4700 dollars on the table. Yes, this is a drinking game. At any point, someone can say ‘stand’. The drinkers have to stand up, hold their hands above their heads, spin around three times, and sit back down. If you become unable to do that, you lose. After TWO QUARTS of Russian vodka, everyone else is floored, and our man wins. Not only that, but he drags his drunken friend back to their room. He mentioned that he didn’t get undressed for bed that night (as if admitting some weakness from the alcohol).

He used to know all of 7 words of useful Russian, most of them curses (he repeated two of them, to the amusement of the guy he was talking to).]

#### [Question (How did the series originate?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-origin.htm)

To the books then. The Wheel of Time is a fantasy series epic in size and scale. How did it all begin—and what was your inspiration for it?

#### Robert Jordan

It's really hard to say. There's all sorts of things that come about before you start writing a series. You don't have "an idea" that becomes a short story, or a book. A short story is maybe hundreds of ideas that have come together, a novel is thousands of ideas that have come together. But The Wheel of Time—I was thinking at one point about what it'd really be like to be tapped on the shoulder and told "You were born to be the savior of mankind. And oh yes—you're probably going to die in the end and no, you can't resign—it's your job, you're stuck with it".

Then I had been thinking about the source of myths, the source of legends. About whether some of them might not have been personifications of natural events, the way we say some of them are supposed to be. What if some of them were things that people had done, and had simply been told and told until it became a myth and legend?

At the same time, I was thinking about the degradation of information over distance. The further you are from an event in either space or time, the less reliable your knowledge of the event. Information inevitably degrades over distance, whether it's spatial or temporal.

I was thinking about lots of other things too, and it began to coalesce. It was the beginnings of what would become the Wheel of Time. I let it mull over for four or five years, then I thought I was ready to sit down and write. But it took four years to write
*The Eye of the World*
because I discovered there were a lot of other things I had to think and sort out.

Was the storyline for "New Spring" one that was created at the same time as the rest of the WoT plot, or did you come up with it specifically for the
*Legends*

#### Robert Jordan

The basis was notes that I had made for myself on backstory, things that I had never intended to put into the books themselves, but that I needed to know to write the books: such as where did Moiraine and Lan meet, and where did they come from.

#### Robert Jordan

Rand and Tam al’Thor originally started out as one character.

He is a man in his 30s from Emond’s Field in the present.

(Earlier, when his story ‘starts’) There isn’t much for a kid from a small village out wherever to do that does not involve backbreaking work. At about 15, he runs away to become a soldier (yes, a field that does involve backbreaking labor). After 20 years or so as a soldier, Rand/Tam wants to go home, but when he does, he realizes he’s no longer the boy that left that little village. “And prophecy is on his heels”. Maybe something of the sort will be done in a future series.

[At this point, people were managing to wedge their way in between me and the table (coming within three inches of RJ), so I didn’t really get the whole question. Something along the lines of:] Are you making this up as you go along, or do you have everything planned out?

#### Robert Jordan

Everything is planned out. RJ has humongous files on his computer dedicated to certain topics. Example: two files for the Aes Sedai. The first one has info on each Aes Sedai. Everything she wears, eats, where she was born, etc. The second is history of the Tower. Halls, Amyrlins, organization, etc. He then said he was lucky to get a LS120 drive, because these files were getting too large for 1.44’s.

This surprised me, there has been a thread around here in which was stated that Dragon, Caro-Kann and the Coramorant (I'm not sure of the last one) are chess openings.

When asked whether he was surprised that there is so much discussion on the net everyday, he simply replied, "no". He then explained that it was important as an author to have a big ego, which he did. He then explained that you didn't have to be arrogant, even though he had been described so occasionally.

## Entry #27

#### [Raina (The Wheel of Time game)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-game.htm)

The following questions all come from a single interview, published in a computer magazine called
*PCPowerPlay*
, in November of '99.

#### PCPOWERPLAY

So how much of The Wheel of Time game bears the mark of Robert Jordan?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I only know a little bit about the game. I'm not a programmer. My real programming skills are decades out of date. I started when you had to learn how to operate a key-punch machine so you could do your stacks of cards to hand into the mainframe, 'cause there was nothing else than the mainframe!

#### PCPOWERPLAY

Oh dear! So what role did you play in the development of the game?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

To a large extent it was that I said I wanted certain things to be done. And it was not that I was asking them to do these things, it was that I was telling them "Do these things, or there's no deal". They were okay with that. The things I asked them to do made the game much more complex; made it much more difficult to design—hence it wasn't on the streets three years ago.

#### PCPOWERPLAY

It could have been ready, theoretically, three years ago. How long has the game been in development then?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

For at least four or five years. The thing is, I wanted it to be a game where it'd be, at least in mathematical terms, impossible to play the same game twice. Every time you start the Wheel of Time, it's gotta be different. I mean, the landscape is the same, but you're not going to be able to play the same game again—there are too many changes in conditions. There are
*ter'angreal*
(magic foci, used as offensive and defensive weapons in the game)—there is a large library of
*ter'angreal*
in the game. But they are not handed over to the players. A random selection is made when you start up the game, and distributed at random over the landscape. I also wanted the NPCs to be as close to player characters as possible. So you can bribe them to lie to or kill others. And they'll respond to you depending on your character and the way you've dealt with others.

#### PCPOWERPLAY

So why did you specifically ask for all this?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Because I think the world changes and things are different. Things change all the time. It seemed to me that making a game where you learn all the rules and zip through and go back and do it again to see if you can do it faster is boring. I find it boring.

#### PCPOWERPLAY

Given the almost rabid demeanor of your fans, how well do you think they will receive the WoT game?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

I hope well. It takes place somewhere between fifty and [a] hundred years before the time of the books. It doesn't involve any characters from them either, and it's not going to be exactly like the books—there's no way it can be as it's a different genre altogether.

It's shaping up to be a really good game. Hopefully, if it's well received, there will be modules that take people more into the world as it exists in the books, and possibly even modules where people play characters in the books, or interact with characters from the books—which I'm hoping is something the fans would love.

The game also uses the Unreal engine, and one of my favorite quotes is "It uses the Unreal engine better than Unreal does". The design team have done so well with it that they've been hired to design the sequel to Unreal—Unreal 2. Another quote I liked was "Every year we're promised something new, something different, something fresh. At last somebody has delivered".

#### PCPOWERPLAY

You come across as someone who knows games!

#### ROBERT JORDAN

I play games! But the games I play are Chess, and Go, and very firmly reality-based military-strategy and tactic games like Civilisation, Sim City, Sim World and so on. I really enjoy those. I don't play them very often though, and recently just cleared 12 GB of games from my hard drive.

#### PCPOWERPLAY

That's a lot of space for games!

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Yeah, yeah. Well, there are shelves of games up at home. I buy the darn things, I just find very little time to play them.

#### PCPOWERPLAY

To change the topic a bit, do you feel threatened, as a novelist, by games becoming more appealing as elaborate story-telling devices?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Year after year, they tell me about the death of books. Yet I see more books sold. You can't take a computer into the bath and let it dry out if you happen to drop it by accident. You can't take a computer to the beach without worrying about sand getting into it. With a book, you can treat it as rough as you want to, and if it ends up destroyed, you can buy another one at a relatively low cost. Books also don't have maintenance costs nor need to have their batteries replaced on regular occasions. You can just put one in your coat pocket and walk. I think that says it all, really.

#### [Question (Themes of the series)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-themes.htm)

Some people have found so much depth to your books, that they've claimed you've attempted to start a new philosophical movement, or even a new religion, with the Wheel of Time. What have you set out to do with the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm not trying to create a philosophy, I'm not trying to create a religion. If people think that, they're missing the point.

What I'm primarily trying to do is tell a story. If I get to ask you a few questions along the way, that's good. And if I don't get to ask you a few questions, that's good also. If there are any messages it's that everybody has to struggle against evil, as opposed to good. Because you can't depend on a few heroes to take care of it. If you depend on heroes, evil's gonna win. Also, how it's not easy to tell the difference between bad and good sometimes. Sometimes you think a course of action is the right thing to do. And if you do it and a few million people starve to death somewhere, was it really the right thing to do? Unintended consequences too: every action you take will have at least two results that you never intended and one of them will be a result that you really didn't want. You have to contend with that under all circumstances. You can never figure out all consequences of what you do, and you can't stop them because of that. I'm fascinated by these ideas.

#### Robert Jordan

He answered John M. Ford (again), Greg Bear, and C.S. Friedman (again), who also has written a lot of good science fiction.

He actually reads a lot less science fiction, because he doesn't like distopias all that much. He likes technology. Why would people have to die at age 30 in the mud in some miserable hovel when they could live so much longer, do so much more.

Especially since it wasn't that long ago that people in American did die at the average age of 30. You just had to go back a few hundred years.

#### Robert Jordan

Female Dragon..NO when a female hero is needed she is one of the ones bound to the Wheel. Jordan did mention a name but I didn't hear it. But he did say the Dragon is never female.

Let's try and clear some of this up... I can't remember the exact question, but from what I read in this thread, it doesn't matter (I haven't read the Female Dragon thread). RJ said that, no, it is not possible to have a female Dragon. If the wheel needs a female Dragon, then it would weave in \*insert female Dragon name here\*. Probably because of the blank faces he was getting he then added, you can find her in the scene where Mat blows the Horn...

He also said that a soul ready to be reborn cannot change gender, therefor the Dragon is ALWAYS male.

Each age is NOT precisely the same with each new turning of the Wheel. I actually asked RJ to explain this before
*Eye*
even came out, because he was trying to explain the cosmology to me and I wasn't getting it. The analogy he used (for the differences between an Age in one turning and in another) was to say that it would be like standing in front of what looked to be two copies of the same painting; but as you looked closely, you'd start to find tiny, subtle differences, more and more differences the more closely you looked, until you eventually realized that the paintings were almost completely different.

Yes. [Can't give you specifics of response, but he did say that it (True Power) was the reason for the difference in Traveling.]

## Entry #44

#### [Mahiro (The Heroes and the Horn)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-horn.htm)

As I promised, here is a short synopsis of what RJ said at the book signing regarding whether or not Rand is King Aemon Reborn.

#### Robert Jordan

For Rand to be Aemon reborn, Rand would have to be the same height as Aemon if Lanfear was correct in
*The Shadow Rising*
that Rand is always the same height in each of his lives.

RJ stated that Aemon was 6'1" tall, but when I asked if Lanfear was correct, RJ stated that she was not. Normally this would not say either way if Rand was Aemon.

RJ knew immediately where I was heading (this is one very intelligent man). RJ confirmed that Rand is NOT Aemon. :-(

#### MAHIRO

\*sighs\*. He stated that it was like an author's prerogative to dangle "bait" in front of people and snatch it away. That's cruel and twisted. :-)

This not just torpedoes my theory out of the water, but just nukes it completely.

Thanks to Adrian for letting me use you as a sounding board for my theory.

If anyone wants his exact words, I can post a transcript later.

Here's what I got...

#### MAHIRO

Mr. Jordan...

#### The Creator

Yeah.

#### MAHIRO

How tall was the last king of Manetheren?

#### The Creator

The last king of Manetheren...?

#### MAHIRO

Uh-huh.

#### The Creator

The last king of... Height?

#### MAHIRO

Yes.

#### The Creator

Ummm...He'd be about 6'1" [six feet one inch].

#### MAHIRO

6'1"? Okay. And was Lanfear correct that Rand is always the same height in each of his lives?

#### The Creator

Ahhh, no.

#### MAHIRO

No... okay. Thank you.

[At this point I turned to leave.]

#### The Creator

Rand uhhh, Rand was not the last King of Manetheren.

#### MAHIRO

Thank you.

#### The Creator

I very rarely come out and tell you guys something like that. It's much more intriguing to simply dangle a bit of "bait" in front of you and snatch it away. But, ahh no. That's that's that's definitely a "blue sky" direction.

#### MAHIRO

Aan'allein, there it is nervous statements and all. You should have been there. "you can... hear him. You can... bathe in his presence...words cannot even begin to describe it. You must experience it to know. You must."

Oops, got a little carried away there... ;-)

#### Footnote

If anyone is Aemon reborn, it's Mat, since Mat had memories of being Aemon before he got his memories from the Eelfinn. However, the clues in that case point to the Old Blood and Mat being a descendant of Aemon rather than Aemon reborn.

#### [Signing Report (The Age of Legends)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-AOL.htm)

Tonight I asked him, sneakily and in-between two people asking him to sign their books, about whether or not anything was still remaining from Lews Therin's palace, in other words if there were still ruins left of it in the current world.

#### Robert Jordan

Sadly, he answered a very clear "No, nothing is left of that anymore."

#### REPORTER

This means that the ruins underneath the Panarch's palace in Tanchico are not the ruins of Lews Therin's palace.

#### [Signing Report (Mat Cauthon)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-mat.htm)

The person said something along the lines of: "My wife thinks Perrin is the sexiest man alive."

#### Robert Jordan

RJ responded by saying that he, himself, found Perrin kind of boring, and he didn't understand why people liked him so much. But what really surprised him was that the most popular guy was Mat, the guy he had thought would be the most hated.

RJ then went into a minute-long tirade about how nice guys never get girls. He said that, while the girl might think she wants the good guy, she will always end up driving off with the guy in the Harley.
Yes, he said Harley.

#### [Signing Report (Moiraine Damodred)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-moir.htm)

Ok, I got my book signed in Vroman's in Pasadena, CA, today. RJ was extremely friendly, and talked to everyone, laughing and even teasing a bit. One could say he was "jolly".

Anyway, when it was my turn, I asked him two questions. I'll put parts in quotes when they are exactly what was said (or close enough), and I wrote it down so I'd remember.

As he signed my first book, I asked, "Is Cyndane's power roughly equal to, say... Moiraine?"

#### Robert Jordan

He had a surprised look on his face for a moment, then it became amused, and he gave me a RAFO. His face indicated to me that I was absolutely right, but obviously it's not evidence.

## Entry #48

#### [Signing Report (Padan Fain)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-fain.htm)

(Didn't catch the question exactly, but it regarded Fain's escape and the dead prisoners.)

#### Robert Jordan

Fain killed the prisoners, not his rescuer. And it wasn't Lanfear.

#### Footnote

RJ later
[confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=188#11)
that it was Ingtar who rescued Fain from the dungeon in Fal Dara.

Next came question time. I was the first one to buy a ticket, the first person to arrive, I was sitting right under his nose so I figured I might as well be the first one to ask a question as well. Me: "Is Verin Black Ajah?"

#### Robert Jordan

"C'mon, RAFO!" (Sorry, Isam but I don't think you'll mind me posting...)

I guess he was just setting the mood for the rest of the evening.

#### [Signing Report (The Black Ajah)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-black.htm)

Does the Black Ajah still have the dice they stole, when the first thirteen left the Tower?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out.

#### Reporter

The only time these dice are mentioned is when Nynaeve, Egwene and Elayne are reading the lists of stolen
*ter'angreal*
they got from Verin. I first thought that maybe they had something to do with Mat but I couldn't find any evidence for it.

#### Robert Jordan

Next, I believe, was the aforementioned big mouth. In the interests of not getting banned, we will simply call him Cranially Undernourished Bozo. He was asking something about Ishamael and about him being the only one to use the True Power therefore he is Mordin. RJ started explaining that he didn't necessarily have to be Mordin to which CUB declared that he was avoiding the question. RJ then gives a complicated explanation about the Watcher watching the events unfurling (this is all from memory and unfortunately I can't remember everything) which ended in a question if that is what he meant. CUB with a confused look on his face was obviously in over his head, and started planning how he could become a bigger nuisance.

FAQ: Who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

Should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer. [yeah, uh huh...] Ok, we know that. But he also said that we should know based on where everyone was, what they were thinking, what they were doing. Duh, right? But he made a point of mentioning where. For people thinking it was a Traveller, would 'where' be important? Dunno...

His list of candidates included the Aes Sedai, Nynaeve, Aviendha, Bela, and God knows who else.

And you know why he won't tell us? Because he likes to see us SQUIRM. He said it in a friendly voice, but you could tell he meant it.

#### [Signing Report (The Forsaken)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-forsaken.htm)

Well, It was the second time this week I got to get my book signed and talk to the great RJ. The first time was in Leiden and I didn't prepare anything so I asked something lame about what he thought of the cover art. This time I forgot to think it over again so at the last minute I had to come up with something. It turned out quite funny:

Me: "Did Slayer take Asmodean to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
before, or after he killed him?"

#### Robert Jordan

He and some other people started laughing, he thought a little and answered with a smile:

"What makes you think Asmodean is dead?"

I laughed and he continued:

"Yeah, you screw with my head, I screw with yours..." (that's actually what he said.)

#### Reporter

So Incidentally I made Jordan laugh and swear, but not answer the question.

But hey, I didn't get a RAFO.

#### [Signing Report (Theology)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-theo.htm)

This one was asking about the lack of churches in Randland. They apparently have religious beliefs and such, so why aren't they there?

#### Robert Jordan

Churches and other places of worship are for people to connect with and reaffirm the presence of God (or whatever). The people of Randland see signs of their Creator every day through the One Power. If common people today could walk around performing miracles at will, we wouldn't have as much of a need for that confirmation either.

#### [Signing Report (Other Lands)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-lands.htm)

Were the Seanchan animals created before or after the Shadowspawn?

#### Robert Jordan

They are the 'exotics'. They were brought to Randland from parallel dimensions (like in the Portal Stones). When Rand saw grolm in the Portal Stone world, he was seeing them in the native 'land'.

#### Footnote

This answer is a bit puzzling in that later questions to
[RJ about Portal Stones](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204)
indicate that they connect to Mirror Worlds, not Parallel Worlds. In addition, the BWB indicates that the Seanchan exotics were brought back from Parallel Worlds via Portal Stones.

#### [Signing Report (Bela)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-bela.htm)

As he grabbed my second book, I asked, "Is Bela the Creator?"

#### Robert Jordan

"No, she's Nae'blis," he said, laughing. He went on to say something along the lines of: I know all your theories about her being Nae'blis.

#### Reporter

As he handed me my book, I asked, "Is Bela the Dark One?"

#### Robert Jordan

He laughed. "Hmmmm," he said, "I might do something with that... No, just kidding."

#### Reporter

I stepped away but lingered as he signed the next person's first book.

#### Robert Jordan

As he grabbed the second book, he said, "She's the avatar of Ilyena Sunhair." [I think it was Sunhair. Is that her name?]

#### Reporter

He went on to say that Ilyena died, but had bad karma. I'm serious.

In response to the people in the back of the line (which had circled around two book aisles to the RJ table again), he asked the following question of them...

#### Robert Jordan

"Have you ever noticed how Bela and Shaidar Haran are never in same scene?"

Those WERE Bela monkeys in the back. And, no, RJ wasn't messing with them.
