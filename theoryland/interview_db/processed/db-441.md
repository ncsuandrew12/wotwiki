## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

I haven't really mentioned it on the blog here, but I am going to be the toastmaster at
[MileHiCon](http://milehicon.org/)
in Denver next weekend, October 23rd through 25th. I'll post a specific schedule next week of where you'll find me at the con. I'll also be doing a signing on the 22nd at the Koelbel Library in Centennial that's open to all (convention registration not required). This is all before the release of
*The Gathering Storm*
, though, so Denver residents should also keep in mind that I'll be back in town on November 1st during the book tour. For details please see my
[Events page](http://brandonsanderson.com/events)
.

I'm going to be signing and personalizing Sam Weller's Bookstore's copies of
*The Gathering Storm*
on October 19th starting at 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time, so if you want to order a copy from them, that is the last moment you can request a personalization. They'll still accept orders after that for the remainder of the signed stock, but you'll be limited to a signature and a number unless you call them before 5:00 on the 19th. For details please see Item #4 on the
[Release Events page](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/57/THE-GATHERING-STORM-Release-Events#item4)
.

The limited-edition
[Mistborn Table of Allomantic Metals](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/item/39/)
art prints have been delivered here to Dragonsteel Entertainment headquarters, and artist Isaac Stewart and I will be signing them tonight. We'll start taking orders probably tomorrow; expect a big announcement here on the blog.

In this week's
[Writing Excuses podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/10/11/)
, Dan, Howard, and I talk with Larry Correia, author of
[*Monster Hunter International*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439132852/?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
, about plot-driven vs. character-driven fiction.

The most recentMistborn 3 annotations involve the trilogy's first ball scene in quite a while. Chapter 30 was a lot of fun for me to write; I hope it gave many readers fond memories of Mistborn 1.
