## Entry #1

#### Amazon

Robert Jordan kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.

## Entry #2

#### Question

What book has had the most significant impact on your life?

#### Robert Jordan

The King James version of the Bible. That seems a cliche, but I can't think of any other book that has had as large an impact in shaping who I am.

## Entry #3

#### Question

You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVDâ€”what are they?

#### Robert Jordan

The one book would be whatever book I was currently writing. I mean, I hate falling behind in the work. The one CD would contain the best encyclopedia I could find on desert island survival. The DVD would contain as much of Beethoven, Mozart, and Duke Ellington as I could cram onto it.

#### Question

What is the worst lie you've ever told?

#### Robert Jordan

It's hard to think of one since I am genetically incapable of lying to women and that takes out 52% of the population right there.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Describe the perfect writing environment.

#### Robert Jordan

Any place that has my computer, a CD player for music, a comfortable chair that won't leave me with a backache at the end of a long day, and very little interruption.

Who is the one person living or dead that you would like to have dinner with?

## Entry #8

#### Question

If you could have one superpower what would it be?

#### Robert Jordan

That depends. If I'm feeling altruistic, it would be the ability to heal anything with a touch, if that can be called a superpower. If I'm not feeling very altruistic, it would be the ability to read other people's minds, to finally be able to get to the bottom of what they really mean and what their motivations are.
