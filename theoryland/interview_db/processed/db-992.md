## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

This past weekend I had a great time at JordanCon. Next year's Author Guest of Honor will be Patrick Rothfuss, with Artist Guest of Honor Larry Elmore. It should be awesome.

While I was there I signed a number of books for two booksellers, The Missing Volume and Basement Books. They each also have a handful of copies of my
*Firstborn/Defending Elysium*
convention exclusiveâ€”but I forgot to sign those. Whoops. Still, if you're not at a con, this is the only way to get your hands on that hardcover until much later this year. Both booksellers will ship to you.

The Missing Volume

Email: info@themissingvolume.com

Plenty of signed copies of
*The Emperor's Soul*
and one signed copy of a number of other hardcovers and paperbacks such as
*The Alloy of Law*
, Wheel of Time books, and
*The Way of Kings*
. Inquire for details.

Basement Books
  
Email: tsbooks@mindspring.com

20 signed copies of

(very hard to find elsewhere!), a few signed 1st editions of
*Warbreaker*
, copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
triple-signed by Brandon, Ben, & Isaac, signed copies of
*The Emperor's Soul*
.

The latest Writing Excuses podcast is another
[brainstorming episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2013/04/21/)
, where Mary, Howard, and Dan help me come up with ideas for a story about psychic birds. Enjoy. And yes, I did end up writing this story (a novelette) after doing the podcast. More on that in the future.

## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tor.com has put up
[another two chapters](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/04/the-way-of-kings-reread-chapters-3-and-4)
of their reread of
*The Way of Kings*
: chapters 3 and 4. This covers Shallan's introduction and Kaladin's arrival at the Shattered Plains.

If you missed my AMA at Reddit, you can find my answers

.

I've finished uploading the videos of me writing one of the interludes from
*Words of Radiance*
, the sequel to
*The Way of Kings*
. I've also made a
[high-speed version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNHe1BElX-g&hd=1)
of all of the writing, which you can see below, if the real-time version was too slow for you. There's a playlist of all of the real-time videos
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHlPczUmjrQ&hd=1&list=PLSH_xM-KC3ZviGuhA9pT7ETB481Fw-VEL)
, and the final video (if you were keeping up already) is
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6FR9y5oo0&hd=1)
.

This has been a bit of an experiment, to show my writing process. Now that it's all done, what have you thought about the experiment?
