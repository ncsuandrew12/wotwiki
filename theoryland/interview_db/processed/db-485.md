Wheel of Time fansite
[TarValon.net](http://www.tarvalon.net/)
is hosting another charity drive—this time in support of
[Doctors Without Borders](http://doctorswithoutborders.org/)
. If you're interested, consider helping out at
[their team's donation page](http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/melissa-dombrowski/tarvalon)
. It looks like they have a small number of "thank you" prizes as well, including one of the limited edition copies of
*The Gathering Storm*
.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did a few more radio and podcast interviews in the last couple of days. They'll probably be the last in a while; if you didn't get a chance to see me on the tour (a few Utah and Idaho events are still coming up), I said a lot of the same types of things on these shows as I said at my appearances. (Though for details and sometimes videos of my appearances you can check out Dragonmount's Storm Leader reports.) Today I recorded for a show on CNN radio that should be airing soon. I also appeared on
[David Lemberg's Science and Society podcast](http://scienceandsociety.net/2009/11/30/brandon-sanderson-the-gathering-storm-the-wheel-of-time-series/)
yesterday, as well as another appearance on the Louie b. Free show, where I really got to go in depth about this amazing phenomenon I've had the honor to be a part of. My first appearance was on
[November 3rd](http://www.vindy.com/louie-free/archives/2009/nov/03/)
(only the "Part One" link works, but that's the whole thing). My segment starts at the 3:03:14 mark (yes, that's three hours into the show). Scrubbing through the previous 3 hours I heard adult content disclaimers several times, so keep that in mind! My segment of yesterday's show starts at the 30:47 mark. Give them both a listen!

#### Footnote

The audio from the Louie b. free show on November 30, 2009 no longer appears to be available.

Then there's my own podcast. Though they did a fine job without me during the tour (such as in
[last week's episode about NaNoWriMo](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/11/22/)
—by the way, how many of my fans won this year?), Howard Tayler and Dan Wells were happy to have me back for this week's Writing Excuses episode where we discussed
[mixing humor with drama and horror](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/12/01/)
. Check it out.

I've gotten a bit behind in mentioning the Mistborn 3 annotations. The most recent additions mention
[the creation of Inquisitors and how to defeat Ruin](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/306/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty)
,
[Spook as the Survivor of the Flames](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/307/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-One)
,
[Marsh \*spoiler\*ing Penrod](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/308/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-Two)
, and
[Yomen's backstory](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/309/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-Three)
.

Finally, it looks like Amazon has put up
[a new page for
*The Way of Kings*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765326353?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
—and this time it's for the real thing, unlike the old page with its hilarious reviews. The page count they list is optimistic (the text would have to be tiny; depending on how the book is designed I expect the final count to be north of 800 pages), but the rest of it, including the release date, should be pretty much right. Assuming I get my revisions done on time and to my satisfaction! Right now I'm back hard at work at
*Towers of Midnight*
, which I'm guessing will come out more toward the end of November 2010 rather than exactly a year after
*The Gathering Storm*
. Anyway, there will be more here on
*The Way of Kings*
in the months to come. Stay tuned.
