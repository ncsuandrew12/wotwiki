## Entry #1

#### gammahunter

I just returned from the Philadelphia Book Signing. Some interesting tidbits.

## Entry #2

#### gammahunter

My friend asked about his favorite character, Padan Fain, wondering where he has been for the best three books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wanted to include him in
*The Gathering Storm*
. He then said he 'may or may not have been' writing about him on the train ride on the way to the signing!

#### gammahunter

So, pretty much confirmation that Fain will be in book 13! Where do you all think he is? My friend thinks he is posing as an agent from the Dark One and manipulating Taim in the Black Tower.

## Entry #3

#### gammahunter

I asked about the controversy over Graendal and if he thought it was obvious as to her fate when writing it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said no, and he knew the community would debate it. He said he won't answer anything about her until the next book because she will be mentioned at least in some POVs.

## Entry #4

#### gammahunter

I asked if Graendal were dead and had she killed Asmodean could he pop back up in Caemlyn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said no. He said that Rand only took Rahvin out of the Pattern for 15 minutes to an hour. So, even if the Choedan Kal were 1000 times stronger than Rand with the fat man it would only be like 9 days at most. More interesting, however, is that he said that we have not seen anyone who could burn someone out of the Pattern that long, however, it was possible for someone to be that strong!â€”Who or what could this be?

## Entry #5

#### gammahunter

Moiraine is my favorite character. I told him to please not keep us waiting until
*A Memory of Light*
for Moiraine.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said 'I can tell you she will be mentioned in the next book.' So this told me nothing.

## Entry #6

#### gammahunter

I overheard someone asking about Rand at the end of the book.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said that Rand is going to begin to stabilize in the next book.

## Entry #7

#### gammahunter

That's pretty much it. The Q&A was short. Mostly people asked about style and the writing process. Brandon seemed awesome. I really liked his speech about how he got to begin writing the books. It was touching. I fortunately did not get Mistborn spoiled for me. I am going to begin reading that this week!
