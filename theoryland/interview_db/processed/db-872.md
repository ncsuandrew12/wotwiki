## Entry #1

#### Bravehamster

At the signing tonight in Lexington, I asked Brandon about [the Song]. This is pretty much exactly what he said:

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan's notes on this are very clear: the Tinkers will never find their song. They've lost it for too long, that even if someone stood in front of them singing The Song, they would just nod their head, say 'that's a nice song' and go on their way.

#### Bravehamster

He also confirmed that Rand was singing The Song in Tuon's garden.

#### Footnote

To be clear, RJ
[clarified](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=648#1)
that 'the song' itself was a mystification of the growing songs, and so technically 'the song' never existed.

## Entry #2

#### Bravehamster

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also: Siuan going into to a burning building to save Mat was a deliberate reference to her first conversation with him.

#### Footnote

That was not actually her first conversation with him; she met all the boys in Fal Dara, but only Rand's meeting was on screen. The conversation referenced is in
*The Dragon Reborn*
Chapter 20, "Visitations".
