              How does it feel to be a mentor to younger writers?  Well I think the fact that I’ve taught a university course on How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy for ten years, I kind of had to get used to that pretty early.  I took over the class because they were going to cancel it because there was no one else to teach it.  The teacher who had been teaching it retired.  And so I stepped in and took it over and I still teach it to this day.  My requirement being that I get to post the lectures online.  So if you want to read them-- err watch them, you can watch them at brandonsanderson.com/writing-advice.  Or you can ask for one of these little cards that has my url on it when you come through.  How’s it feel?  It feels pretty cool honestly.  I like interacting with new, young writers.  I like helping them out.  I’m really proud of like Brian [McClellan] and Janci [Patterson] who’ve gotten published.  [aside to the booksellers] You have Brian’s book right there?  It’s really quite good.  He’s one of those ones I really can’t take credit for, because he came through and he was writing awesome stuff and so I told him like the business side.  Here’s how you go get published.  Some of the other ones, I’ve been able to give them pointers on their actual writing, that I think have helped out.  But I think with Brian he was there already, he just needed the boost to get into the industry.  It feels pretty cool.

              Do I draw from a specific set of life experiences for my writing or is it just from my imagination?  I would say my imagination is fueled by my specific life experiences.  So the answer is both.  Everything I see can become a part of my books, but at the same time sometimes it’s just a happy accident.  People ask about Steelheart, the bad metaphors.  One of the things about the main character is he is really bad with metaphoric language, comically bad.  That happened on accident, I was writing his viewpoint and I’m like “This character is dry, he needs more of a soul, he needs more life.  How can I make him work?” and I accidentally wrote a bad metaphor.  That happens a lot when you’re writing, you know, purple prose and bad metaphors just come out when you’re not looking.  It’s like they sneak out onto the page and you’re like “That was really bad”.  Then I paused and thought “Well, let’s go ahead and leave it in *laughter* and run with this.”  And it was great because it became a metaphor for David’s metaphor-- kind of coincidentally or ironically or whatever--  that bad metaphors become a metaphor themselves because he became the character who tries too hard.  He’s /really/ earnest and he’s going to get stuff done but he’s trying a little too hard.  And that’s where the bad metaphors come from, he overthinks them.  He tries too hard to put something together and it ends up as just a big mess.  But his earnestness comes through it, and that became his character and it works really well.  But that one’s just an accident.

              What is the favorite character that I have written?  I would say Perrin, from The Wheel of Time.  Because I can’t pick my own characters, because they don’t feel like I’m--  They are my favorite while I’m writing them, whoever they are.  But Perrin was my favorite Wheel of Time character and when I got to finish the Wheel of Time he was the character that Robert Jordan left the least amount of notes on.  In fact there was one sentence, for three books-worth, about him.  And so I got to take him and really Perrin was the one I had the most influence on through the course of those three books and it was very special to me him being my favorite character and being able to do that.

              Yes, excellent question.  I was not a reader until I had a teacher, eighth grade teacher--this is true--Ms. Reeder. *laughter*  Yes, it’s really true R-E-E-D-E-R, was my teacher in eighth grade and she gave me a fantasy novel for the first time and convinced me to read it.  It took a little work on her part because I was not a reader.  It was Dragonsbane by Barbara Hamley, a kind of classic standalone epic fantasy--  And it’s standalone because the sequels she wrote twenty years later when she was really depressed are /very different/.  They’re worth reading but they don’t feel like sequels.  Dragonsbane’s a fantastic book.  All of Anne McCaffey’s books were next to that in the school library, like in the card catalogue, under the title so I went to them next and they had a huge influence on me.  I would say those two were the biggest.  And then Melanie Rawn’s books were next to those, so I read all of those.  And then the first book series I discovered on my own, when it wasn’t already finished, was the Wheel of Time.  Wheel of Time, the first book came out about a year after I got into reading fantasy novels and I found the big one on the shelf and was like “Oooh that’s a big book.  *laughter*  I’m going to read that big book.”  And I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  *laughter*  Now lot’s of Wheel of Time fans can say that, they didn’t know what they were getting into.  I trump them, okay?  I really didn’t know what I was getting myself into in picking up that first Wheel of Time book and reading it.

              Do you ever write like two versions of a scene in a book and if you do how do you decide which--

             <h4>

             </h4>
             <div>
              Two versions of the same scene.  I do it quite frequently.  Every book there will be a couple times.  Usually what happens is I’m writing a scene and I’m not pleased with it and so I put it aside and I write it again the next day.  And usually letting me subconscious work on it means I end up fixing it.  About one out of ten times I start writing it and I realize “It was right the first way, why am I writing something new?”  And then I just go back to the book, and it wasn’t that the scene was bad it’s just I had a bad day.  And sometimes you do, no matter what you write you are going to think it stinks.  How do I decide?  It’s very instinctive, I’ve never had one like “These are both equally good”  Always I know one of them is not working.  In fact the best way to get over writer’s block, I find, is to write the scene anyway, have anything you can think of happen--even if it doesn’t make sense in your story--so that you get the scene out, and then attack it again the next day after you have had time to think about it.

              Where did I get the idea for writing the Reckoners series?  I almost got in a car wreck.  I was driving to a book signing and I was late and somebody cut me off in traffic.  And it was like--  I had to slam on the brakes and things like that and I thought--  At that moment I’m like “You, person in front of me, are so lucky I don’t have superpowers, ‘cause if I did I would blow your car up right now.  BOOM”  It’s a great Michael Bay effect, like it explodes and I drive through the smoke.  It was really awesome I remember it.  And then I was immediately horrified, right?  I’m like “Here I write all these books about people protecting the world with their powers and what would I do if I had them?  I’d be blowing up people because they inconvenience me.”  *laughter*  And this is where the series came from, I thought about that the entire rest of the drive, which was about another hour.  And I thought “What if--  What could we do if people just started manifesting superpowers and--  You couldn’t throw them in prison, or if you did they’d just break out.  You couldn’t defeat them with the armies.  What would the society do if there were legitimately superpowered individuals?”  It’s kind of the same tactic that Watchmen took, if you’ve ever read that, but it kind of goes the other direction with “They are all evil, what do we do?”  That was the origin and I wrote a whole book series about it.

              How do I decide who lives and who dies?  I just decide based on the demands that they make to me by their character arcs and the risks they want to take.  I don’t ever feel like I’m killing characters off, I feel like I am writing the stories that need to be written the way they have to be written.  They often are planned out ahead of time, I’m an architect as a writer, I come up with an outline and then I hang my story on it.  But characters have veto power over the story, if they decide they want to go somewhere else.  If who they are growing is somebody the story demands--  I say they decide, it doesn’t really happen that way for me.  If when I’m writing the story I’m like “This character would not make this decision.  I either need to put in a new character in this place or I need to rebuild my outline to match who this person is.”  And both of those have happened to me.  Usually I’m not replacing the character except in the early parts.  Usually if I like the character enough as I’m going I replace the plot.

             <div>
              As I develop characters and they change over time, does that come naturally or do I have to force it?  For me it comes very naturally.  I do a lot of planning ahead of time on my plots and a /lot/ of planning ahead of time on my settings.  I do less on my characters.  I cast people in roles.  I start writing someone in this role and I see what becomes of them in the first few chapters and if I’m not liking that I put it aside and cast someone else in that role and write for a few chapters and then set that aside until I find a mix that I like and then it is a very natural progression as I write them.  That’s just the way that it works for me.  It’s a matter of practice making that happen.

             <div>
              How do I consistently create compelling magic systems?  Well you will maybe want to read Sanderson’s Three Laws of Magic, which are basically each essay on this.  The short answer is I look for something awesome and what that means is I look for something no one else is doing, or a ramification of a magic system that no one else is using and I extrapolate from it.  As a reader of fantasy, who loved fantasy, and still does, for many years I got very tired of seeing the same two or three magic systems in every book that I read.  It was really frustrating to me as a writer because I felt fantasy should be the most imaginative genre, it should be the most distinctive and different.  And so it was bothersome to me that there weren’t enough people doing interesting things with magic and so I just started doing it myself.

              Did I ever consider going back to one of my previous books and doing a prequel or expanding the world?  Yes, I will be doing these things.  The Cosmere Sequence.  So if you are not familiar my epic fantasy books, so anything that doesn’t mention Earth, they’re all set in the same universe.  So Elantris, and Mistborn, and Way of Kings, and they all have crossover characters that you can spot if you look really closely, that are interfering.  So there will be some parallel stories that show what some of these other people were doing behind the scenes.  There will be a series that starts it all off, long before the first books happen, and then there will eventually be--  Mistborn kind of forms the core of this.  I pitched Mistborn to my editor as an epic fantasy trilogy, followed by an urban fantasy trilogy, followed by a science fiction trilogy--a science fiction trilogy where they’ve learned to use the magic system to make space travel possible.  That was my original pitch.  The Alloy of Law was actually a happy accident, and so we’ve added a fourth one in, an early industrial era.  I’m actually doing four of those, because I really fell in love with them.  So you’ll be getting two more of those, one in September or October and then one in January.  And then the final Reckoners book should come sometime early next year like probably April or May and then the new Stormlight book will be in the fall.  So yay Stormlight.  *cheers*

              So if you had a character in Wheel of Time who was in the cosmere, who would that be?
Jain Farstrider?

             <h4>

             <div>
              Oh Jain?  That’s a good choice!  Jain makes a lot of sense.  I was going to say one of the Aelfinn or Eelfinn, ‘cause they cross dimensions already.  That would be the most likely.  But you could totally make an argument for Jain or one of the Heroes having fallen through the portal.  I intentionally didn’t put any cosmere references into the Wheel of Time.  It felt like hubris to do that.  The cameo in the Wheel of Time for me is the sword that Robert Jordan’s cousin gave to me out of Robert Jordan’s collection, so I wrote my sword into it.  So if you look, it’s not too hard to find, you’ll find Rand gets a new sword.  That’s my sword.  *laughter*  I got it hanging on my wall with a little plaque that says “Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time” and then Robert Jordan’s name and his lifespan underneath.  It’s very cool.  It’s a katana out of his collection, it’s really cool.

              I always like to read something that is unpublished.  So that is something new that you get only by coming to my signings  or going to the internet where people will have inevitably posted it online already.  *laughter*  It’s really exclusive for like the first signing that I do and then after that everybody on the 17th Shard, which is the fan website, are like *hilarious “oooh” sound*
No… I have to be very careful about what I read because the publisher has certain deals about exclusivity on new releases.  Like for instance I can’t read any more from the new Mistborn books because Apple has an exclusive release of new material on that and things like that.  It’s just part of the deals that we do and so--  I also have to make sure that it’s not making big spoilers for other books.  I have to make sure that it’s not containing errors that are glaring continuity errors and things like that.  So we are going to read from a novella called Perfect State.  This is a novella that I wrote oh about two years ago now and I didn’t really L--  get it done.  Like I wrote it and then there was something wrong with it and I wasn’t sure what it was.  I actually finished it a couple months ago.  I finally figured out what it was that was wrong.

              Yeah, at this point in my career I have the ability to have a little more influence over that.  I do try to keep to kind of a regular schedule.  My publishers have learned I’ll turn in what I’ll turn in, and then they’ll publish it.  Because I am more productive if I can jump between things.

              I’m a graphic designer and I want to know how you visually communicate-- You have such great visuals in your books...Do you draw them all?  Or do you just tell someone what you need?

              Lots of practice.  It really is just practice.
So I have artists.  I commission concept art for my descriptions and then… That doesn’t always end up in the book.  In fact usually it doesn’t.  For the things that end up in the book I’ll often do like a quick sketch and say “make this awesome” or I’ll do a paragraph or two of description.

              It’s usually the research I do.  Like when I’m like “I need to get in the mindset of /this/ type of person” and I go read about it.  I see the world in a different way after I become immersed in that.

               Jasnah was very hard originally, and that took a lot of research into the mindset of people who think differently from myself.  In the Wheel of Time books Aviendha and Tuon are both very different cultures so getting into those.

               No, Mat blindsided me.  Mat I thought would be easy because Perrin and Rand were and I grew up with Mat, Perrin, and Rand, right?  But the thing is Mat is a really hard character to write, meaning actual-- you look at him, he says one thing, he does a second thing, but he /thinks/ a third thing.  And so there is a lot of contrast to him and I just started writing him naturally and I wasn’t getting all of that contrast because I was like “Oh I know who Mat is.  Mat’s my--” But he was saying the things that he never said, if that makes sense?  I got his actions right but I flipped what he said and what he thought.  It was actually really hard to get him down.

               Yes, it’s like “I’m going to avoid trouble”, he runs into trouble, and he’s thinking all the way about something completely separate, and then something else leaves his mouth.

              I’m a physical chemist and I’m reading your book [TWoK] right now and at some point you have someone studying flamespren and what they saw, that’s one of the fundaments [sic] of quantum mechanics--So you got that from quantum mechanics?

               Well the Way of Kings magic systems are based on the fundamental forces.  That was the original idea and the extrapolation from them.  I’m fascinated by quantum mechanics and I have worked them into the way that-- Remember in my worlds, my books, the magics are a new branch of physics, in these worlds.  And so they interact with our normal physics, it’s not like they are ignoring them, so they obey the laws of thermodynamics, even when they appear to be breaking them, and they interact with quantum and all the stuff.  It’s just very natural that they are going to, to me if that makes sense?  It would be weird if they didn’t interact with them.

              Being religious myself I am fascinated by religion in all of its different forms.  So I constantly find myself returning to religious concepts and dealing with them in my books.  I don’t look to put any sort of message into my books, I look to create characters who feel real and let them determine what the message of the book is, does that make sense?  What they are passionate about.  So what you get from the books will depend on which characters you empathize with.

              I would say most of the time I have them at the beginning but sometimes during the writing I rebuild my outline to do something different.

              The Wheel of Time pilot?  I… think… See this is kind of on the record because of the recording.  I think the actors and the director are to be praised for doing so much with so little time.  I don’t think it should have been made and I don’t think it is a good direction for the Wheel of Time to be going.  But that is in part because I know Harriet was not pleased with it.

              Most that I wish I could have gotten into the Wheel of Time?  My favorite sequence that got cut, writing-wise, was the sequence where Perrin travels in the Ways and defeats Machin Shin with the Ogier.  It’s a beautiful sequence, it came out really well.  The problem is reading the book you don’t miss it because it was a big deviation.  So I’m not sure if I wish that one would have made it into the book.  I tried to get Rand engaged, and that one I think-- I think as a whole a lot of people are confused when they come to me and wish that they could have known a little bit more about that relationship and I tried to have the three-- I tried to write a scene where the three women weave a bridal wreath together to give to him and Harriet did not like that scene because she thought it might contradict Rand later wondering if any of them would follow him, which is a scene that Robert Jordan wrote.  I didn’t think it contradicted but since we had that scene from Robert Jordan and since Harriet-- she’s the boss, I was happy to cut it according to her wishes.  I miss that one.

              I would say… that my process is I write the first draft and I do a second draft where I am fixing the problems that I recognized on my first draft.  Then I do a third draft where I try to clean up the prose, that’s just making the writing line by line better.  I try to cut 10% and I just try to take each line and make it tighter.  At that point I send it off.  But I generally send it-- At that point I send it to my alpha readers, which are my agent and editor for me.  If you are doing it I would suggest giving it to a round of readers from friends first.  Get feedback from them, then do one more draft and then send it off.

              I grew up in Nebraska, Lincoln, and Chicago was the big city we would travel to.  I liked that it was-- This is kind of going to sound weird but it was a big city full of mid-westerners.  Like when I went to LA everyone talked and acted different, when I went to New York everyone talked and acted different, but in Chicago it-- they were kind of like a bunch of hokey mid-westerners had somehow built a big city?  *laughter* If that makes any sense.  So I have always had a fondness for Chicago.  It’s like the big city of farmers or whatnot.  I don’t know there’s just something about it, the being on the lake and the profile of it and things like that.  And I’m a Batman fan and Gotham is Chicago.  Chicago was my go-to when I was going to destroy a city in our world; I picked Chicago.

              I really enjoy the systems of religion and the religious questions that you bring up and so I was wondering--  Well first whether in your worlds there is a relationship between the efficacy of religion and the efficacy of magic?

              There is but the relationship is not a direct one-to-one parallel.  In other words the beings that are worshiped have an influence over the magic.  Whether they are actually God is disputed by various people.  And there are people who worship things that are not the various beings the magic is--  Does that make sense?

             <div>
              Yes.  Also what is it about about the Fantasy genre in particular that lends itself to these sorts of questions about the nature of religion?
It’s the same reason why I like Star Trek, you can kind of create a scenario and--
             </div>
             <h4>
              Brandon Sanderson
             </h4>
             <div>
              Well I think that there are a lot of things.  One of them is that fantasy is one of these genres where we can take away a lot of the contemporary baggage.  For instance, since it is hard to talk about things like the Catholic Church and the religion without getting into the social issues in our world right now, but if you create a fake religion that you can narrow down and focus on one aspect of it--  Fantasy is really good at that.  Tolkien did it with racism, let’s have an elf and a dwarf and have them interact, and take away all the baggage of civil rights era America or England and instead said “let’s see if these two races can get along”
But I also think that because of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis having such an influence on the genre you can do Good vs Evil, which lends itself.  Like Robert Jordan’s works there’s no religion there’s just a lot of spirituality.  So there is no religion because people can actively check and see if God is real, the Creator.  The magic is there, it’s the proof, they don’t /need/ a religion.  Which is a really interesting way to approach it.

              The names are actually really hard because comic book heroes, there are so many names they’ve already used.  And so I have to a lot of searching and thinking and it’s usually my fifth choice.  Lots of looking in the thesaurus for “alright was a word that is like this one that has been used way too often”.  The powers I’m look for usually something cool that somebody has done in a movie or a book or a comic book that I don’t think they extrapolated far enough.  I’m like “No that’s not how it would really work.  This is how I think it would really work” and kind of taking my own spin on it.

              What it takes is a lot of general knowledge, meaning you read a lot of history books, a lot of science books, and this general knowledge that you then incorporate.  It’s not like I go and say “I need to know more about this thing”.  I’ll do that for characters and some aspects of the worlds sometimes but mostly this is coming from spending 10 years learning all this stuff.  Does that make sense?

              Oh yes.  I don’t change it.  I’m just like “There’s a smart person.”  But what I learned in Wheel of Time fandom was that you can’t--  There is madness that lies in trying to change things once someone figures it out.  Like particularly with the way that I do my plots, there’s foreshadowing so there’s someone who’s going to be able to figure it out.  If they /can’t/ figure it out I haven’t put in the foreshadowing properly.  So almost everything that I’ve put into the books, /somebody/ knows.  Some of them are really obvious and everybody’s got it, and I’m okay with that because the people who don’t read the forums, a few of them will be surprised, but mostly it will be like “Yeah of course we know this Brandon.  Of course we know yada yada yada” I don’t--I don’t *mutters* I think you’ve figured it out--  But there are things like that.  But there are other little things that there are a dozen theories on, and one of them’s right.

              I was curious Mat and then the second-hand man Talmanes…  Did you have inspiration for those--  Because I absolutely enjoyed, I laughed out loud multiple times reading those characters.  And I wondered--

             <div>
              With Mat it was always just me trying to match Robert Jordan’s style, sometimes awkwardly at first but I think I got it down.  With Talmanes there was more room for interpretation because I had always--  In fandom people interpret his personality in a lot of different ways, and I was a certain theory because we’d never seen through his eyes.  When I did write scenes through his eyes I used my interpretation.  There are some people “No that’s not how he is”.  There are some people “Yes I always knew he was like that”.  But that’s how I’ve always viewed him, with kind of the tongue in his cheek as he’s talking to Mat.  And I’ve always loved him as a character because of that.  Which is why I wanted to write him and include him.  There weren't any notes to use him.

              I, personally, love that they are available but I find them kind of distracting when I’m listening to them. Yeah.  I’m glad--  I mean I want to sell as many of them as we can because there are some people who just love them.  But I actually love straight reads, like I like Wil Wheaton’s reading, where there’s very minimal voices.

              When it comes to major, pivotal plot twists.  Moments where the reader goes “WOAH” or “Oh my god”.  Are those something you write as starting point or ending point?

              What I do is I plot my outline backward, starting with those scenes.  And then I write the book forward to those scenes.  The reason I can do it that way is because in the plot I don’t need to know the characters’ emotional state, I can just come up with “This is going to be a great scene”.  But I have to have been with the characters through the journey to write their reaction to the scene.  So I can’t actually write it early.

              Yes, I have.  There have been a couple of them.  There’s one at the end of Words of Radiance, when it came time for the paperback I reverted to a previous version of the scene.  So yeah you guys will see that when the paperback comes out.  One of the ending scenes-- It’s a very minor tweak but I had done like four different drafts of this scene and I didn’t like the one we ended up with.  Even immediately after we sent it in I was like “No that’s the wrong one”.  So we reverted.

               Yeah.  The other thing is the ending of Elantris, the spatial-ness of it, and things, I got some of the math wrong.  I didn’t have Peter back then.  And so now that we are doing a 10th anniversary edition I actually had Peter and Isaac, who does all the maps, get together, work out the actual math.  The size of the city, the size of the continent, and all this stuff and Isaac’s doing a new map and we are changing the text to now match that map.  So for instance where it says something is in the original text it will actually move now that we have an actual real map, rather than my MS Paint thing that I was using ‘cause you know me and maps.  So yeah you nodded, there are a lot of mathematical-- just problems.  We’ve got the new map now and it all works.  So I’m glad that it all actually works, once you get the math right.  But like the number of steps is way off at the end of that one for instance.  [To Argent/Kurk] Have you guys figured that out?  Like it makes the size of the planet stupidly big.

              If forced to, because I would stay here if I could ‘cause internet, internet’s really cool, mac &amp; cheese, I like mac &amp; cheese, I like instant ramen.  But if I were forced I would pick Scadrial, the Mistborn world, because it’s the closest to all of those things, but beyond that it would, post-Catacendre, a very good place to live...

              I was wondering about , how much of your day do you spend writing?  Because you have five(?) books coming out, I didn’t count them all.

             <div>
              No, I’ve only got two books this year.  I do two books a year, with a third book occasionally.  It just depends on how long the books are.  For instance a Way of Kings book is four of these [Firefight?] in length, so when I do a Stormlight book you get less, fewer other books.  When I do-- For instance I can do two of these [Reckoners?] and two Mistborn books in the same length of time.  I work a normal workday usually, plus a little bit…  I don’t write particularly fast.  I do write a large amount but mostly I’m very consistent.  I just write a little bit each day and then it happens.

              That’s partially a RAFO.  Remember that healing in the cosmere usually has to do with how you view yourself.  And as long as there is some outpouring of Investiture you are usually capable of healing.  More the weird thing is not that Kaladin healed it’s that Szeth couldn’t.

              So this is going to require the soul being ripped apart, so it depends on what pieces of the soul are left and how easily you can capture them.  That’s a theoretical possible-- possibility… Know that most of the horrors of Dakhor are twisting a soul not stealing a soul.

              No, the symbols before the chapters are the same symbols as in the first book from a different era.  Same thing for the third book, they are the exact same symbols from a different era.

              It’s a combination of several things.  One is I started with wanting a group of powers that would complement a gang of thieves.  So I designed the powers to work within the roles of a thieving crew.  The burning metals came from reading about biology and metabolism and it felt very natural to me because that’s how we get our energy as human beings.  The whole connection of the metals and the visualization stuff came from mixing the periodic table of the elements with alchemy.  All of those things kind of spun together to make it.

              I-- Not really.  Now I did have two sisters, which helped, but my sisters were not raised in such a manner.  It is more just trying out personalities, like I talked about in my speech until I got one that worked.  Lots of practice if you want to be a good writer, lots and lots of practice.  Try writing people very different from yourself and try to get them right.  Give it to people and have them see if anything “Yes this feels right” and things like that.  Just do lots of practice.

               Yes, I would love to do a big cross-media sort of deal.  Whatever I can get away with, right?  So we’re doing a White Sand comic book right now, you probably know about that.  White Sand, my unpublished novel, we’re doing a graphic novel of that.  I’m working hard to get the movies made, I will do anything I can get made.  Just because I love storytelling in all its different weird varieties.

              You are releasing a graphic novel version of White Sand, which one is going to be canon to the cosmere, the graphic novel or the novel you originally wrote?

             </h4>
             <div>
              Oh definitely the graphic novel.  The book I originally wrote has its problems, and I never released it.  The books don’t become canon until I release them.  This will be the canon release of White Sand.  I don’t think-- If the graphic novel does well we are not going to write novels, I’m going to do the second one as a graphic novel original.  That’s just how we are going to do it-- is my plan right now.  There are things when we went back to it that we tweaked, for instance Hoid’s appearance in the original novel was only a reference.  He was mentioned by, what did I end up calling him, Eis? Ais, I had both names for a while, it was only a reference to one of his old cases, that’s his only appearance.   And we’re like “Ehh people are going to expect more now”.  So we are writing in a better appearance for him.  Stuff like that, I feel Khriss’ character needs better development than the novel had, so we are working on that.  Stuff, you know. Things you would do in a major revision.

              Yeah, we will eventually do-- Tor really wants to do a collection of all the cosmere novellas.  So like… [Brandon stumbles over the words] Shadows for Silence, The Emperor’s Soul, Sixth of the Dusk.  But I was trying to say Shadows for Silence but I almost said Shadows of Self, that’s going to be a problem for me going forward, using Shadows in two.  But all of those in one collection is what we’re probably going to see.

               I always think about that and I was wondering if you were worried about going that sci-fi fantasy route?  Like for instance--

               I’m not worried about it, I’m just excited…  In my mind all of my books are sci-fi as well as fantasy because I’m making weird new branches of physics and trying to adhere to as many of the laws as I can.

              Do you set out to write a specific-- like a teen book or an adult book?  Or are they just--

             <h4>

             <div>
              I usually do set out these days.  Originally I was not as cognizant of it, but I do think keeping audience in mind is an important attribute of writing.  The thing is when you are doing a teen book its not about writing down it’s about dealing with issues, like it’s the type of conflicts that really make something a teen book in my opinion.  And those conflicts can transcend into adult books but-- I don’t know it’s just there’s a feel for it.

                --than Stormlight.  So when you are holding the Breath it doesn’t expire when you put it in something it doesn’t go away.  Can you tell me something about why that’s happening?

                Part of this is kind of inherent to the Shard and the power it’s coming from.  I mean the power of Endowment is just going to stick, that’s part of the nature of its magic.  Does that make sense?   But it also kind of has to do with how the ecosystems are working.  For instance the Stormlight is essential to the ecosystem of Roshar, it needs to be expended, it needs to get out and--  It’s like evaporation, does that make sense?

                 Yeah, yeah like the cycle of water.  And so just part of the way the nature of it works, it /has/ to get out, it /has/ to leak out, it has to run out.  I mean it leaks even from spheres, right?

                    Vegetable...  More calories is going to equal more.  But the better comparison would be a sausage and bread.  Because bread is a fast blood sugar spike and the sausage is not.  And that’s how I’m working in my head.  It’s kind of a magical version of a blood sugar spike and I have it happen to her faster than it could happen.  Like normally you eat a piece of bread and your blood sugar spikes in a half hour, it’s going to go faster for Lift.

                 Oh I don’t write screenplays, it’s a different skill.  I think you do an expert do what an expert does.  But so far they have sent me all of the stuff they’ve done and I’ve given feedback and they’ve taken it.  It’s a good sign.

              No, but every time we are on a panel we are like “AH we should write a book together.”  It’s highly unlikely, that we would ever do anything together.  Just because our writing styles are so different.  Pat’s writing process-- It’s not so much style it’s the writing process-- is so different.  But you can hold out hope.  Perhaps some day I will have a pitch for Pat or something like that.  But I would hate to inconvenience his fans by distracting him with something else.

                   And are there like, median Cognitive ideals that gradually kind of influence these, or--

                   Yeah, they transcend between the three.  I mean the original concept for the three realms is Platonic philosophy.

                    </h4>
                    Yeah, it goes up and it comes back down.  A lot of the Cognitive is-- So like, the Cognitive has a bigger effect on how you can heal and things like that.  Does that make sense?
                    <div>
                     <h4>
                      Kurkistan

                     Yeah.

                     </h4>
                     But the power to heal is a actually a spiritual thing.
                     <div>
                      <h4>
                       Kurkistan
                      </h4>
                      So it's like the spiritual says "I want to be like this" and the Cognitive is like "okay I'll try really hard to be like that, but I have a limit."

              This is more of a--  For you to interface with the magic, you need to be able to comprehend it. And so forming a Command--  The same thing happens in Elantris, you know they don't accidentally draw runes, right?  The intention is part of interfacing with the magic.  So it's like your mind reaching into the spiritual realm and you have to like conceive something.

              Yeah, you want the Ghostblood symbol.  I think this is the one we settled on, but Isaac has final say on art things.  So you might have the one that was the one before we settled on one.

              My question has to do with the color of Shallan’s eyes currently, because we’ve noticed over the books that Kaladin’s eyes, as he’s continued to use his Surge, changed to lighter and lighter blue.  Whereas one could argue that Shallan is farther in her Ideals than Kaladin is, yet her eyes have not changed at all.

                No.  It is not.  It is just kind of the way that the changes the Stormlight is making the body and certain people are already descended from people who had repeated, over time, changes by the body which stopped physically… That’s not to say that all lighteyes that’s where they came from.  There are some that are natural mutations.

              I am very convinced that Adolin, with the events that happen with the last book.  You’re sending him down a like a dark path.  Is he possibly going to be a-- Antagonist(?) protagonist(?)-- A bad, eventually?  Or is he--

              I’m going to say this, the things that Adolin did do not contradict some of the moralities on Roshar, in fact they follow them directly.  Some of the moralities on our planet would say what he did is the right thing to do.  I think treating it as a “dark path” is too reductionist to say.  There are people who would seriously argue, and they would have a good argument, that what Dalinar was doing by leaving Sadeas around was a good idea.  And then there are other people who would say “You know what Sadeas did was a challenge and it was rightly then responded to” and then there are people who would say it was absolutely immoral.  So, it depends on your philosophy.  What would Honor say?  Well, Honor’s dead, so-- *lots of laughter*  You know Honor would not have been behind that action, but Honor’s dead.

We were like “Wait a minute, you can do this for the same price or less?  Why are we doing this at her house?”

              It has changed, but really what we’re seeing is what happened in the States in the seventies, the States and the UK following Tolkien, is now happening in a lot of countries that it hadn’t happened in before.  Which is cool.  But it’s not just Game of Thrones, since the Lord of the Rings movies, it’s Harry Potter.  The last ten years are wakening fantasy.  See the thing about fantasy is we don’t find fantasy doing well in developing countries.  It’s kind of the thing where if you are going to be reading about knights and wizards, you are not going to be somebody who’s struggling for your bread each day.  You know what I mean?

               </h4>
               Yeah.  So you see for instance as countries transition out of that you see a lot of fantasy and things.  For instance it happened in Japan in the seventies.  It happened in the US even earlier.  It’s happening now in Brazil and Taiwan.  Those are two of the places where it is just appearing.  India, it’s just starting in India.  Mainland China hasn’t quite caught on yet but there’s hints that it is going to happen.  But it has been in Europe for quite a while.

                Yeah, I’m in 26 languages, or something like that.  But you can kind of use that as a map for the places that read-- you know.  Like the only South American country is Brazil, I don’t have any other distribution in South America.  Not a single country in Africa, except South Africa, the UK editions.  None of those.  Japan, China, Korea?  Yes.  Europe?  Almost everybody in Europe.

              I heard earlier, through people I know, that Syl will eventually develop her memories from before the Recreance.  Does that mean any spren that are alive currently have been alive for that long as well?  Or are they--

              Brandon Sanderson
             </h4>
             <div>
              Not necessarily.  Some spren-- The thing about spren is that when does the energy become conscious?  So yes they will have all existed before but at what point is consciousness attained.  That’s kind of their birth.  It happens much more rarely than it does on the other-- on the Physical Realm, like regular people and things like that.  But there can totally have been spren who have been born since then.  And they would count most of the spren that you see as not being alive, well not being born.  Not conscious.  What’s the word for the difference between humans and animals, it’s not just sentience, there’s another word.  Starts with a C.  Sapient, you’re right it starts with an S.

                Not necessarily.  I read a lot and I like science and I like philosophy and I like and things like this.  And those spark most of my ideas.  So yes in a term but I’m not like “Let’s do this subject”.  I would say Warbreaker, the big part of Warbreaker is the idea of sympathetic magic.  Which is the idea that like affects like, which is a very common type of magic throughout all cultures on the planet, on our planet.  When people believe in magic they believe in sympathetic magic.  A voodoo doll is sympathetic magic.  And that’s where the idea came from.

              The hardest part, I would say, was the battle logistics.

               Yeah, A Memory of Light is all battle logistics, it was really hard.  And the second half was really tough to get that all right.  And just to work with the assistants and things like that.

              I was wondering when you first thought to put Nightblood in Words of Radiance?

             <div>
              Nightblood in Words of Radiance happened because… So I wrote the original draft of Way of Kings in 2002 and Vasher was Kaladin’s swordmaster and I thought “This guy has a really interesting past, he’s not natively from Roshar”.  So I went and wrote his backstory and that became the book Warbreaker.  So he predates-- And then I came back and I re-wrote Way of Kings and I cut him out of it to save him for the later books.  So when did I first think of it?  Well 2003 probably?  Was where that was happening.

              I felt that one of the foibles of the large series epic fantasy genre is the tendency of authors to go afield down paths of side characters.  It happened to Robert Jordan, it happened to George R.R. Martin.  And so reading theirs I hoped to learn from them and say “I’m going to do this thing that gives me a pressure valve to tell these stories that are outside the main line but I’m not going to give myself enough room that I can just turn this into a full character, yet.”  That allows me to do goofy stuff around the world but have a form for it built into the book.

             <div>
              What you do with religions in your world, in your stories more generally.  [...] Tokien, he says his books are fundamentally Catholic works, but he never mentions religion explicitly.  It kind of just breathes religious air, is the way I describe it.  So like you address religion in your books with the characters, sometimes positively sometimes negatively.  How do you deal with that in your world and in your books, like with the air that they breathe kind of, to steal the metaphor?

             <div>
              Yeah I just-- The characters are everything to the books.  What they are passionate about becomes what the book is about.  For me my job in writing is to explore different sides of issues through the eyes of different people.  That said, who I am shapes what I am interested in and what ends up in the books.  I think at the end of the day I think you could call my books fundamentally Mormon books, in the way that Tolkien’s were fundamentally Catholic, because I can’t separate myself from my religion.  I am trying to explore the world through the eyes of people who see the world differently from the way I see it.

                So how then, does Mormonism affect, like you said-- In what way would you say your books are fundamentally Mormon?

                Well if the philosopher in me steps aside, and the writer in me just wrote what the writer is passionate about.  If the trained english major says-- One of the biggest fundamental tenets of Mormonism is deification of normal people, right?  Mormonism believes that we are gods in embryo and we are here to learn and have experience so we will be better in the afterlife, and growing and we’ll eventually-- Joseph Smith taught “What Man is God once Was, and what God is Man may Become” maybe not “will be” but “may become” That’s what he said.  And so if you look at my books there’s a whole bunch of deification going on, right?  That’s like fundamental to the cosmere is “What do people do with the power of the gods when they’re given it?”  And I would say that’s totally my upbringing that made me fascinated about that. Does that make sense?

                  Question

                 Yeah, i never thought about that.  Fantasy really lends itself to that.

                 </h4>
                 Yes, it does.  But I mean deification of a normal person is a very Christian tenet also, it’s just one person did it, and it was a person who was God before, but it is still part of that whole thing which is part of why I think Christianity and Fantasy ended up kind of hand in hand.

              Yes. So, it depends on the culture and things like that, what it’s going to be like. You can kind of bet in Mistborn it’s going to be French, if it’s from the central dominance.  So they’ll say “Kelsi-ay” and “Demou” but where Elend’s from is a lot more Germanic so “EE-lend” “Strahff” and stuff like that.  The other worlds are all going to have their things.  In Roshar you are going to get some of the “YAS-nah kho-LIN” [kho being a back of throat guttural sound, kind of like Scottish “ch” as in loch] it’s going to be a little more semitic in its language family.

              Yes.  When I went into the trilogy I actually asked them “Is there a character I can have to just do whatever I want with?” and they looked through for one Robert Jordan had left no notes on and they gave me Androl.  I went crazy... He was a little bit of a pressure valve, for me, being able to do the things I like to do in a novel, in the Wheel of Time, so I didn’t then take over other characters too much.  A bunch of me creeped into Perrin too but...

              Oh, no, they are not all going to be chronological.  Most of them have been chronological so far, but we are getting to the point where they’re stopping to be because like Way of Kings was before Alloy but now we’ve gone back and done Words of Radiance which is a jump backward and then we are going to be jumping to the next Alloy which is a jump forward.  I’m pretty sure that’s how it goes.

              Question

             <div>
              I know at the end of Words of Radiance Syl shows she can turn into different forms, not just a sword. Why do they not-- Or why do none of the other past Radiants really show that they have done that.  Because normally in the flashbacks they are shown just being swords.

              So the shardblades came from spren seeing the Honorblades, which were created for mankind, and being like “I can do that”.  That is what they were imitating.

               No, that’s how they see themselves and how they are seen.  They can change into other things--

                But when you let go of one it’s going to become a sword again.

                  Question

                 </h4>
                 That’s cultural, like this is-- One thing that is interesting is you are going to see that the new Radiants don’t have-- I mean the Radiants you have seen almost all of them are after thousands of years of Radiants and Orders and you have certain things that you do.  So the writing reason was I didn’t want to give away--
                 <div>
                  <h4>
                   Question

                  </h4>
                  There is a writing reason behind it.  I didn’t want to do that and give too much away.  I already worried that having Syl shift shapes as often as she did through the first book was going to be a big clue to people and I wanted to hold off on giving away too much.

                I’ve waited when I was younger, I don’t have to do it anymore, but when I was younger I waited this long for Orson Scott Card.  The thing is most authors these days I wouldn’t have to wait for, like most of them are my pals and things.  But there are some that aren’t.  Like if I could get my copy of Watchmen signed, I would wait for him.

              So you've said that healing is like the spiritual wants to heal and then it filters through the Cognitive, but how's that work with healing wounds to the soul like Hemalurgy or Shardblades? What do you refer to to heal the soul at that point?

              You need to make a patch on the soul with investiture.

                Kurkistan

               So how's the investiture know where to go, what to look like?

               Well your soul is an ideal. So if you can get it up there, there are ways to do- to recreate that with um- see I'm getting into stuff for later books.

                 So when Hemalurgy rips something off the soul, is that the ideal soul or some sub-soul?

                 That is off of your soul, and it can be healed; but what it's going to be doing is creating a patch of new soul. So it will not be your original soul. Does that make sense?

So they’ve evolved to the point where this sort of thing-- It would be like trying to power DC with AC current or the wrong voltage or something like that… I mean once you figure it out it could be an easy hack but finding out that hack it’s like-- You know it’s like going back to people in the 1800’s and being like “Why don’t you guys have electricity?” *laughter*

               So what's up with frame of reference for time bubbles; in that obviously if you make a bubble and it's still it's not really still, like time moves differently but-

               <h4>
                Brandon Sanderson
               </h4>
               We deal with that a little bit in Era 2 Book 2 [Shadows of Self], where we talk about the fact that you know- obviously the bubble is moving with the planet. So they're not-- the frame of reference is not absolute.

                And so we talk about sorta' the idea of mass and momentum and time bubbles and things like that.

                  Brandon Sanderson

                 For instance you can make a time bubble on a train.
                 <div>
                  <h4>
                   Kurkistan

                  Oh and it stays on the train?!

                 <div>
                  <h4>
                   Brandon Sanderson
                  </h4>
                  Yes, but when you start catching stuff off of the train, it's gonna' jar each time, and it's probably going to ruin your time bubble, right?
                  <div>
                   <h4>
                    Kurkistan

                   So does it get it's "anchor" from-- it's asking all the things that are within it what they think "still" is?
