               (and even earlier) come to a head in

               Well, it's not so much that I'm ready to be done with it, as—I think I can do it in a shorter book than that—but, you know, I set out in this thing thinking it's a 10K run, maybe a 15K, and suddenly I found out I was in a marathon. Now, if you're running a marathon, running a good 20-mile time or a good 22-mile time is all very well, but it doesn't count until you cross the finish line.

               That's exactly right. People want to know where you're going with that. And you know, you say you wrote a marathon, but actually I think you've

               the marathon. There's a lot of people trying to keep up writing series that go this long and have this kind of following.

               Well, you know, the series going this long is a matter of me undertaking to tell more story than I thought I was setting out to tell. In the beginning, I really thought I could do it in five or six books. By the time I finished
               <i>
                The Great Hunt
               </i>
               I knew five or six books....it wasn't going to happen, but I didn't know how many, and for a number of books, I was frankly pulling numbers out of the air. People would ask me how many it would be, and I'd say six or seven, maybe eight, eight or nine. [laughter] Now I think I can finish it in a twelfth book, and I certainly intend to do so if I can. I believe I can.

               No. I had the major events. I had the opening events in the Two Rivers, I had the final scene, I've had the way things were going to wrap up, and I had major events in between those two. And I thought I could tell that story—get from one event to another—and change these people in the way they needed to be changed so that the people in those first scenes would become the people in the last scenes. I thought I could do that all in five or six books, but even with
               <i>
                The Eye of the World
               </i>
               , I had certain things I wanted to do in that book, and I realized before I reached the end, I could not do them all. And that was the book took four years to write; it was the longest of them all, because I realized as I was writing it that I had more to work out than I had thought in the beginning.

               When you were exploring these new things that needed to be worked out—obviously you focus much on character development and tell the story of the people there—but were there also events that kind of cropped up which kind of seemed like a good place to take the story, and that's also caused some of the diversion?

               No. I've stuck pretty much to the events that I had listed, although in some cases I've done away with some because I realized there was a better way to do what I wanted to do, to effect the change in the character. There was a more economical way to do it, and something that perhaps made more sense in terms of the story, the way it was going.

               Now, since you have basically...you had a beginning and you knew where the end was, and you said you had these points in here. Don't you feel as though maybe you may have locked yourself into a path that you could have explored different directions or different paths? Do you have any regrets to locking yourself into that and not giving yourself the freedom to go where the story takes you?

               No. No, because I knew where I wanted the story to take me. If you're a writer, you

               that; you control it. I like to say I am an Old Testament God with my fist in the middle of my characters' lives. If you just sit down and start writing and see where it takes you...well, God knows if it's ever going to take you to a story that's worth anything.

               It's not frightening. It's very exciting. For about ten years, I've been bouncing around ideas in the back of my head. Nothing on paper, but quite a bit in the back of my head, as to what I will do when I finish Wheel of Time. I have a good bit of that already planned out. A trilogy, actually two sets of trilogies, to be called Infinity of Heaven.

               I have had the same editor for every book that I have ever written with one exception. My wife Harriet is my editor. As a matter of fact, our professional relationship predates our marriage, predates our going together even. She was the editor and publisher of my first novel—
               <i>
                The Fallon Blood
               </i>
               , a historical novel—and it was after that was published that we began dating.

               We'll leave that for speculation. We're not going to try and answer that question right here, Robert. If you don't mind, Robert, we'll take a very short break. We'll come right back and continue our conversation. We're chatting with Robert Jordan. The new book in the Wheel of Time is out, kids. It's called
