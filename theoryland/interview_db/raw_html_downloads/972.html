									<p>Hello WoT fans!</p>

<p>Memory Keeper Bill Tracy, aka Mandamon, here (via Jaimie Sedai), reporting on the third-to-last signing for <i>A Memory of Light</i> that took place in Raleigh, North Carolina, on February 20th. We were lucky to have both Brandon and Harriet with us.</p>
 
<img src="http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/uploads/gallery/album_307/sml_gallery_26675_307_23934.jpg" width="300"></img></p>

<p>We convened at <a href="http://www.quailridgebooks.com/store-info">Quail Ridge Books and Music</a>, a fantastic independent bookstore that has been serving the Raleigh community for nearly thirty years, and is well known to locals and students at the nearby North Carolina State University. Quail Ridge Books is unique in that it acts as a meeting place for writers of all ages—both new and seasoned. They have a large space available for books signings, and it was certainly needed this night!</p>

<p>The lucky fans Chosen (pun fully intended) by Dragonmount for this event were Gary Singer (our "First Among Equals"), Gary Kellum, Kerri Cushing, Tom Burchhardt, Jaimie Krycho, Oliver Gatchalian, Joel Abney, and myself. Seven of us met twice before the signing to go over the schedule, test our recording equipment, and generally nerd out, and the eighth joined us at the signing itself, as he had to make a two-hour drive. We instantly bonded and had a lot of fun discussing both WoT and Brandon's own works.</p>
 
<p><img src="http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/uploads/gallery/album_307/sml_gallery_26675_307_67103.jpg" width="300"></img></p>

<p>Before the signing, the Memory Keepers all arrived several hours early, but some fans still had us beat! We saved our front-row seats, flapped books, set up the event area, and giggled delightedly about what would happen that night.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/uploads/gallery/album_307/sml_gallery_26675_307_3606458.jpg" width="300"></img></p>
 
<p>Brandon and Harriet's flight got in a little late, but they were right on the ball, sitting down to sign several hundred pre-ordered and first edition books, as well as the Memory Keepers' books, all while answering questions. It takes quite the multitasking skills to write a quote in a copy of <i>A Memory of Light</i> while answering hard questions posed by avid fans! Many of the fans' question are included at the end of this post, but everything up to then will remain spoiler-free.</p>

<p>We were only able to blast questions at the two for about thirty minutes before we had to reluctantly give them up to the hundreds of other fans waiting in the store, who clapped and cheered as Brandon and Harriet entered the room.</p>

<p>Oliver initiated the live stream for Dragonmount as René, event coordinator at Quail Ridge, laid the ground rules for the signing. Tom then introduced Brandon and Harriet with a moving speech about the influence that WoT has had on its readers.</p>

									<p>Brandon then came up and spoke. Here are some of the highlights:</p>

																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>"I read the WoT books all through my career, and all through college. I loved them, and at times hated them. Anyone else remember when Book 6 came out and it wasn't the end? I was not happy. I went through everything WoT fans seem to go through—the appreciation, and the transition from waiting for the ending to just letting Robert Jordan do what he wants to do.</p>

<p>In 2007, when he passed away, I was as surprised as anyone was. For me, I became a fantasy author in part because of my love for his books. I learned to write novels by reading his books, and I chose my publisher because it was the one that published the WoT books. So it was the end of an era. We talk about the end of the Third and the start of the Fourth—well the end of that age for me was when Robert Jordan passed away. I didn't think for a minute I would be here, five years later. It has been an amazing journey, and the last five years have been unparalleled.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how awesome it was to look through [Jordan's] notes and see things in the middle of their progress. As a writer, I haven't grown as much since writing my first book. It was amazing and wonderful, but over it all there was this cloud, that I couldn't have done this if my favorite author hadn't passed away. People ask me how I feel; it's a weird mix of emotions. It's probably similar to the emotions you will have reading the last page [of <i>A Memory of Light</i>]. It's wonderful and awesome you got to be part of this, but now it's done, and there's sadness. It's like Christmas: you've opened all your presents, and now what?"</p>									</div>

<p>Harriet is one of the most awarded editors in science fiction and fantasy, and has been throughout her career. She edited <i>Ender's Game</i>, she discovered Robert Jordan and WoT, and the she married Jordan to make sure her editorial advice got taken.</p>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									<p>My question is, are you going to tell which scenes are entirely yours and which are entirely Jordan's?</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I'm avoiding a lot of detail until people have a chance to read the books. I'll repeat what I said before. In <i>The Gathering Storm</i>, if it was Egwene, a lot of those scenes were Robert Jordan. If it was Rand, a lot of those scenes were me. In <i>Towers of Midnight</i>, if it was Mat, a lot of those scenes were Jordan, and if it was Perrin, it was more me. Mat in <i>The Gathering Storm</i> was me. The Mat in <i>Towers of Midnight</i> was more Jordan, but a few scenes were me.</p>

<p>I can spin this into a larger story. I've been reading the books for 23 years. When I picked up the series, I had read <i>Eye of the World</i> 8 or 9 times. When each of us read a book, we bring something to it and reinforce that when we read. I have a friend who insists Thom Merrilin doesn't have a moustache. I can point out the page where it says he does and my friend says, "That line doesn't exist in my copy." This is part of the power of fiction. This is what I love about fiction. We write a script which you direct in your head. Readers have different perspectives on how much freedom they have for changing that. I say you have line item editing capability&mdash;you change it how you want and that's how I've always read.</p>

<p>When I came on this project, I had a lot of baggage&mdash;17 years of baggage, and I had to have some of it beaten out of me! There are various things, like some of my pronunciations. There are other things, like Tar Valon. I did not view the bridges as being as big as they are. From my perspective, you can stand on one side and see the other. No, they're like 3 miles long! They're just enormous. They are things like that I've imagined since my youth. There are some characters I interpret a certain way, and I don't think others would interpret them that way. I've tried to interpret the characters, I believe, the way Robert Jordan did, but we can argue all day on how he interpreted them, and that's what I think people don't understand. We can have a distinct argument on how he interpreted and we would both be right.</p>

<p>I interpreted Mat a certain way and I believe I got better at writing Mat as I went along. Mat was a really hard character because he's so complicated. What's so hard about him is that, from a narrative, he's one of the few characters in WoT whose thoughts and actions are at a disconnect. Perrin, the way he thinks and acts are in line. He doesn't [do] the same thing Mat does, where he has this big thing in his head and opens his mouth and a completely different thing comes out, and they're both hilarious. But they're at a contrast with each other in their hilarity. And this is something where if you read WoT, you see Jordan develop this character and come up with this sort of awesomeness that is Mat. And it took some writing for me to get Mat right.</p>									</div>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									<p>You said in <i>The Gathering Storm</i>, the Rand was very dark. Was his darkness in the book hard to write?</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Rand's darkness was certainly hard to write. But there's a piece of the writer that says when this is tough, that's good. One, you're pushing yourself. Two, if it's emotionally hard for you, and you're doing this the right way, it's going to be emotionally hard on the reader, and that's a sign that they will be emotionally invested. So yes, it was hard. How did I get into the mindset? The same way I do everything. There's actually a lot of method acting to writing, where you sit down and become that character for a time. Harriet has a story about Robert Jordan and how he did it. She could always tell.</p>

<h4>Harriet McDougal</h4> 
<p>I could generally tell when he came in for the evening news and supper whether he had been writing a good person or a bad person. In particular there was an evening when he came in and slammed the door, and was skulking around the wall like this [hunches up against the bookshelf behind her], and I said, "You've been writing Padan Fain, haven't you?" And he said, "How did you know?" Usually he came in and said "Hello, honey!"</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4> 
<p>So you get in the mindset and go, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and if it doesn't, you throw it away and start again the next day.</p>

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>No. I'm sorry about that, but as you all may know, Jordan expressed his horror of anyone writing in his universe. He said he would rent a semi and drive it back and forth over his hard disks before that happened. He made it clear in the last months that he did want them finished. But as for the outrigger novels, he only left one or two sentences, and there isn't enough of Robert Jordan for him to be present in those books in the way he would have wanted. The same with the prequels. I'm sure you’ve all seen <i>A Christmas Carol</i> and Marley shows up all in clanking chains? He'd come and get me!</p>

									<p>The one I'm reading at the moment. There's one guy who's a peddler in the Waste, and we sort of think he's a good guy, but he's not, he's perfectly awful, and he's thinking at one point about his sister, and how tragic it was when he had to kill her, and I thought about how he's just so beautifully drawn. My husband always made a point. Everybody thinks they're wonderful human beings, including him. Wasn't his fault&mdash;he had to do it. I just love that about each and every character, even that son-of-a-gun. I couldn't help loving him a little bit. Very human, but I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley.</p>

That was a lot of my life, especially during the first 3 years. During the last 2, we slowed down a little bit, just because it was so hard.

<p>The signing went until 11:30. All kinds of books came through the line, including Brandon's Alcatraz books, a few <i>Ender's Game</i>s, and some very old copies of Wheel of Time books with Robert Jordan's signature in it. One of the fans present was he and Harriet's limo driver from a long-ago tour!</p>

									<p>Getting back to <i>Callandor</i>, we know that you have to channel the appropriate power though a seed—<i>saidin</i> or <i>saidar</i>.

<p>I believe it was made intentionally to do what it did for a specific use. Not what it ended up being used for. I don't think it was used for that. I think it was built—you're going to have to clear it with Maria—I think it was built to be a trap for one of the male Forsaken.</p>

																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I don't believe that he does. Being a <i>ta'veren</i> has a distinct effect on him, but I think there is an innate luckiness to Mat, partially drawn from the fact that the Heroes [of the Horn] call him Gambler. And so in other lives where he would not have been <i>ta'veren</i> he was still a gambler and still lucky. However, I do think being a <i>ta'veren</i> meant that the luck was greatly magnified, and I think it grew stronger and stronger through the series. That's my read on it from the notes, and I'm pretty sure on that one. I have to give the caveat that there could be something out there that contradicts me.</p>

									<p>I can tell you that it did take place, and that Hawkwing is more inclined to agree with what's going on in Seanchan than I think what fans expect him to be. Now, remember that Hawking was not fond of Aes Sedai. Part of that was not his fault, but he was not fond of them. He is not just King Arthur, he is Alexander the Great. King Arthur ruled through justice. Artur Hawkwing ruled through justice and ruthlessness. It will certainly be a conversation filled with emotion and passion, but I don't think everyone expecting Hawkwing to take their side is understanding who Artur Hawkwing is.</p>
