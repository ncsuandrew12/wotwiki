									&#65279;&#65279;<p>In the world of fantasy <a href="http://www.brandonsanderson.com/">Brandon Sanderson</a> hardly needs an introduction—simply put, he is one of the most prolific and best selling fantasy authors around. He was already gaining popularity when he agreed to finish the Wheel of Time series for the late Robert Jordan and was propelled into the spotlight. Somehow while writing the final three Wheel of Time books he's managed to publish <i>The Way of Kings</i> (<a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780765326355/?a_aid=neth">Book Depository</a>, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780765326355">Powell's Books</a>, <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780765326355?aff=neth">Indiebound</a>, <a href="http://nethspace.blogspot.com/2010/08/review-way-of-kings-by-brandon.html">my review</a>), the first book in a planned 10-book series and his latest, <i>The Alloy of Law</i> (<a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780765330420/?a_aid=neth">Book Depository</a>, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780765330420">Powell's Books</a>, <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780765330420?aff=neth">Indiebound</a>), a stand-alone story set in the Mistborn (<a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780765365439/?a_aid=neth">Book Depository</a>, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780765365439">Powell's Books</a>, <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780765365439?aff=neth">Indiebound</a>, <a href="http://nethspace.blogspot.com/2009/01/mistborn-trilogy-by-brandon-sanderson.html">my review</a>) world several hundred years after the original trilogy. Here is the blurb and <a href="http://www.tor.com/features/series/the-alloy-of-law">a link to some sample chapters available on-line</a>:&#65279;&#65279;</p>

<blockquote>&#65279;&#65279;<p>Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity, with railroads to supplement the canals, electric lighting in the streets and the homes of the wealthy, and the first steel-framed skyscrapers racing for the clouds.&#65279;&#65279;</p>

<p>Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now part of history—or religion. Yet even as science and technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs, they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting to establish order and justice.&#65279;&#65279;</p>

<p>One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will.  After twenty years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs.&#65279;&#65279;</p></blockquote>

&#65279;&#65279;<p>And for those interested in the audio book, here is a nice sample for you to listen to.&#65279;&#65279;</p>

																		<div>
									<p>A few years ago <a href="http://nethspace.blogspot.com/2009/11/my-evening-with-brandon-sanderson.html">I had the privilege of meeting Brandon and spending a good bit of time with him</a> while he was touring for <i>The Gathering Storm</i>. He's a great guy and very easy to talk to. So, it was late one night when I finished reading <i>The Alloy of Law</i> and I was excited, I simply had to talk with someone about it (<a href="http://nethspace.blogspot.com/2011/11/review-alloy-of-law-by-brandon.html">my review is here</a>). So, I got on the computer&mdash;however this was over a month before the official release date, and not many people had read the book and certainly no one was talking publicly about it. Naturally, I thought that it'd be awesome to talk with Brandon about it&mdash;of course we all know how busy he is wrapping up the Wheel of Time. So, next best thing, I set up an interview with him with the help of his ever-faithful assistant, Peter. I love that a long-lasting blog comes with such privileges. Anyway, the interview below is the result and it's almost entirely focused on <i>The Alloy of Law</i>. Of course since I didn't really want to spoil the whole book, we don't discuss everything that I wanted to, but this should give a nice taste of what <i>The Alloy of Law</i> has to offer. Warning, question 4 contains spoilers for the original <i>Mistborn</i> trilogy (Brandon mentions as much so there is a second warning).</p>

<p>Thanks again to Brandon for taking time out of his busy schedule to answer these questions and thanks again to Peter for making it happen. Enjoy!</p>

																		<div>
									<i>The Alloy of Law</i> seems to have literally sprung up from nowhere. So, where did it come from? How has <i>The Alloy of Law</i> impacted your overall plans for events on Scadrial [the planet where the events of Mistborn occur]? Is it part of the original set of trilogies you had mapped out?
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>This may be new information to some readers, but I've mentioned several places before that the Mistborn series was pitched to my editor as a sequence of three trilogies. Past, present, and future—epic fantasy, urban fantasy, and science fiction; all with the running thread of the magic system.</p>

<p>Since I just started coming out with the Stormlight Archive, I want to commit myself to that and don't want to dig into the second Mistborn trilogy for quite a while. Yet I want to prep people for the idea that Mistborn is going to be around for a while, and they are going to be seeing more books. I didn't want it to just come out of nowhere at them in ten years or whenever I get to it. So I decided to do some interim stories.</p>

<p>One of the things I'd been playing with was the idea of what happened between the epic fantasy and the urban fantasy trilogies. We have some very interesting things happening in the world, where you've got a cradle of mankind created (by design) to be very lush, very easy to live in, so a great big city could grow up there relatively quickly; civilization could build itself back up over the course of just a couple of generations. Yet there would be very little motivation to leave that area at first, which I felt would mean that you'd end up with this really great frontier boundary. The dichotomy between the two—the frontier and the quite advanced (all things considered) city in the cradle of humanity—was very interesting to me. So I started playing around with where things would lead.</p>

<p>To worldbuild the urban fantasy trilogy coming up, I need to know everything that happened in the intervening centuries. Some stories popped up in there that I knew would happen, that would be referenced in the second trilogy. So I thought, why don't I tell some of these stories, to cement them in my mind and to keep the series going.</p>

<p>I started writing <i>The Alloy of Law</i> not really knowing how long it would be—knowing the history and everything that happened, but not knowing how much of it I wanted to do in prose form. Things just clicked as they sometimes do, and I ended up turning it into a novel.</p>									</div>

																		<div>
									<i>The Alloy of Law</i> has the feel of a Western with just a dash of Steampunk. Did you do a lot research into Westerns to try and figure out how one could fit into your world or was it more of an organic process? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>

									<p>I'd say more organic. I honestly don't look at it as much of a Western. The part that is in a Western setting, the prologue, is actually the last thing I wrote, feeling I needed a better introduction. Originally the story just started in the city.</p>

<p>As I said, I view it as a clash between these two concepts, the city and the frontier. Mistborn as a series has always been city-based, urban. I intend to keep it that way, mostly. The story here as I saw it was of the man who had been living out on the frontier for a long time who comes back and has to integrate into society. Which is another theme of the Mistborn books—just as in the original trilogy Vin had to go from the streets to upper society, I wondered what it would be like to deal with a character who had lived among the two-faced society of city politics and more or less rejected it, who gets pulled back against his will. So I would say it's less a Western and more a clash between that more simple, rugged lifestyle and the city lifestyle.</p>									</div>

									Wax is quite the archetype, complete with a side-kick and (potential) love interest. Where did he come from?

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>I don't generally sit down and say I'm going to write someone who's this archetype or that archetype. What I wanted for this book, honestly, was just to have fun. I love writing epic, awesome stories; I love stories that are full of deep character conflict and broad world-spanning conflict—but sometimes I just want to back away from that and have fun.</p>

<p>The Wax archetype with the sidekick—the two of them were built from the ground up to be characters who played off one another well to facilitate good banter. Because I like to write good banter. I like to read it, I like to enjoy it. Whether it's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, or Holmes and Watson or whatever—I get a kick out of these types of stories. So when I was writing this book, I was really just saying let's step back for a little while from the kind of stories I was writing with <i>The Way of Kings</i> and the Wheel of Time—which are both (I hope) very awesome, and deep, and complex—and let's do something that's just fun.</p>									</div>

									How has religion and mythology changed in the 300 years since the events of the Mistborn trilogy? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I had a bit of a challenge in this book because—and you may want to put a spoiler warning on this interview—at the end of the first Mistborn trilogy, one of the characters became the god of this world. He became a god figure, an almost omnipotent figure. I had planned this from the beginning, but it also offers a challenge, because in this world you have a real deity that is interacting, that is a character—not to say that in our world God doesn't interact with us, because as you know I am a faithful, religious person. However, I think there is a different interaction going here where the reader has spent time with this person as a character, and now he is a deity figure. So how to deal with this is one of the big challenges in worldbuilding this next several hundred years.</p>

<p>I wanted Sazed to be involved—I didn't want to just have him vanish and not be part of things. I wanted to acknowledge what happened with him and make it part of the mythology of the story. But at the same time, having one of your characters turn into God runs you right into the trouble of literal <i>deus ex machina</i>, once one of your characters has all of this power. So walking that line was both exciting and also very challenging.</p>

<p>I like to deal with religion in my books. I like to look at all aspects of it, and in this book I wanted to look at what it would be like if someone like Sazed had been put in this position and people started worshiping him—what do you do with that?</p>									</div>

									For those readers who read Mistborn years ago (or even not at all), what do they need to know before reading <i>The Alloy of Law</i>? Do you think this book is a good introduction to the world of Scadrial?

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<div>I honestly don't think you need to remember that much of the original trilogy, or even need to have read it at all, to enjoy this book. Granted, I drop some bombs on you in the epilogue—the epilogue and near ending of this book are deeply tied to the original trilogy, but the actual story of this book other than those after-the-fact bombs is very self-contained. Allomancy and Feruchemy are reintroduced; readers get some quick explanation of that. I think you can pick this up without having to read or reread the whole trilogy. </div>

<h4>Neth</h4> 
<div>High Imperial? And where was Hoid?</div>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<div><p>You will have to look. Hoid is in the book, though his name doesn't appear. But the things happening here during this interim are not of deep interest to Hoid like the things happening in the original trilogy, so he is playing a much smaller role here than he was in the original trilogy.</p>

<p>Also, High Imperial just cracks me up.</p></div>

									My understanding is that <i>The Alloy of Law</i> is intended to be more or less a stand-alone book. However, without giving too much away, it feels like there is a whole lot more of Wax's story to be told. When's the sequel coming? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									I will most likely write a sequel. However, what you've got to remember is that I will be writing that future trilogy, the urban fantasy trilogy. The events in this book are of relation to what's happening in the future, so you will find out eventually the answers to the questions this book gives you, even if a sequel to this book never comes. But I more than likely will write more of these books over the next few years. The Stormlight Archive is my main focus following the Wheel of Time; I don't want to leave people hanging too much where that's concerned. But between books I will probably write more about these characters.									</div>

									Since pretty much all fantasy fans are eagerly anticipating one story or another from you, let's do the obligatory update on your on-going projects. How is <i>A Memory of Light</i> coming? Stormlight Archive 2? <i>The Rithmatist</i>? Alcatraz? Are any other side projects about to unexpectedly see the light of day?
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>As of doing this interview, the last book of the Wheel of Time is nearly done, but boy, that's a big "nearly." There's so much work to do with the last chunk of this book that it's feeling pretty overwhelming right now. My goal is to have a revised manuscript in to Harriet by January 1st. When it comes out will depend on how long it takes to edit it.</p>

<p>The second Stormlight Archive book is in the planning stages; I should go right into writing that starting January 1st, with it coming out hopefully around a year after that, maybe March 2013. That's a long wait since <i>The Way of Kings</i> was released, and I hate to make people wait that much, but I plan to write the third book fairly soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Alcatraz is on hold until I decide what to do with the series. I will write one more book in that eventually. <i>The Rithmatist</i> is exciting; it's fun; but I also don't want to have too many balls up in the air that people are reading and having to keep track of. So I keep delaying it with Tor, saying we shouldn't release it until I'm sure I can commit to getting the trilogy done in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have a few random side projects in the works that should be coming your direction. I always have random side projects in the works, but none of those are ready for announcement yet.</p>									</div>
