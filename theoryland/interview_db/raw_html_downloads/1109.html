									When Shallan does Lightweaving, is that a combination of Illumination and Transformation, or is Lightweaving just of Illumination?

																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									Lightweaving is just of Illumination. Lightweaving is a long-established power in the cosmere. Very early books, in fact one of the very first stories I ever wrote, Lightweaving was the magic. (That story is unpublished, written long ago&mdash;long before Liar of Partinel) And so, this stems from my own personal affection for illusion and my feeling that it had not been used as well as I wanted it to be used in fantasy fiction. So I consider it only Illumination truly in <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>. 									</div>

									And the end of the series? Because the end of the series, um, we have a 15-year gap between [books] 5 and 6. So, the first five will probably be Wheel-of-Time-ish, sort of, each one picks up where the last one left off; we have a little more time, maybe, than Wheel of Time, but not terribly much, so it will probably be just a couple of years for the first ones, but then we will jump.									</div>

									Do you have any, or will you ever write a gay character into any of your books? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									There are several. Drehy, in <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>, the bridgeman is gay, because he's based off a good friend of mine who's gay. Ranette in the Wax & Wayne books, the woman that Wayne's in love with, she's gay, and it's hinted at in the first book. By the second book, they're like "Dude, she's gay, just leave her alone." So yes, I have written gay characters. I've never written a gay main viewpoint character, maybe someday I will, it's not something I've done yet.									</div>
									
									 
									<h4>Footnote</h4>
									<div>Note from Wetlander: "At this point I asked about Jasnah, and I'll summarize our conversation; Brandon specifically asked me not to transcribe it directly. He'd momentarily forgotten that he had actually written Jasnah viewpoints, so his 'I've never written a gay main viewpoint character' comment wasn't intended to quell the speculation about her either way. He clearly didn't intend to say that she's not gay, but he didn't want to rephrase in such a way as to say that she is, either; at this point, he really doesn't want to give a WoB about her either way. He'll deal with that if/as it becomes relevant to the story—and he refused to give any indication whether that was if or as. We are to continue our speculation if we're interested in the question."

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>I would probably either pick Brent Weeks, who has a very similar style to me, or Brian McClellan, who is one of my students who is now publishing books, and writing very good books. Those guys, either one, I think would do a fine job.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I read McClellan's book on your recommendation. Can you let him know that he needs to put women in his books?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah, that's what I actually told him. My number one criticism when he called me and said, "What do you think of my book?" I said, "You only put one woman in your book, and she's a cliché. She's the friendly cliché, *audio obscured*. The first thing that happens is you get the clichéd damsel in distress, then when people realize "Oh, that's being sexist," they then make the girl awesome, but have no personality. That's like step two. Then step three is real characters, and so I did let him know, and he promised he would do better with future books. I think it is the most legitimate criticism of that book, is that he's just bad with women. But you know, my first book I was terrible; I just didn't publish that one. He's unfortunate that he published it. But even in Mistborn, I only had Vin, so we all fall into this trap, and I've read many women who only put one guy in the book, and he's perfect. It's just something that new authors have a problem with very naturally, so hopefully he'll catch on the same way I caught on.</p>									</div>

																		<div>
									Why do you have so many series going on at once instead of finishing one of them? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									A couple of reasons. The main one is that it's the way I stay fresh as a writer, I find that I get burned out on things. Another main one is that I feel if I'm not practicing different styles, I'll get into a rut, and my writing will repeat itself. It's kind of like a philosophical reason and an instinctual one. I tell people who are annoyed that I'm not writing Stormlight that you wouldn't get Stormlight any faster if I weren't writing these other books in between&mdas;you might get it more slowly, because it's working on other things that really rejuvenates me as a writer. So I would be writing at a Rothfuss speed if I weren't jumping between things.									</div>

									So do you ever put a page length limit on yourself?

																		<div>
									<p>I don't, but I know by gut generally after I start writing how long a book feels.</p>

<p>Does the publisher ever put any limits on you?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>No, they actually haven't. They do ask me if I'll write them shorter, but it's always an ask, and I usually ignore them. In fact, <i>Words of Radiance</i> is the largest book they can physically print with their printer, but the font is not the smallest font they could do yet. So I could actually get about another 100,000 words longer before it gets unreadable.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So by the time we get to Stormlight 6 or 7, they'll have to go buy a new printer?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah, I've warned them. I will write it at the length that feels right.</p>									</div>

									<h4>																				Question (Paraphrased)																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									Note from Wetlander: "This is one where the exact transcription is impossible because everyone is talking over and around one another. Basically a couple of fans were talking with Brandon about making <i>Legion</i> into a TV series; one person thought that in the pilot, the aspects need to be actors, while the other thought that (for the pilot only) they should not be seen, so Stephen looks like a wacky eccentric talking to himself about solving mysteries, and then the episodes would reveal the individuality of the aspects. Brandon agreed that the second approach would be very clever, but that it would be very hard to convince someone [not sure if it was himself, or the aspects, or who!] to do that, because he has them all cast in his head. But then there was this fun bit: 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Normally I don't cast actors in the roles in my books, they're just who they are, but each of the aspects is an actor to me. If you look really closely, you might be able to guess who they are, because they're all famous actors.</p>

<p>We sold it to Lionsgate, and they never made it, and the option lapsed. We've sold it to somebody else now, but we'll see if it ever gets made.</p>									</div>

Every other book I've finished, I know if I wanted to I could go back and write more about those characters. Wheel of Time, I can't. It's done. It's not mine; I can't go write another book about Mat or Perrin or anything like that. So there's a finality to finishing that book that I haven't had with any of my other books.

The thing is, it is kind of a hassle, just because working out release dates and things like that, part of the reason to do&mdash;I think they do gorgeous editions&mdash;but part of the reason to do the e-book things is so that I can be a little bit more spontaneous in releasing them and things like that, and so I'm likely to continue, but it is a bit hard. This time, we were like, "Why don't you guys just release a limited edition, and we'll do a print edition," but then they were like, "No, please don't do one."

									I do. So here's the thing: I am not an emotional person by my nature, and one of the only things that makes me feel very strong emotions is fiction. A really good piece of fiction makes me feel like the characters do, and the rest of the time, I'm just kind of&mdash;I won't say emotionless&mdash;but not emotional. It's not that. It's like some people have wild mood swings; one day they're a 20 and one day they're an 80, on a scale of 1 to 100, right? I'm always a 70, right? Like almost consistently always pleasantly happy. I don't know what depression feels like. I don't know what it really feels like to be sad. I've never really felt that&mdash;except when I'm reading a book. Does that make sense? So that's one of the reasons I write, because I want to be able to go through those emotions with people.									</div>

									So... I designed his culture first, one of the odd cases where I was working on the culture, and out of that grew his character, at odds with his culture.

									Yeah that was actually Taravangian, in the oldest version. One of the very first things I wrote was that, though Taravangian had a different name then, and was very different.

																		<div>
									At the end of <i>A Memory of Light</i>, it mentions that Rand is no longer <i>ta'veren</i>. Does that apply to Mat and Perrin as well? And if it does, how does it apply to Mat's luck? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Everything I'm saying right now is not 100% canon, because I'm only working off of my guesstimates based on his notes. I believe that Mat's luck is a soul attribute that is independent of him being a <i>ta'veren</i>, but enhanced by his <i>ta'veren</i> nature. Part of the proof of this is the Heroes of the Horn knowing him as Gambler, which means in other Ages when he's been born and not been <i>ta'veren</i>, he's still had luck and attraction to things like that. Plus things in the notes, I'm basing on that. So it does not necessarily mean they aren't <i>ta'veren</i> right now, but even if they weren't, I think Mat would still have his luck.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So you don't know whether they're <i>ta'veren</i> or not?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I do not know. My suspicion is that if he would have written the outriggers, Mat still would have been, and maybe Perrin, because Perrin was going to be in the outriggers, we know this. But I don't know for sure.
But I think it would have been fun, if in some parallel dimension if I were to have written them, which I'm never going to, I would have not made Mat <i>ta'veren</i>, or Perrin, I would have made Tuon <i>ta'veren</i>, and forced Mat to deal with someone else who was <i>ta'veren</i>, which I think would have been interesting.</p>

									It was Mary, from the podcast with me, is very good at short fiction. She read it, and she said, "This intro is just holding the story back". And I read it again, and I'm like, "I really feel that she's right". I felt at the end of it that the intro was interesting for people who liked Hoid already, but for people who didn’t, it was just distracting and confusing. So at the end of the day, I cut it out, and I think it was a good move, even though it was sad. If you google the phrase "killing your darlings", it's a phrase we talk about in writing and storytelling. That scene was what made me want to write the book, it's what started me off in writing the book, and then I cut it out. But sometimes you have to end up doing that.									</div>

																		<div>
									When are you going to write the other <i>Warbreaker</i> book? Last time I came to hear you talk, you said you were going to, and now you have 3000 other projects! 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I know, and the <i>Warbreaker</i> fans really get on my case about that. Well, I wrote <i>Words of Radiance</i>, and I got Vasher into it, so that would kindle interest, and make sure that you at least got to see your characters again. But did you hear the story about that? So, I wrote <i>The Way of Kings</i> in 2002, the first version, and in that version Kaladin trained with a swordmaster, and that swordmaster, a guy named Vasher, had a mysterious past. After I finished that book, later on I wrote <i>Warbreaker</i> as a prequel to <i>The Way of Kings</i>, to show Vasher's backstory. But then <i>Warbreaker</i> came out before <i>The Way of Kings</i>, which was a really kind of interesting thing. So in my head, <i>Warbreaker</i> is the prequel, but to everyone else...</p>
<p>Yes, it is a totally different world, different planets, people get around...</p>

<h4>Wetlander</h4>
<p>So how much of Vasher's backstory do we actually have?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Well, a huge chunk of it! If you were reading <i>The Way of Kings</i>, you would know nothing, and then you'd read <i>Warbreaker</i> and you'd be like, "Oh, here's a whole past that he had!" That doesn't mean it's all of his past.</p>									</div>
									
									 
									<h4>Footnote</h4>
									<div>Note from Wetlander: "He's not giving any hints as to whether Vasher had any connection with Roshar prior to <i>Warbreaker</i>. Or at least not without someone asking a much more direct question."

																		<h4>

									<p>What happened there was, I came in when the first game was already made. They said we'd really like to do something, and I really like the guys, they're friends of mine, and I'm like, "You don't have a story here. You've got to have a protagonist and things like this." So then I said, "Okay, let's take what you have, tell me what you have for the world, and let's brainstorm together, and let's construct a narrative". And so we did it together. We spent a lot of time in their offices constructing the next two games, then I was able to write the novellas between the two.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So did you have any input on the game stories, then?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yes, I did. I had a lot of influence, though I did not write the dialogue, so sometimes it's a little bit cringe-worthy. They sent me the script, but I just didn't have time to go over the scripts for them. Sometime I'd like to actually do a game with them, because they make great games.</p>									</div>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									When you started writing cosmere novels, how much of it had you outlined? How far ahead had you thought? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>When I started writing cosmere novels? When I <i>started</i> started, I was a teenager. Totally hadn't thought very far ahead. When I was an adult and I was writing them, I wrote one when I was like 20, and I had an inkling, and I played around with things. The first one that I wrote with a real, conscious eye toward the cosmere was <i>Elantris</i>. So the ones that have been published, yes. But when I first started, I had a little bit of an inkling.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Have you ever backed yourself into a corner with it?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Not yet! I have backed myself into corners by saying things to fans that I've already changed in my notes and hadn't realized I had, and stuff like that. I do that all the time. But usually when I do that, I just tell them. "Ah, I'm sorry, I just changed this, guys." I'm still convinced that Stayer and Stepper&mdash;that [Robert Jordan] didn't know those were two different horses. I'm utterly convinced that he made the mistake, and then just covered it. Because that's the sort of things we writers do.</p>

<p>One of the ones I've been working on a lot lately is, how much can you affect things that are Invested with other magic systems? Should it be not at all, should it be a little bit, should it be... But then I have to go back to Mistborn, and I've got canon here, where people are pushing and pulling on things that are Invested, but I tried when I was even writing Mistborn to make sure that the someone was drawing on the Mist, or had extra power for some reason before they were pushing on... and so I left myself that room, but at the same time I've established that you can do it, so anyway.</p>									</div>

									I actually plot <i>The Stormlight Archive</i> books as a trilogy; each book&mdash;like I would plot the entire Reckoners series&mdash;I plot that for a book, and then I plot the short story sequence, and then I plot the novella. Usually the flashback sequence is a novella. And so then I write basically three books, a short story collection, and a novella, and put them all together woven as one book.									</div>

																		<div>
									<p>That is true.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So is it a planet that we've seen before, or...</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yes. Well, you have seen the people they are calling "The Ones Above."</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>And you're not going to tell any more?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Nope.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>When will we know?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah, fifteen years maybe? Hopefully it won't take me that long, but I only just finished the outlines for Era 3 Mistborn, which is now what we're calling the 1980's, so I haven't even at the moment got the sketches of the sci-fi one, I don't have the outlines and things. So in other words, we aren't to the science fiction era; we're a ways off from that.</p>									</div>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									What do you think is the difference between SciFi and Fantasy? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>SciFi works with the improbable becoming reality; Fantasy works with the impossible pretending to be reality. I think the line is between what could be and what can't be. By my definition, that kind of takes Star Wars into Fantasy. I don't necessarily like Asimov's definitions, just because he was very down on fantasy. A lot of the fantasy of his era was very Conan-ish. He was a great writer, I respect his fiction a lot, but I don't think he gave fantasy its fair due.</p>

<p>I would count Star Trek definitely science fiction, they're trying to talk about&mdash;even though they're using fantastical teleporters and stuff&mdash;they're trying to say this is what's possible. It's social science fiction, a lot of it.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>But wouldn't you say Star Wars is really both?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I would say it's a mash-up hybrid. It's a fantasy magic system in a space opera science-fiction setting.</p>									</div>

									What was the main inspiration for <i>Elantris</i>?

																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									My main inspiration for <i>Elantris</i> was reading in the New Testament, actually, about lepers and leper colonies, and wanting to write a story about a magical leper colony. And that's where the idea for the people who got this disease, and the city, and everything like that.									</div>

																		<div>
									Note from Wetlander: "In the acknowledgements to <i>Firefight</i>, he thanks his beta-, gamma- and proof-readers and promises that if he ever becomes an Epic, he will kill them last. This triggered a discussion among said readers regarding their defense, and the primary question… what’s his weakness? Chocolate? No, not chocolate."

									<p>Mac'n'cheese? Well, No 'cause I like mac'n'cheese too much. Fish sticks. It would be fish sticks.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I thought you disliked fish sticks.</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Exactly. That's why they’d be my weakness.</p>									</div>

									When is the second book of <i>The Rithmatist</i> coming out?

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									I haven't written it yet. I started doing the research, and it was so much work I realized I needed more time to do it, because I'm going to South America in it, and I just needed to know South American cultures better, so I decided I need to take another year to do research. So I'm doing research for it right now, I'm going to write it hopefully after I finish the next Stormlight book, and then we'll release it soon after. So it's a little ways away.									</div>
