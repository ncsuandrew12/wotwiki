									<p>Hey, all. Brandon Sanderson here. It's been a while since I did <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=622">my first /r/fantasy AMA</a>, and so I'm back for more punishment...er...questions.</p>

<p>I will answer pretty much anything, though you might want to check out the first AMA to see if your question has already been asked. Feel free to ask spoiler questions, particularly about <i>A Memory of Light</i>, but do use Spoiler tags (see the bottom right) to keep from ruining the book for others.</p>

<p>That should be everything! I'll be answering questions all day, really, rather than being back at a specific time. Oh, I almost forgot. <a href="http://postimg.org/image/r0jtnydsx/">I need to post some proof.</a> There, that should make it very clear this is really me.</p>

									<p>Hey there Brandon, thanks for doing another AMA!</p>

<p>Unpublished authors are often told that agents and publishers won't even look at a debut novel longer than 150k words. Your debut, <i>Elantris</i>, was considerably longer than that. How did you get your foot in the door? Was it just a query letter, or did you pitch the novel to someone at a convention/conference? If the former, would you mind sharing that query synopsis with us?</p> 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I pitched it at a convention. (World Fantasy Convention, which was in Montreal that year.) WFC does still tend to be one of the best places to meet editors/agents if you're interested in publishing with a mainstream publisher.</p>

<p><i>Elantris</i> was 250k words, and I had a real rough time getting my foot in the door with it. The editor I met there let me pitch to him after we had a nice long conversation about the authors he was working on at the moment. Dan Wells, who was with me, also pitched and sent his book. His got read far more quickly than mine did. (His was far shorter.)</p>

<p>I waited eighteen months for a reply—so long, that I'd given up on the book. The editor said that every time he sat down to read slush, that enormous book intimidated him, so he picked something shorter to read. When he finally read Elantris, he only got two chapters in before he wanted to buy it—which is nice.</p>

<p>Editors have a love/hate relationship with huge books like this. The big ones do tend to drive the epic fantasy market, but they're more expensive to produce than the short ones, and therefore more risky to take a chance on. I would never suggest writing your books shorter than you feel is the right length, but do realize that both readers and editors will cock an eyebrow at you if the length goes too long. They expect more payoff for the increased size.</p>

<p>Digital formats, fortunately, are helping change this perception. Size (either direction) is no longer as limiting as it once was.</p>

<h4>LyndseyLuther</h4>

<p>Thanks for the reply! I was actually at WFC this past year and you gave me great advice about going to the room parties. It was definitely an experience.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px">I waited eighteen months for a reply—so long, that I'd given up on the book.</p>

<p>You have no idea how much a relief it is to hear you say that. Thank you. Currently playing the waiting game on a book I submitted, and I was getting worried. But knowing that it took so long for someone to get back to you and that the answer was in the positive put my mind at rest a little.</p>

Thanks again, look forward to seeing you in Connecticut in July!</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>It's perfectly acceptable to send a polite email to an editor if they've had your book for a long time. Just say that you're curious if it's still being considered, or if there's a chance it has been lost. (Usually, six months is the time to send this.)</p>

<h4>cosmando</h4>

<p>What does pitching a book look like? I'm familiar with how that would work in the movie business, but I'd never considered it in the publishing realm.</p>

<p>P.S. love all of your books.</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Usually, this is the two or three sentence explanation of a book you'd put in a query letter. It focuses on one idea in the book, kind of the 'concept." Not that different from a Hollywood pitch, only a little less...uh...Hollywood.</p>

<p>For <i>Elantris</i> it was something like "The Prince of a kingdom catches a terrible magical disease, and is locked away in a prison city with everyone else who has the disease. He works to bring unity, hope, and perhaps a cure to the city."</p>									</div>

									You said that every person on Scadrial has a bit of Preservation in them. It is possible, then, to accumulate enough Hemalurgic charge from killing normal people by, say, steel spike (at once, or in order), to make that spike grant Allomancy? Building on this, is it possible for the spike to accumulate charge while being imbedded in acceptor body, by killing people with the protruding end?

									You're obviously known for your creative and unique magic systems, and magic-centric stories. How often do you have the urge to write works that don't involve any magic at all? Have you done this in the past and they've gone unpublished? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>

									<p>It depends on if you count the vague 'science' of a soft science fiction as magic. If you look at something like "<a href="http://www.tor.com/stories/2008/12/firstborn">Firstborn</a>" or <i>Legion</i>, there are only faint magical elements. However, since I'm not a hard SF writer, they are there.</p>

<p>I'd say that once in a while, I feel myself wanting to write something along those lines—but I've never had an idea that wasn't at least marginally sf/f that screamed at me to write it. What can I say? It is the wonder and the imagination of sf/f that made me into a reader in the first place. Whatever idea I come up with, I find that adding some speculative fiction elements makes me more excited about it.</p>									</div>

									Maybe I'm a bit ignorant here, but what is the motivation for a fascinating character like Wit/Hoid? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I have always been impressed by masterworks like those done by King/Asimov, weaving multiple works by one author together into a single continuity. I felt that most authors who have done it didn't have the chance to start from the beginning intending to combine worlds. It is something that they decided upon after the fact. So, I thought I'd give it a try from book one.</p>

<p>I love stand alone novels, but I also love big epics. This was a way to let me have both at the same time with some of my works. And so, Hoid was born as a character plotting behind the scenes of my novels, connecting them together into a larger tapestry.</p>

<h4>Kurkistan</h4>

<p>Have you ever felt constrained by this commitment to consistency across the Cosmere, or does it amount to "limitations are more interesting than powers" as applies to own options as an author?</p>

									You've mentioned several philosophical concepts used in the writing of your books, like Jung's collective unconsciousness, Plato's cave. Could you expand a bit on your use of those in your books, and whether you think it is necessary to use philosophy to make a good fantasy world? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I don't think it's necessary at all. The writer's own fascinations—whatever they are—can add to the writing experience. But yes, some philosophical ideas worked into my fiction. Plato's theory of the forms has always fascinated, and so the idea of a physical/cognitive/spiritual realm is certainly a product of this. Human perception of ideals has a lot to do with the cognitive realm, and a true ideal has a lot to do with the spiritual realm.</p>

<p>As for more examples, they're spread through my fiction. Spinoza is in there a lot, and Jung has a lot to do with the idea of spiritual connectivity (and how the Parshendi can all sing the same songs.)</p>

<h4>Nepene</h4>

<p>Not completely sure where Spinoza comes in. I guess the shards are part of the natural world and have no personality without a human wielder.</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Yes on Spinoza there, and also the idea of God being in everything, and everything of one substance. Unifying laws. Those sorts of things. (Less his determinism, though.)</p>									</div>

									<p>There are connections in the things you mentioned above, though I don't want to speak of specifics yet for risk of spoiling future revelations.</p>

<p>As for blurring the line between what makes sense and what is fun...I err on the side of the fun. However, part of my meticulous planning is about how to make the fun make sense. I feel that is part of what makes this genre interesting. I decided I wanted to do a story about the Knights Radiant, with the Plate and Blades. From there, I spent a long time thinking about what would make those kinds of weapons reasonable and important to a society.</p>

<p>Melanie Rawn's sunrunner books are some of my classic favorites, and not as well known by many modern readers.</p>

									<p>Hi, Brian. Good luck with the book launch!</p>

<p>I write about 2,500 words a day, writing at around 500 words an hour. My production is more about being consistent than about being fast. I do tend to write around ten hours a day. Don't know if I have any tips other than to perhaps turn off the internet or go outside and write for a while.</p>

<p>EDIT: Posted a little bit of clarity on the 2,500 words a day, and what I do with the rest of the time, below.</p>

<h4>FishingForCod</h4>

<p>If you write about 500 words an hour and write for 10 hours a day? Isn't that 5000 words a day?</p>

<p>I see that doing good at math isn't very important as an author. ^ ^</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Ha. I should have been clear. You're absolutely right to point this out.</p>

<p>I spend a large amount of time each day answering email, working on the wiki for my worlds, planning new books, and revising. Many days, I actually do around 3500 words, but the average tends to be closer to 2500 or even 2000 once editing and everything is factored in.</p>									</div>

									How much of writing is based on 'nature' and an individual's innate abilities versus the 'nurture' part of honing your craft? There are those writers who seem to strike a brilliant tone with their first works while others spend a lifetime studying without much success.

									<p>I wish I could answer this first one in a specific way. I think both are certainly a factor. In my class, people come through with immediate talent&mdash;but, then, those also tend to be the ones who have practiced writing the most.</p>

<p>I would say that the nurture part is the most important part for the vast majority of us. However, there are savants who just HIT it their first try.</p>									</div>

									What things influence you when creating and developing characters? Are you pulling from real-life experiences with other people? Are you pulling from parts of yourself? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									A lot of both, honestly. The third factor, however, is a good conflict. When I see or imagine a conflict for a character to have to deal with, I end up wanting to put it into a story. Sometimes, it's a conflict that another character in media has that I have either enjoyed or (more often) feel that the book/film didn't do it justice. So, I pull that part out, rework it until I'm satisfied that I'm being original with it rather than making a copy, and put it to work.									</div>

									Does music play any role in getting your creative juices flowing? If so, any specifics you'd like to credit? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Yes. I will use music to inspire me if I'm having a hard time or need a specific punch. Other times, I generally just have Pandora going on a station with lots of classical and electronica. I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk, however, and will use Alive (the live album) to get me in the right mood for some scenes. Soundtracks are great too. Anything by Michael Kamen can usually get me into the right mood for writing. Harry Gregson-Williams is another go-to composer for me.</p>

<p>Oh, and I almost forgot. I love OC Remixes as well. I tend to listen to a lot of them while planning stories while I run on an exercise Machine. <a href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00690/">One of my favorites is here.</a></p>									</div>

									<p>Boy...favorite scene? That's going to be tough, as anything about my books plays into the "which of your children do you like the most" mentality that authors have. It's hard to choose.</p>

									I'm also wondering about the several duel with Demandred. Isn't Gawyn a bit too weak in this book? From the previous books, Gawyn was said to be able to easily take down other Warders and even win in a practice against two Warders together. Then with a single Bloodknife ring, the wearer is supposed to have superhuman strength/speed that can't really be matched, and he was using not one but three rings. While Galad has been established throughout the series to be better than Gawyn, I find it strange that Galad was able to hurt Demandred with nothing but a imperfect foxhead medallion copy, while Gawyn with three Bloodknives rings and Warder bond didn't remotely stand a chance against Demandred? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									Gawyn is good, but not really, really good. In addition, he has an inflated sense of HOW good he is. He doesn't have the inner control and understanding to be a fully capable swordsman. Beyond that, he mistakes power for ability, and lets himself grow too reckless. Finally, having enhanced abilities, such as the rings grant him, doesn't immediately give you the skill to make full use of those abilities. Gawyn tried, and deserves credit for that, but in the end he had not spent years preparing himself properly to win that particular contest.									</div>

									Hey Brandon! I've always wondered this, what is the best way to support you as an author? Do you make more money if we buy an ebook, off of amazon, or at Barnes & Nobles? As a fan of yours I want to make sure you're receiving as much of the money as I can give. 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I get this question on occasion, and always feel the best thing for me to do is emphasize that I prefer you to buy the format that makes you the most happy. That way, you are encouraged to keep reading, and that is really what is best for me.</p>

<p>Most authors makes something around the following:</p>

<p>Hardcover, 15% of cover. (Regardless of store, unless it's a bargain book.)</p>

<p>Paperback, 8% of cover. (Regardless of venue.)</p>

<p>Ebook, 17.5% of the list price. (Unless they are self-published, and then it's usually 65-70% of list price.)</p>

<p>So, the best way to get money to an author is to buy the hardcover, preferably during launch week. (That influences how high the book gets on bestseller lists and how much in-store support it gets.)</p>

<p>However, I don't think that is something a reader needs to worry too much about. To be honest, rather than thinking about this, I think most authors would say that the best thing you can do for us is just read the books. Second best is to loan your copies to a friend so they can enjoy the books too.</p>

<h4>firsthour</h4>

<p>With these percentages, were you then sharing/splitting it with the Robert Jordan estate for the Wheel of Time books?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h4>deadlycrate</h4>

<p>Can I just send you money?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>I suppose you could—but I'd rather you buy a copy of one of my books and give it to someone. If I have you send me money, then we work around all of the people who deserve their share for helping me out. (Like my agent and editor.)</p>

<h4>stave</h4>

<p>Risky question time! How do you feel about those of us that buy your hardcover, then go and pirate the ebook?<br>
* This comment is not an admission of guilt.</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Risky answer time. I've got no problem with it. I wish I could actively give away the ebook to everyone who bought the hardcover. I can actually do this on books like <i>Legion</i> and <i>The Emperor's Soul</i>, where I retain rights to the ebook. (So I do.)</p>

<p>I'm not encouraging this, mind you. But I'm also not going to complain or make anyone feel guilty. If you've paid for the content once, I feel you should have access to it into the future, whenever you want, in any format you want. (With the exception being audiobook, where the voice actors deserve to be paid for their work above and beyond me getting paid for the writing.)</p>

<h4>oditogre</h4>

<p>What about with audiobooks? I subscribe to Audible and I can't help notice the price I pay for my subscription makes the books I get a steal compared to buying them without subscription or buying actual discs. How does that work out for the authors?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Audible has done wonderful things for the audiobook market, helping the format gain a lot of popularity. But their prices ARE rock bottom. I don't know off-hand how much we make. I don't mind, however, because audiobooks in the past were so horribly expensive.</p>									</div>

									<p>My favorite part of the Mistborn trilogy was Sazed and his scholarly work. I really liked how you described the motivations behind and the methods used in his analyses of religious doctrines. It seemed like you took a lot of care in writing about his quest.</p>

<p>Was Sazed's search inspired by any sort of scholarly work you've done, on religion or otherwise? </p> 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Yes, it was, though his sequence in the third was one of the most difficult to get right in any book I've written.  Originally, I wrote it as him having already come to the conclusion he does near the end&mdash;that all religion is false&mdash;and that left him wallowing about in a depressive funk through most of the book. This was just horribly boring to read, and it was only through revision that I decided to show his quest.</p>

<p>I am a religious person, and have spent a lot of time thinking, questioning, and deciding what I believe and why. I don't think questions like these are easy ones to answer, and anything that is difficult is prime material for storytelling in my mind. Writing Sazed was an exploration for me as much as it was an exploration for the character.</p>									</div>

									<p>For an architect, should a book be written as a complete work, which you then break into chapters? Or should I be focusing on writing chapter by chapter from the start?</p>

<p>Also, what order should revision be done in, what do you work on first? Punctuation and grammar, trimming, pacing, characters? What do you find usually gives the biggest pay-off first?</p> 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>1) Both methods have worked for me in the past, so I don't know if there is a "Should" here. I think that early on, visualizing the book as a sequence of chapters which achieve certain goals is a useful way to finish your first few novels. It helps with the step-by-step method of getting it done. I use something more organic now, however.</p>

<p>2) My method is this:</p>

<p>Revision One: Fix continuity, big problems.</p>

<p>Revision Two: Make the language more active, get rid of repetition.</p>

<p>Revision Three: Fix problems mentioned by alpha readers (so long as I agree with them.)</p>

<p>Revision Four: Cut 15%</p>

<p>Revisions 5-7: Beta reader issues, more editorial fixes, more of all above.</p>

<p>However, in those early chapters, the biggest payoff is going to come from making certain character voice is solid and that the language isn't dull. (Trim info-dumps, get rid of passive constructions, that sort of thing.)</p>									</div>

																		<h4>

									<p>Well, it would be tough—I'd have to decide if I wanted the party to be crazy, interesting, or low risk.</p>

<p>For example, inviting Hoid and Kelsier to the same party could result in murdering. Having Sazed around with someone like Jasnah would lead to some great discussions of philosophy.</p>

<p>In the end, I'd probably pick the core WoT cast, just because they've been my friends for so long. Longer than anyone other than Wit and Dalinar, actually. So Perrin, Rand, Mat, Egwene, Nynaeve, and Thom. Fourth book era.</p>

									I was wondering something about the Stormlight Archive. You have said before that an upcoming book will be <i>The Highprince of War</i>. Will this definitely be Dalinar's book, or could this be referring to a subsequent Highprince of War (like Dalinar's sons?). And a quick side question: how is book 2 coming along? Can we still hope for a late 2013 release? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>Book two has been renamed <i>Words of Radiance</i>, as it's Shallan's book. Dalinar's book will be Book Five. (Though I haven't promised he will survive that long. I reserve the right to do flashbacks for someone in a book after they have died.)</p>

<p>It WILL be Dalinar's book, however, not one of his sons.</p>

<p>Late 2013 is still possible. I'm about 2/3 of the way done.</p>									</div>

									I was just wondering what your process for developing magic systems is? How do you turn a cool idea into something that makes sense and is cohesive without taking away from the mystery and magic of it all? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>This is a difficult question to answer in the space given. I'm going to assume you've read Sanderson's First Law and Sanderson's Second Law, the rules I place upon myself in writing magic systems. I assume you've also watched the lectures on the topic.</p>

<p>I'll just answer the second part of your question, then, and leave the above to answer the more general "What is your process?"</p>

<p>Every bit you add to magic's cohesiveness does take away from its sense of wonder somewhat. It's a trade off. However, it doesn't have to steal everything. Letting characters be able to use the magic, but leaving them without understanding the WHY it all works is part of this. (Better if you know why and can start dropping hints.)</p>

<p>There will always be mystery in the world to a character with an inquisitive nature. If they are asking questions, wondering, striving to learn and explore, you will have wonder in your books.</p>									</div>

									</div>
																		
																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>I do wish I'd managed to either get it all into one book, or managed the split between <i>The Gathering Storm</i>/<i>Towers of Midnight</i> better. Also, I might have tried to work Fain in more if I'd had more time. Also, there are some little continuity errors here and there that I wish I would have caught.</p>

<p>It's hard to say. For example, would I have written Mat differently in <i>The Gathering Storm</i> if I'd had the time? Perhaps. But it was writing Mat the way I did that helped me understand him, so perhaps not. There are mistakes in the books I did, as there are in all the books I've done, but I'm not sure if the right thing to do is change them. Otherwise, we get into a Lucas-style revision-fest.</p>									</div>

									I thought we had this wiggle room through observation of the text and what RJ had written, but it's entirely possible that I'm wrong. I'd have to go look and dig out the appropriate quotes. That entire scene, I'll admit, came from my insistence that the Heroes not be able to simply fight the Last Battle on behalf of mankind. Since RJ wasn't explicit either way, I wanted it specifically mentioned that the Heroes are there to help, not to do all the work on their own. It's a narrative point of importance to me. Perhaps I went too far. I'll ask Maria about this at JordanCon this week and see if we made an error.									</div>

<p>After WoT, I'd pick <i>Legion</i>, which I envisioned as a show even as I wrote it.</p>

<h4>Zdus</h4>

<p>I see having the WOT becoming a series would be awesome if it is taken care of, for example the The song of Fire and Ice series on HBO. It would be unfair to Robert Jordan if it turns out like The Sword of Truth series did in the form of <i>Legend of the Seeker</i>.</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>Yeah, that's the danger with the TV series route. I certainly wouldn't want to see that happen.</p>									</div>

									<p>I recently picked up the Mistborn Adventure game and am loving it. I made a character who is a blind Mistborn because hey, I thought it would make for some interesting possibilities. As I understand Allomancy, he can hear/sense well enough to get around with Tin, plus even though he's blind he can still "see" Steel lines (like the inquisitors), and I assume Atium would work the same way—that is, he could still "see" Atium shadows. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p> 
									</div>

																		<div>
									<p>No, you're right. That works. He'd have to burn metals a LOT though. It might warp him a little. :)</p>

<h4>Herowannabe</h4>

<p>The metal that's stumping me is Gold—what happens when a blind person burns Gold—especially if he "sees" a version of himself that isn't blind? Can he see the other version or just hear/feel/sense him? What about the other version, can it see things? Could a blind person use gold in this way to see the world around him?</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>

<p>A blind person would indeed sense these things, but not have the vision with the eyes. In the same way that a blind person still dreams, but doesn't "See" in them. (As I understand it.) I'd suggest talking to someone who is blind and getting their take on how this would work.</p>									</div>

									Can an infused Hemalurgy spike be affected by Allomancy—steel pushes and iron pulls? Or does the charge interfere with the Allomancy much like a persons body would? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Anything infused (regardless of the world or magic that infused it) is resistant to magic. So you'd have a lot of trouble pushing or pulling on a spike, unless you had access to a boost of some sort to overcome the resistance.</p>

<h4>theofficetroll</h4>

<p>So, Nightblade would be resistant to steelpushing? Good to know ;-)</p>

<h4>Herowannabe</h4>

<p>My friend and I asked him something like this at a book signing, but for some reason it never seemed to make it onto 17th Shard. We asked if a shardblade or Nightblood could be used as a hemalurgic spike (i.e.: two different investitures of magic). Brandon said that yes, in theory you could do that, but objects have a limit to how much investiture they can hold, and that it could be argued that things like Nightblood and Shardblades are already "full."</p>									</div>

									<p>Would you ever expand on <i>The Alloy of Law</i>? I loved the ending, it made me want even more.</p>

<p>Speaking of <i>Alloy of Law</i>... To me it felt paced like a good movie. I feel like it would make a super fun movie. Just wanted to say that.</p>

<p>Keep being awesome!</p>


<h4>Phantine</h4>
<p>Ooh! I can answer this one. The sequel to <i>Alloy of Law</i> is called <i>Shadows of Self</i>. As far as I know, there hasn't been a date specified on when it'll come out since it's unwritten, but the best fan guess is sometime in 2014.</p>

<p>I agree on the movie thing. It's like Lethal Weapon with allomancers.</p>

Now, sometimes when you combine large groups and anonymity, you get some pretty caustic interactions. I avoid those. I don't feel reddit is any worse or better in this regard than other websites.

									<p>I tend to write about things that interest me. My religion is important to me, and so religion in general fascinates me. I find myself including it not as a requirement, but as an aspect of what I find interesting.</p>

<p>As nothing bothers me more than reading a book in which the person who believes like me is treated like an idiot, I try to be aware of peoples beliefs (or lack thereof) and explore the issue in multiple dimensions.</p>

<p>My intention in writing stories it to write great stories. Who I am, and what I find moral, is going to seep into it&mdash;I don't know that I'd want to stop that. However, I'm not trying to influence people specifically. I do try to present interesting ideas, but I let those be driven by the characters.</p>

<p>This is actually a harder question to answer than, at times, I've realized. I feel that people are given talents to enrich the lives of those around them, and I feel our job as people on this earth is to do our best to make life better for everyone involved. Can fantasy stories do that? I hope so. But I don't sit down to say "What am I going to teach people today?" I sit down and write, "What can I do that is awesome."</p>

<p>I guess I hope that increasing the awesomeness in the world will make people's lives better.</p>

									<p>I'll preface this with a warning. Even though the series is done, and I can speak more freely, some things are intended to be vague by RJ's own intention. This allows dreaming and thinking about the world to continue. For example, I can't answer question 2 for these reasons. For question one, I think RJ himself was vague. (Maybe a Theorylander can speak here.) This isn't one I'm capable of answering, because I don't want to make an answer canon one way or another, as I don't think RJ wanted that.</p>

									<p>Several times in <i>Way of Kings</i>, you have characters think of the Shin as having big or round eyes. Do the Shin really have giant eyes, or do all the other peoples of Roshar have an epicanthic fold on their eyes?</p>

<p>It seemed to me that this was very similar to how characters in second world fantasies, like Faile in Wheel of Time, are designated as "Asian" even though there is no Asia in the book. Is this a subversion of that? Are the Shin the only people on Roshar who look Western European?</p> 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>You are right, actually. Normal eyes on Roshar are those with an epicanthic fold. The Shin do not have this. Note, however, that they wouldn't look "Western European." Roshar races are fairly far off from what we imagine as Earth ones. The people most likely to look Western European to you would be those from Mistborn.</p> 									</div>

									<p>I don't really have a question, I just want to say that the twist at the end of <i>Well of Ascension</i> absolutely blew my mind.</p>

<p>I specifically remember when Sazed noticed the Holy First Witness in the prophecy, I was surprised I hadn't made that connection myself since I remember the prophecy so well. Then I get to the end where we learn about Ruin altering text, and thought that was an amazing plot twist, and I started wondering if you'd been altering the text in the passages at the beginning of chapters, since some of them were repeated a few times. THEN I suddenly remembered that the text originally referred to the Announcer, not the Holy First Witness, and . . . my mind was blown. That was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced in any fiction I've read.</p>

									<p>Now that you're done with the Wheel of Time series, could you update us on your writing plans going forward? I know about the three books coming out this year, but it would be great to see what your thoughts are on the multi-year plan, including the scifi Mistborn trilogy. Are there any plans for sequels to <i>Rithmatist</i> or <i>Steelheart</i>?</p>

									<p>Current plans are as follows:</p>

<p>2013: <i>Rithmatist</i>, <i>Steelheart</i>, <i>Words of Radiance</i><br> 
2014: <i>Shadows of Self</i>, Steelheart 2<br>
2015: Stormlight 3, Rithmatist 2</p>

<p>Usually, in the past, I've done one smaller book and one larger book a year. This is what I'd like to get back to doing. (As opposed to last year and this year—where last year had no novels, and this year has four, including <i>A Memory of Light</i>.)</p>									</div>

									<p>I have a technical question here re: gemstones in The Stormlight Archive. How are the lines drawn between different types of gems? Emerald and Heliodor are both varieties of the mineral beryl. Emerald can get its color from trace amounts of chromium, vanadium and/or iron. Heliodor gets its color from iron combined with microscopic crystal defects. So, is the line between these two defined by color? If so, would a heliodor lose its usefulness if it were heated (which would turn it colorless or pale blue). Is it defined by trace elements—in which case, how do you deal with emeralds, or with aquamarine (the blue variety of beryl, which can also contain chromium or vanadium in small quantities and is mostly colored by iron)? Sorry for getting so technical, but this gem nerd needs to know!</p>

									<p>I actually spent a long time working on this while building the world. You'd probably be amused by how long I spent on it. Chemically, many of them are actually very similar, as you pointed out. I tried doing the book originally with them all being different, not using any that were basically the same crystal with different colors, but it didn't work out. There weren't enough, and so I had to stretch to make it all work.</p>

<p>So, I went back to the original, and decided that color was enough to differentiate them. Just as steel and iron are very similar in the Mistborn world, emerald and heliodor can be very similar—but produce different effects. The idea here is that the physical items (like the metals or the crystals) provide a key by which magical interaction occurs.</p>

<p>So, in a long winded answer, a gemstone with an impure color would be considered like a bad alloy in the Mistborn magic—it either wouldn't work at all, or would work very poorly. The chemical and color signature needs to be of a specific variety to provide the proper key to accessing the power of transformation.</p>

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>Well, this question is loaded with some issues. First off, there's the concept of the Pattern. Does it have a will? The Wheel does the weaving. The Pattern more IS...but some quotes in the books do ascribe small motives to it. This doesn't even get into the idea of whether what the characters believe is true or if it is simply their way of understanding.</p>

<p>Let's put it at this...Moiraine would say that the Wheel has woven what it Willed, and men beating against it only served to more surely enmesh them into their places.</p> 									</div>

									<p>I wondered particularly about, in the epilogue, Alivia leaving the supplies for the body-swapped Rand.

									<p>That scene was indeed one of the ones that Robert Jordan wrote before he passed away, and was include as is. He MIGHT have included her a tad more in other scenes, but the notes were blank on her save for this last scene, so I don't know. I know for certain that her helping Rand to die meant only leaving the items for him. It was a very small thing that fandom (perhaps by RJ's design) blew up into something much larger. The characters did too, to an extent.</p>

									<p>I've got a non-Brandon-specific question. I just happened to think about one thing about authors:  When do you decide if the character is male or female?</p>

<p>1. Did it happen to one of your characters that you changed the gender pretty late?</p>

<p>2. What is important when choosing the gender?</p>

<p>3. So why did you make Vin female and not male, for example? Is it much easier to write a male character as a male?</p>

<p>Personally, I don't like books where a woman is very physically strong. I don't know, I'm strange. gotta admit I stopped reading Mistborn after the first book due to it. As I said, I'm strange...Still love your books and I never was looking forward to a book as much as I am looking for followup of <i>Way of Kings</i>. (Not even Harry Potter LOL!)</p> 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>1. Vin, in Mistborn, started as a boy. I wrote about one chapter of <i>Mistborn</i> with her as a guy, then changed. However, another character by that name had existed in one of my unpublished books as a boy.</p>

<p>2. This is hard to answer, as characters are very organic things for me. I don't plan them nearly as much as I do plots or settings. I go with my gut when writing them. I can't say why some "feel" right as male and other "feel" right as female. I write it and see if it works. If their voice is right, I go with it.</p>

<p>3. As mentioned, Vin swapped genders. It had to do with my writing instincts, her dynamic with the other characters, her backstory, and just WHO she is. I'm sorry that I'm not being very specific. Characters are hard to explain.</p>

									<p>Thank you for doing this AMA, Mr. Sanderson! You're a huge inspiration to me and, though you may not remember me, I met you in Portland on your AMOL tour a few months ago. I had mentioned that I had been working on my book and you told me to listen to your podcast and that there was no excuse not to write! I've taken that to heart and have been writing my fingers off ever since.</p>

<p>But what I've found is that I've been written pages and pages of history about the world that I'm creating as a sort of encyclopedia for myself. My question is thus:</p>

<p>When preparing to write a book, how do go about world building? Do you have everything in mind from the start and just work from there, or do you write everything out to use as a reference later?</p>

<p>I feel like I'm doing too much work on building the history, and not enough time writing the actual story. Therefore my question. Thank you for any response you give!</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I am the type that likes to do a lot of worldbuilding ahead of time, before writing. However, I feel it is easy to go too far in this regard. I usually give myself a set amount of time to spend planning a story, then I need to start writing. (At least a few chapters.) By writing some of the book, I can get a better idea of how much worldbuilding I'll need, and which areas need the most work.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that great worldbuilding is usually that which intersects with character interests and conflicts. Having your history in line can help the world feel rich&mdash;but it can also distract if you spend too much time in the book giving dumps of information about historical events that don't have any bearing on the current characters or conflicts.</p>

<p>You don't need to have everything in place before you start. You can always add more as you go. Focus your attention on those aspects of worldbuilding that will help the story be better. Worldbuild religions if those are important to the story; otherwise, spend a shorter amount of time planning them. Same for languages, history, governments, and all the other things you can do.</p>

<p>At some point, you need to start writing. Err on the side of not enough worldbuilding. You can fill more in later.</p>

									<p>Hello Mr. Sanderson, I have a question about bendalloy bubbles—what happens to a human that is partially in and partially out of the bubble when it's placed? Does the difference in the flow of time kill him?</p>

<p>And, if yes, is the boundary of active bendalloy bubble effectively impassable for living organisms? I get that bullets shot out of the bubble randomly change directions, but what happens to, let's say, a person trying to jump out of the bubble (or, given enough time, a person trying to get inside)?</p>

									<p>When you were working on <i>A Memory of Light</i>, I know Mr. Jordan had the fates of most, if not all of the characters written down. Were there any characters where you got to decide the fate of, either in <i>A Memory of Light</i> or the previous two books?</p>

									<p>Yes, there were some. For example, Pevara's fate isn't mentioned in the notes, which is why I felt all right co-opting her for the Black Tower storyline, which was mostly mine. Siuan's fate wasn't mentioned in the notes, save for the rescue of Egwene from the White Tower. Harriet made the decision on how her story was to play out.</p>

									<p>Yes and no. For example, I think that some of the explanations in <i>Elantris</i> for how the magic works at the end are not terribly clear. However, at the same time, it is the process of making mistakes like this that helps us learn and evolve as writers. Beyond that, going back and changing a piece of art to be something else kind of defeats the point of creating different works of art as one changes as a person. So I don't know if I'd change the mistakes.</p>									</div>

									<p>For me, editing/redrafting is a vastly more intimidating process than writing the initial draft.

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>I keep telling myself that if I don't fix it in this draft, I can do another one, and that's okay. So narrowing down my drafting goals to something manageable each time helps a lot. Also, giving myself specific goals. If a character needs to be revised, I look for every scene with that character and make the revisions. I don't always read the whole book, I go and fix that character. Then, when I next read the book, I can watch for continuity with the fixes.</p>

									<p>In the Mistborn Trilogy was one of the coolest twists I've ever come across, and foreshadowing is kind of a tightrope walk. If you don't point out Chekhov's gun often enough, it won't have impact when it's fired, but if you belabor it, it'll be too obvious that it's important (almost like watching an old cartoon where you could see which objects were going to be animated before the fact because they stood out so much against the static background), and the payoff won't be as satisfying. How do you determine exactly how much to emphasize foreshadowing?</p>

<p>I understand this is imposing terribly, but it does say AMA up top, I have ~2K of something written, I know you teach writing classes occasionally (watched your Youtube videos <3 ) a glance would make my day.</p>

									<p>Mistborn didn't contain any explicit sexual themes but did have gore. I would have no trouble recommending it to a YA reader. Did you go about changing your style/tone/whatever for something like <i>The Rithmatist</i> that is geared more towards YA or is it mostly the same?</p>

									<p>The whole YA movement is a difficult one to parse in sf/f. We have a grand history of books that might be packaged right now as YA. Would Shannara be YA if published today? What about the Belgariad? I think you could make arguments for both.</p>

<p>At the core of designing a story, I don't think about which audience it is for. I design something I think is interesting and fun. However, during the writing process, I think it is appropriate to consider audience. In a YA book, I will focus more on the younger protagonists and their viewpoints. I will also generally try to streamline the story&mdash;not dumbing it down, but keeping my attention on a more focused narrative.</p>

									<p>Hi, I'm a male writer writing fantasy at the moment with a female perspective character. I'm having trouble with the tone whenever my character bumps up against barriers women have to deal with in my universe. I don't want to beat my audience over the head with gender issues or come off as preachy, especially as I'm still new to writing a female character.</p>

<p>My question is, when you were writing your female characters, especially Vin who jumped out at me as a natural but strong female protagonist in a male character dominated genre, did you find her voice came from your previous writing experience, or did you consult much with other authors and/or women you knew? I keep feeling like I should consult some female friends on how I'm writing her, but I don't want to lose my own voice in doing so.</p>

<p>Also, I love your novels. I find fantasy is a genre filled with characters who feel like tropes or someone's DnD character, while your characters jump off the page and walk around. If you have any general tips for writing a realistic person, that would be great. If not, just thanks for writing such great people.</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I do consult with others. I think it's vital, particularly when writing 'the other' so to speak. Someone who is different from yourself in some fundamental way.</p>

<p>At the same time, every character should be different from yourself in some fundamental way. And, beyond that, there's a trap in thinking "My character has to think like a woman." No, your character has to think like herself. That's an important distinction to make. For every generalization, grouping, or stereotype out there, you can find many, many people who break that mold.</p>

<p>I actually focus on personality, wants, and needs first. Gender is a part of the character as a concept, and it informs how I write the person—but it is secondary to their passions, goals, and temperament.</p>

<p>I'd say write the character first, then consult with your female friends. Let them read the character in the context of her story, and get a read on it. So long as the character is strong and individual, you should be fine. Some pointers will undoubtedly help, of course.</p>

<p>The best way I've found to make someone realistic is to separate them from the plot and ask yourself who they are, and what they'd be doing, if the plot had never come along and swallowed them up.</p>

									<p>Hey Brandon! Big fan, and a regular listener to the very insightful Writing Excuses. I recently took all your talk about making time to write to heart and have since found a way to juggle my career, life, and MBA study in order to write. Over the past 6 weeks, I've done about 50k words and still managed to stay on top of everything. So, I guess I'm saying thanks to you, Mary, Howard, and Dan for the kick in the butt I needed to get to writing!</p>

									<p>You've said that while many of your books are interconnected "behind the scenes", you didn't want to put too much in the books themselves so readers didn't feel like they're missing information (HIGHLY paraphrased).

									<p>Hey Brandon!!!! Here's my question, and I fully expect you'll never get to it, so no worries on that account.</p>

<p>We live in an era of instant gratification and fleeting interests. Relationships that once lasted a lifetime, such as marriages, sometimes come and go in years or even months. Readers' commitment to long range tales, such as the Wheel of Time, now often outlasts their commitments to spouses and careers. What do you think it is about these epic fantasies that draws people in and keeps them coming back for literally decades of their lives? Good luck on not wearing out your typing fingers on these questions! </p>

									<p>Robin! Hey, hope you're having a cool AMA yourself today.</p>

<p>You ask a very interesting question, one I haven't thought nearly enough about. For me, the Wheel of Time was like the high school friend that stayed with me. As relationships drifted apart, as I stopped being able to see many of the people I knew back then, I could always come back to the Wheel of Time and find some of my old friends. Perhaps that has something to do with it.</p>

<p>There was also, of course, the sense of, "I have to know the ending." I know I've met more than one reader who expressed this as the reason they kept going all those years.</p>

<p>There's just something wonderful about the constant like this in our lives.</p>

									<p>Hey Brandon. Just now finding out about this AMA so I don't know if you will answer this but I really must know something.</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if you still plan on doing a sequel to <i>Warbreaker</i> one day. I just want to say that Vivenna was my favorite character and had my favorite arc. I remember you saying in the annotations that you were worried that people would be disappointed with a sequel starring Vivenna but I just wanted you to know that at least this guy would not be disappointed.</p>

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>Good to know! Thanks.

<p>Yes, the <i>Warbreaker</i> sequel will happen&mdash;but it's near the bottom of my list at the moment. (I'm sorry.) I want to make certain the Stormlight Archive doesn't languish first.</p>

									<p>I generally stay away from reading fanfiction done on my work, for various reasons, though I don't have a problem with people writing it. I think the coolest thing is when I get fanart from the books; it helps me understand how people are visualizing my characters, and it gives me a boost to see that what I've written has inspired other artists.</p>

									<p>Finally, looking at the Future Mistborn Trilogy, what role will the "gods" play in that? The "gods" played a massive role in the original series, being a main character.

									<p>Hi Brandon, I was wondering, considering that we are supposed to be living now in the First Age, I was wondering what RJ took to be the end of the Fifth Age and the Breaking?

									<p>Hey Brandon, just one question I have.</p>

<p>Why didn't you continue with <i>Warbreaker</i> as a series? Seriously the best characters you have made are in that book IMO (though I haven't read <i>Elantris</i> yet, I've read everything else you have made).</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>The primary reason is because the story doesn't cry for an immediate sequel, while <i>Way of Kings</i> did. That forces me to prioritize Stormlight. But I will eventually get to another <i>Warbreaker</i> book.</p>

									<p>Hay Brandon, Huge fan! Finished <i>A Memory of Light</i>, Re-read all 3 Mistborn for the 2nd time, re-read <i>Way of Kings</i> for the 4th time and am currently listening to <i>Alloy of Law</i> while I toil away at work. Also recently listened to all of season one of Writing Excuses, very cool stuff please keep doing it, maybe a live podcast from SDCC this year?</p>

<p>I also wanted to mention I met you last year at SDCC on preview night and I'm working on that Memento. http://i.imgur.com/tve4Xqv.jpg</p>

<p>To the questions...I believe I've heard you mention more than once that you weren't happy with <i>Way of Kings</i>, could you explain a bit exactly what you would change or love to do-over with it or expand on your comments?

<p>Also, any teasers for the new Stormlight archive?</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>The problem with doing something live like that at SDCC is that it's really hard to get the space or work out the logistics. We keep talking about it, but have trouble making it happen. Everyone is just so BUSY there. But maybe!</p>

<p>The original draft of <i>The Way of Kings</i> had some big issues. One of the largest ones was that I was trying to do too many characters with too many separate plots. (Jasnah and Taln both had full sequences with as much complexity as the three main characters in the current draft.) Beyond that, Kaladin's character (he had a different name there) was bland and never worked. I needed to rebuild him from the start.</p>

<p>I'll post more explanations of this in the <i>Kings</I> annotations, which I'm working on right now. As for teasers for the second book, one of the interludes is from Taln's viewpoint. (He's the guy who shows up in the epilogue of the previous book.)</p>

									<p>Why is there only one Chasm line per Aon? Since each Aon is made up of repetitions of Aon Aon, shouldn't there be a Chasm line per repetition?</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>The Aons aren't JUST made up of repetitions of Aon Aon. There's a lot more to them than that. Some follow a repetition pattern, others do not. The only requirement is using the initial Aon once, then building from there. Because of this, I made the new requirement be only one use of the chasm line.</p>

<p>Aons can actually have multiple forms and still work. For example, if you drew the chasm line on each one of those Aons, they'd work fine. (Maybe even better, in some cases.) What is happening in the books is that the Aons are ALMOST functional, and the Dor is straining to come through them. The chasm line brings them the one step further they need to be functional. However, further tweaking could make them more efficient.</p>

<p>Which of your protagonist characters do you dislike the most as a person? Taking into account that you know all of their inner secrets and motivations.</p>

<p>On the flip side. Which of your antagonists do you connect with the most? The Lord Ruler seems an obvious choice as he was misunderstood by everybody for so long. But still, I'm curious.</p>

									<p>Hi Brandon,</p>

<p>First of all, just wanted to say that I love your work. I got hooked with <i>Elantris</i> and have felt the need to purchase all your other books as a result. Also, fantastic job with handling the WoT series!</p>

<p>I'm curious on your thoughts regarding the self-publishing market. I've always had an interest in writing fiction and have finally completed my first novella. As a person with a full-time job, I'm seriously considering self-publishing rather than finding an agent to represent me, and attempting to market through the internet.</p>

<p>So, how do you feel about the self-publishing route, rather than the publisher-agent-writer trifecta?</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I think self-publishing is a perfectly viable option these days, and has many things to recommend it. For a novella in particular, it can be one of the best ways to get your work out there.</p>

<p>I cover some of the differences in depth, by my perspective, as one of the latter writing lectures at WriteAboutDragons. (Those are videos a grad student posted of my lectures for a class project he's working on.)</p>

<p>The long and short is, however, that I think you are wise to consider both options. If I were breaking in right now, I'd probably try both methods.</p>

									<p>Wow. I don't know what to say other than that. I'm glad you got the help you need, my friend. Depression is a pernicious beast. I wish you the best.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing this, and I know exactly how you feel about the characters.</p>

									<p>Brandon, I'm a huge fan of <i>The Way of Kings</i> and met you at GenCon last year. Would you ever consider offering a license for a <i>Way Of Kings</i> Board Game or a Mistborn cardgame? It wouldn't take any of your time and we would give you full final approval on the game too. I gave you a couple of our games as well as my card but I know you are very busy and probably hit by this sort of request all the time.</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I'd certainly consider it. (Did you email me too?) The trick is, I'm worried about jumping the gun on <i>Kings</i> licensing. I only have one book out in the series so far. I intend to be writing in this world for a while. I'd rather that a game come later, once more about the story/setting/characters is known so that the game is more true to the soul of the series.</p>

									<p>Excellent question. The shards are now intermingled, and would take effort to split apart. He would drop Harmony. (This is what Odium feared would happen, by the way.)</p>

									<p>I am a big fan and, being a wife to an aspiring author, I sometimes think about what your schedule must be like for your family. Sometimes you talk about twelve hour work days and I'm wondering do you get to spend a decent amount of time with your wife and children?</p>

<p>Also, I am currently reading <i>Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians</i> and this book is sheer wit. Sadly, the cover has made me uninterested for years. I actually first saw the book at the 7th Harry Potter midnight opening party at the Border's in Provo. We've all heard not to judge a book by its cover but, seriously, do you have any say in the cover art or is it one of those things you just have to sign over?</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Balancing this can be hard, but it's not so bad now that I'm published. I work long hours some days, but I always steal the extra time from leisure, not family. I finish work at 5:30 most days, hang with family until nine or ten, then go back to work. The lack of a commute makes it so that long hours don't really steal time from the family, which is very important.</p>

<p>I would say that it's harder for an aspiring author. I'd suggest that your husband make specific writing goals, and section off time—and everyone agree to leave that time alone. (Whether it be four hours on a Saturday each week, or an hour at night when everyone else is watching TV.) It can be done in a way that doesn't leave the family lonely, but it requires careful management.</p>

<p>As for the cover of <i>Alcatraz</i>...no, I'm not fond of it. I never have been. This was very early in my career, however, when I didn't have much influence over such things. We did complain as the covers to the series got worse and worse, but our complaints fell on deaf ears.</p>

									<p>Hey Brandon, thanks for doing this AMA! I am a huge fan of your writing, and love how you seem to understand that a good story does not have to be completely unique. What really irritates me about a lot of modern scifi is a lot of the new stories coming out seem to to try so hard for "uniqueness" that they literally do not copy anything that has been done before. When in fact by leaving out these "common" elements their story really suffers IMO. As a sucker for epic fantasy with great character development I thank you for putting books out that inspire me.</p>

<p>Lastly, have you ever considered writing a superhero-esque type book? I love the way you flesh out your characters, and I know it may be a little one dimensional for your tastes, but I feel you have a gift for taking something simple and making it complex, yet eloquent. (Also I know my grammar sucks so I hope you do not to cringe too much when/if you read this lol)</p>

									<p>Everyone has their own "ideal" when it comes to the balance between the familiar and the innovative. My goal is almost always to walk right down the middle, some familiar tropes, some innovation. Those were the stories I enjoyed the most reading.</p>

<p>Regarding superheroes, as has been mentioned, watch for <i>Steelheart</i>. The premise is that people start gaining super-powers, but only evil people get them.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

									<p>Have you read the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind? Honest opinion?</p>

<p>It's pretty popular, I'm not sure but maybe at or beyond WoT levels, and I read it and wanted to tear my hair out by the end, can't believe I actually got that far. The first couple were ok, good even, then it started with the 30 page speaches and repetition and re-describing every character every time they were on screen as if he couldn't fill enough pages.</p>

									<p>Not sure if this question has already been posted. Which author would you say has influenced your writing the most? From deciding to be an author to making you write like you do. You are my favorite author right now and therefore what made you decide to start and to have the style of writing that I so love.</p>
 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>It's really hard to judge the MOST influential. <i>Dragonsbane</i> by Barbara Hambly was the book that got me into fantasy, and the Dragonriders of Pern books kept me there. My favorite classic is <i>Les Miserables</i>. Tad Williams, Robert Jordan, and Melanie Rawn were very influential on me during my early years as a writer.</p>

<p>My style came as a mix of many of the things I was reading, as a reaction against some elements—and toward others. Brent Weeks, I've noticed, has a very similar style to my own, particularly in his Lightbringer books. I believe we're both products of the same era and books.</p>



<h4><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ced7z/iamstilla_novelist_named_brandon_sanderson_ama/ccng2iw">Phantine</a></h4>
<p>Did you read any Steven Brust? He's got a recurring character who cameos in every book, and a repeated number with great mystical significance (17, not 16). And, of course, lots of snarky conversations.</p>

<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I don't read as much Brust as I should, but what I have read has been excellent.</p>
