									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									[So in the <i>Alloy of Law</i>, you mention it being an in between book. You said you're writing] another Trilogy set? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Yes. I had this whole series that was outlined. This [<i>Alloy of Law</i>] was not in the outline, it was from fun, and I really enjoyed writing it, but it's not part of the series. It's three sets of three. And I may do other things like <i>Alloy of Law</i>, but <i>Alloy</i> was just for fun.</p>
<p>I don't know if you know this, but all my fantasy books are connected. There are repeating characters involved, but you have to search to find them. And the Mistborn Trilogy is kind of interconnected with that. Particularly with the third trilogy. The Science Fiction one.</p>									</div>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									I have to admit, I've read everything except for your Wheel of Time books, because I'm having a hard time getting through book 11, I lose track of all the characters, and the plot. 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>I know how you feel. If you ever decide that you want to get back in them, there is the WoT Encyclopedia which has chapter summaries for all the books, so you can jump right into book 12. There's another one called WoT summary that's very good too.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What's the release date? January 3rd?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>January 8th. Or 9th.</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>8th.</p>
<h4>Brandon</h4>
<p>8th. These guys know better than I do.</p>									</div>

									The Mistborn RPG is really cool.

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									How do you come up with magic systems? Particularly Allomancy and Feruchemy. 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									Feruchemy and Allomancy were designed separately, and I put them together which was sort of an interesting thing. Allomancy basically came from my readings of Alchemy and my readings about Biology. And metabolizing things to get energy. It felt very natural to be burning metals. Weird, but natural. When I started writing it out, it worked so well. I wanted something that had a scientific component and a magical component. Does that make sense? 									</div>

<p>Not yet. The name's still the Bad Name. [explains to others]. In my notes it's called <i>The Book of Endless Pages</i>, because that's the book Shallan gets at the end of Book 1, but the problem is that it's kind of a silly title for a book this long.</p>

																		<div>
									Well, my first book came out in 2005, so I would've been.... 30? But I was writing from age 21. That's when I really started seriously writing. I dabbled a little bit on my mission on my P-days, with permission from my mission president, and then really started seriously when I got back sophomore year of college, and wrote my first book that year I got back. And that one didn't get published. But it wasn't any good, so it's good it didn't get published. And then I just wrote over the next 9 years, wrote and wrote and wrote till I finally sold one. 									</div>

									<p>[to fan whose book he's signing] So who's this book for?</p>
<h4>Fan</h4>
<p>For my friend at BYU-I.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>My sister goes to BYU-I. She's 24? She just graduated.</p> 
<h4>Fan</h4>
<p>What's her major?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Secondary Education with a Science Focus. In fact, I think she's doing her student teaching this semester.</p>
<h4>Fan</h4>
<p>So you were originally a Chemistry major, right?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I was. And I really liked all the concepts, but the math killed me. The math was so hard, and I didn't enjoy the busywork of it, and that was a big deciding factor for me. I wanted to do something that I enjoyed the busy work. And you know, no one likes everything. There are times in writing where it's hard. And you get up in the morning and you'd rather just play video games instead of work, but it doesn't matter what you're going to do, that's going to happen, but all in all, even the little stuff in writing I love, so I switched to trying to be a writer. And it worked out for me eventually.</p>
<h4>Fan</h4>
<p>The class you teach at BYU, is that only for graduate students?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>No, it's open to anyone, but grad students get to register first. And because of that, they tend to grab a lot of the seats. I do add a lot on the first day. What I usually do is I ask people how much they've written, and the people who have done the most writing will probably benefit the most from the class, so I let them have a place. So if you go to BYU, are you at BYU right now?</p>
<h4>Fan</h4>
<p>I'm at BYU-I, but I'm probably going to transfer. But he wants to take it. What's the title of the class?
Brandon: How to write Science Fiction and Fantasy. English 318. If you want to get in the class, take a year, write a book or two, and then when I say, who's written the most books, most people have not written any. And so if you've written one or two, your chances of getting the slot in the class go drastically up.</p>
<h4>Fan</h4>
<p>Maybe children books.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah. They can be children's books. Not picture books. Picture books are too easy. [laughter] Well, not easy. But easy to write poorly.</p>									</div>

																		<div>
									So is there a third law of magic?

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>Yes there is. I don't have a pithy way to say it yet.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Do you want to try to describe it anyways?</p>
<h4>Brandon</h4>
<p>Yeah, the best magic systems are interconnected with the world, with society, with culture, and the development of the setting of a book. The next level you want to think about is how does your magic affect your gender roles, how does it affect your government, your religions, all these things.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>They all have to be interconnected.</p>
<h4>Brandon</h4>
<p>Yes. But I don't have a pithy way to say it, so once I come up with a good pithy way to say it, then I can actually write it.</p>									</div>

<p>I feel kind of silly because it actually is a pun. And the entire Mistborn trilogy is therefore based on a pun. The first paragraph of the first chapter. But you know, if you can't tell from me naming my character Wax and Wayne, that I have a slight problem with puns.</p>

																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									Practice. Lots of practice. It was much harder to do that early on, but I've had lots of practice, and so I know that when it's not working, I know why it's not working. Sometimes when it's not working it's because I'm just having a bad day. I need to try it the next day. Sometimes when it's not working, Something fundamental is wrong with the book. Sometimes, it's just the scene is in the wrong place or isn't active enough. And this one wasn't active enough. I set it in a way that people were just sitting around too much, and I had to scrap all that rework it so that there would be conflict and motion.									</div>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									Any spoilers for <i>A Memory of Light</i>? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Let's see here. Harriet killed <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#11">a character</a> in the book that I did not intend to kill. So I wrote the entire book with a character living and she killed this character.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Did she tell you right before you finished, or what?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>She sent back the draft and said "This person dies."</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So did you have to change a lot?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>So they succumb to their wounds. I intended them to live, so there is a character who died unexpectedly. So that's a slight spoiler. There is like a chapter that's over a hundred pages. It's a Super Chapter.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Did you have to invent any of it yourself, or did Jordan leave a lot of it for you?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>He left some of it for me, and then I had to make the rest. As you're reading through the books, probably about half and half. Half will be stuff that he wrote notes on, half will be stuff that I wrote.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Do you feel like it comes pretty easy?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Some of it does. I mean I've been reading since I was a kid. So some of the characters like Perrin is very natural for me. And Rand's super natural for me. Others are a little less natural for me.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Like Mat.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yes, like Mat. Mat's harder for me to write.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Because Mat is very complex. Not to say that Perrin's not, but Perrin's straightforward. You know what I mean? Perrin says what he means, and does what he means. Mat says the opposite of what he means, and does the opposite of what he says. Making that tone correct for that is very hard. He's one part rapscallion, the other part Awesomeness. And balancing when he's playing the fool, and when he's just being awesome is very hard to get that balance down, because you don't want it to be silly, you know he can play the fool a bit but he shouldn't be silly. Otherwise it won't match from when he's being Awesome as well, if that makes sense.</p>									</div>

									<div>As to whether or not Demandred's alter ego has been seen on screen, Brandon himself <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=479#6">extended</a> RJ's comment through <i>Knife of Dreams</i>, and he later <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#7">said</a> that Demandred wasn't seen in <i>Towers of Midnight</i> at all. That, combined with this comment here where he lumps his books together makes it clear that <b>Demandred's alter ego has never been seen on screen.</b> (A <a href="http://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=The_Gathering_Storm_Character_List#First_Appearance">list</a> of characters introduced in <i>The Gathering Storm</i>, some of whom are disqualified by appearing in <i>Towers of Midnight</i>, helps to make that point.) Other <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=139#3">comments</a> by RJ make it clear that <b>we should be able to figure out who it is by <i>Winter's Heart</i> at the latest</b>, and Brandon has also <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#23">said</a> <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=773#4">several</a> <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#44">times</a> that it can be figured out from the books.

									Why is Dashiva never resurrected? He was killed with a ball of fire by Elza, not balefire....

																		<h4>

																		<div>
									<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<h4>Loialson</h4>
<p>Why is he dead?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Robert Jordan once said that res...transmigrating a soul had not just to do with the way that they were killed but the time and...not necessarily just a weave, but why and how. [Technically, <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=43#5">where and how</a>.] I am not going to delve too much into transmigration. Robert Jordan <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#3">did speak</a> on these sorts of things. And so, the Dark One also might not think that the person was an asset worth bringing back.</p>
<h4>Loialson</h4>
<p>Dashiva kinda sucks.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I'm not gonna say, but those are all factors in this.</p>									</div>

									<p>As far as I know, no. Now, that's the sort of thing that could be buried in the notes, but you know, I've read a lot of them, and as far as I know, no, that's not the purpose.</p>

<p>Um, Rand...um...</p>

<p>That felt like a big waste to me.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah. I was...I will RAFO that. But I will say that they did have a specific intention. How about, here's something I can give you...it's actually <a href="http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#21">backing up a few questions</a>. I've mentioned online that we're probably going to—for a certain anthology, the <i>Unfettered</i> anthology—we are going to be putting deleted scenes from <I>A Memory of Light</i> and some of these deleted scenes will answer some of your questions.
<h4>Loialson</h4>
<p>That's exciting. Thank you.<p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I don't think there's an official announcement; I don't think Harriet has decided 100% to make the announcement, but I've mentioned online before in things that we were considering it, and so, some deleted scenes having to do with some of your questions are actually going to be in this <i>Unfettered</i> anthology, and they may be from the viewpoint of a certain Forsaken that everyone's very curious about.</p>									</div>

									<p>Next fall. If I'm on the ball. That's not supposed to rhyme, but it did.  Tor said they'd put it out next fall if I turn it in on time.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>When is turn in time?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>April. They said if I get it to them in April, we'll be fine. The trick is, for Michael Whelan to do the cover, I need to give him a cover scene like next month. Because Michael takes his time, because he's the best artist in the business, so you need to turn stuff in early. So I need to decide "What's the cover going to be", and come up with a fantastic cover scene for it. </p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So is it finished? Is the book finished?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>You can follow on my website, I'm at 7% right now. I have to turn it in in April, so if I can get to 100% by April (or 110% knowing Brandon) we'll be all right. If we can't than it gets a little more sketchy.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Is that turning in the first draft?</p>

<h4>Andre</h4>
<p>Can you give him any tips to write faster?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Well, Pat is, he's very into beautiful prose, this is his thing. And it shows. And you can't do that fast. My prose is not as beautiful, my prose is translucent is what I try to do. I try to write prose so you don't see it, and you see the story. And that prose can go faster. And it's just a matter of writing style. I actually envy his prose sometimes, and he envies my speed.</p>
<h4>Andre</h4>
<p>I imagine.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>But, I think the third one will be faster. After the first one came out he ended up with this huge performance anxiety problem because the first one took off so much; that he couldn't even write for a year because he was so stressed about how well the book had done. He got over that. And he doesn't have that anymore. So theoretically the next book should be faster. He did sign for three more books, right?</p>
<h4>Andre</h4>
<p>He signed for a new trilogy...</p>
<h4>Josh</h4>
<p>Which one would hope means he's getting close to done with the one he's in the middle of. We can all hope.</p>									</div>

<p>I was going to say generalities. Does that cover the basics of it?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>That definitely covers the basics of it, yeah. There was stuff from Sazed's metalminds. A lot of that stuff that was in there. Everything that was in there, he tried to get in the books. And then some other additions. Such as Elendel, which he created as a basin for life and things. And stuff like that. They are very interesting.

																		<div>
									How does one make sense of Spook's High Imperial? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									One thing about High Imperial, or Eastern Street Slang, is that it was devised by those who spoke it in order to be intentionally obtuse. So it was hard for people to understand. And so there are a lot of nonsense words thrown in the middle. But, it's also got reversed grammar. ‘Wasing the wanting of doing the thing' is ‘I wanted to do that.' But you can also throw random words in there. As long as those parts are in there, it'll make sense to those they're speaking to. ‘I wanted to do this. Wasing the wanting of doing the thing.' You're putting everything into a gerund. You're starting with the verb and the tense. And you're turning everything into ridiculously bad gerunds. That's it in brief.									</div>

									<h4>																				Question																			</h4>
																		
																		<div>
									I heard you're doing another Mistborn Trilogy? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Yes.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Any estimate when the first book might be?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4> 
<p>I might do some more <i>Alloy of Law</i> era things in between, they are not the second trilogy, but I will do them. The second trilogy will come between the break between  the first sequence in the Stormlight Archive, and the second sequence of the Stormlight Archive. it's two five book sequences, and during that break I will stop and do the second Mistborn trilogy. So it will depend on how quickly I can write those.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>So when exactly would the second Mistborn trilogy take place relative to <i>Alloy of Law</i>?
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Late 20th century era. Modern technology.</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>I've heard that's like... 50? years after <i>Alloy of Law</i>.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah, right around there. Roughly. Not quite information age, is what I was looking at. So there's no direct equivalent, because the different technology aspects, but you would see it as something around the 80s. Maybe early 90s. Allomancer SWAT team is what it's about.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Okay, that's exciting.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>First book is a Mistborn serial killer versus an Allomancer SWAT team. With deeper ramifications to everything.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Is Dan helping you with the psychology on that one?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Uh, I actually haven't yet gotten his help on a [profile?] yet.</p>									</div>

									<p>I bought the rights back from the publisher, I didn't like how they were being handled.

																		<div>
									How do you come up with your magic systems? Do you just open the dictionary and point to a word? "Oh, I'll make something with that." 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>No, I'm always looking for something that strikes me. And I'm looking for things that haven't been done before. Things that will make nice conflict, that walk the line between science and superstition.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>That's what I love, that it's all super scientific but it also has magic.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>If you will Google Sanderson's First Law, and Sanderson's Second Law, I have two essays that I wrote about how I do magic. They're both on my website, but Google will find them easier than trying to find them on my website.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Did you ever read Master of 5 magics? </p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I did. That's old school.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Yeah, not great stories, but wonderful magic.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yep. Great magic. That's what I felt about them too.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>When will the next Mistborn (<i>Alloy of Law</i> era) come out?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>It will probably come out after the next <i>Way of Kings</i>. Next <i>Way of Kings</i> is next Christmas, the next <i>Alloy of Law</i> era book is probably the following Spring or something like that.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Are you planning two more or three more?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I will do as many of those as strikes me. The <i>Alloy of Law</i> books are a deviation from the main world plotline.</p> So it's just for fun. I'm not going to commit to how many I'll do or not do. Just whatever's working.</p>									</div>

									So what's up with the regeneration issue?  
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>[looks confused]</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>With Shards? Because they only have so much power they can access at a certain time, but yet they still have more energy. So how does that work? Is it just they have so much power they can use at any given time?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>[still slightly confused] What are you talking about? Like which shards?</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>Ruin and Preservation. Since we know the most about them.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Ruin and Preservation were a specific instance, because almost all their energy was thrown into resisting each other. Keep that in mind. Even after Preservation was only a shadow, basically all of it was "Let's keep Ruin from destroying the world". So they were polar opposites. Set in balance. But slightly unbalanced in a couple of ways, that eventually, that slight imbalance [led to the Mistborn Trilogy]. They are a special case, because of that.</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>So then why are they hesitant to directly fuel Allomancy?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Why are they hesitant to? What do you mean by directly fuel Allomancy?</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>You mention in the <i>Hero of Ages</i> Q&A that they can directly fuel Allomancy, like Vin does with Elend, but it requires expending their energy in a way they are hesitant to do.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Because it imbalances them more. Does that make sense? So if you are putting your energy here, rather than fighting the other force, that gives them an edge somewhere else, while trying to gain an edge here. And you have to make sure that's really worth it. Like a chess game. Is it worth sacrificing my pawn here to expose myself over here.</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>That makes sense.</p>									</div>

									<p>Correct.</p>

<p>People have been thrown by you saying that Odium is not native to Roshar.</p>

<p>Odium is not native, that's the thing. Are any of them native? So if you dig the deeper question, are any of them native, ehhh, none of them are native to the planets you've seen so far. What I probably should've said to be more precise is that Honor and Cultivation were there long before Odium showed up.</p>									</div>

									That's it. Oh wait, we can do this ridiculous one. There's this crazy off the wall theory that Parshendi are dead people brought back to life.  
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Interesting. There will be Parshendi viewpoints in the second book, and you will be able to see a lot more of that.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Are Parshendi like a hive mind sort of culture?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4> 
<p>They are not a hive mind. I thought people might assume that.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>But because of the singing, it seems like...</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>There is a connection. It's more Union than Hivemind. You know about Jung?</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Not particularly.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Jung's philosophy was that all people are connected.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Oh, like the dream psychologist?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I believe that collective unconscious was one of his terms. So it's not hive mind, but there is—there's something the Parshendi can tap into.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>With the singing?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Yeah, like with the singing, where one sings over here, and one sings over there, they are actually in beat with one another even if they start at different times. So there is something there, a connection.</p>									</div>

									What about Aon Rii? Talk about Aon Rii. What are the random dots? Are they valuable metals? 
									</div>
																		
																		<h4>
																														Brandon Sanderson																			</h4>
																		<div>
									<p>Honestly, I don't remember. [laughter] I'll be straight up honest with you, I designed the Aons—When I designed the Aons, they all had things like that. Like "Oh, that's what this will be," but I was not as good about taking notes of things then. I didn't have the wiki that I now have.</p>
<h4>Josh</h4>
<p>What I would give for one hour with that wiki.</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>I didn't have all of that stuff, so I can say "Yeah, that's going to be valuable metals", and canonize it that way, but I don't remember what I was actually thinking when I designed it. It was my first time doing anything like that, like [?] sort of thing. I hadn't ever done anything like that before, so I was just flying by the seat of my pants.</p>
<p>In fact, there's a fun story about that, a story I don't think I told during the annotations, I might have. Originally, I wrote it, and used all the Aons as like little things about characters' personalities.</p>
<h4>Zas</h4>
<p>Really?</p>
<h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
<p>Like Rao is spirit, and Ene (eenee) is wit. Well, all the other ones were things like that, to the point that the traitor character, his Aon's the one that meant Betrayal. Like this, all the characters have little things like that. And then my editor saw it and said "Ah. Do you really want to give away everyone's personality? And who's going to name their kid Betrayal? And I was like "That was really stupid Brandon, why did you do that?" But at the time, I didn't know if I was going to have a dictionary in the back or anything, and so I had to go back and rename almost all of them. I left Rao and Ene, but I renamed almost all the—renamed the wrong word. I shifted all the meanings and things like this so that everyone would have a name that would make sense that you would name a person. And none of them meant anything more than what they actually mean.</p>									</div>
