## Entry #1

#### Jason Denzel

Today is Robert Jordan's birthday. What do you think he'll do today? We asked and he said:

#### Robert Jordan

Thanks for the Happy Birthday greeting. There won't be any fishing today—we're a little betwixt and between here on things biting; October is too late in the year for some, too early for others—but it's been a great birthday so far. Lots of neat presents from various people. And I'll only work half a day, since Harriet is taking me to see Mystic River and then out to supper at my favorite Thai restaurant. All in all, a lazy but enjoyable day.

Have fun, RJ!
