## Entry #1

#### Matt Hatch

Here is a report of the questions we were able to ask Jordan during the book signings over the last few days. There is too much to report, but this should be a good slice of information for everyone to chew on.

Questions by Isabel at Book Signing:

## Entry #2

#### Isabel

Since you said Galad fancied Nynaeve first. But in
*The Great Hunt*
I thought he fancied Egwene first because he asked Egwene for a walk in the garden.

#### Robert Jordan

Galad just thought Egwene was pretty and that it would be nice to walk with her. (Harriet added that it doesn't always have to be love at first sight.)

#### Isabel

I wanted to ask RJ some more about the Galad fancied Nynaeve thing. I searched up the quotes in book two that pointed to Egwene. (Didn't have three with me and no good access to internet or my notes.) With this answer I really think there are much more relations and mistaken thought by characters than we thought. Gawyn thought Galad fancied Egwene, remember...And not all quotes are what they seem to be. I think 90 percent of the people or even more just assumed the Elayne quote was a mistake. I certainly did!!!

Questions by Isabel at Book Signing, 9/4/05:

## Entry #4

#### Isabel

Nynaeve was born with the spark, right?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Isabel

Because yesterday there was a question about Learners...somebody who is not born with the spark, but is born with the ability to learn, could they begin channeling unconsciously?

#### Robert Jordan

No, they could not, they would have to make a conscious effort. They could make a conscious effort without a teacher and maybe succeed, but without a teacher they've got a very small chance of actually doing it.

## Entry #8

#### Matt Hatch

Questions WSB asked at Book Signing, 9/4/05:

## Entry #9

#### Ted Herman

Is Shaidar Haran an avatar to the world beyond the Bore?

#### Robert Jordan

I am not certain you can really call him an avatar because I generally think of an avatar as having exactly the same powers as, and it is not, Shaidar Haran does not have nearly as much power as the Dark One. It's as though the Dark One is able to project a shadowy form of himself into this creature. It is the Dark One in shadowy form.

#### Ted Herman

Is it twenty-four seven, or just part time?

#### Robert Jordan

Twenty-four seven.

#### Ted Herman

Ohh.

#### Harriet

Shaidar Haran has another life in the suburbs.

#### Ted Herman

Yeah, he has two and half little fades running around.

#### Harriet

He has to go home for the weekend to cut the grass. I don't think so.

## Entry #10

#### Ted Herman

How old is Taim and has he slowed?

#### Robert Jordan

Taim has slowed, but one thing I am not going to reveal it in the books, so I'll tell you, men slow later than women do. And yes, he has slowed, and he is in his late twenties, yes his late twenties.

## Entry #11

#### Matt Hatch

Questions Tam asked at Book Signing, 9/3/05?

## Entry #12

#### Matt Hatch

You have been killing my theories left and right since I got here.

#### Robert Jordan

I have always thought that the small whimper of a theory as it dies is a beautiful sound.

(General laughter all around.)

#### Matt Hatch

Ouch. Okay, now that you have killed my black cord theory, are the oaths and covenants Forsaken make with the Dark One necessary for the Dark One to transmigrate a soul?

#### Robert Jordan

They are not necessary, but he is not likely to do it for anyone who hasn't done, who hasn't sworn to him.

#### Matt Hatch

He doesn't have access to all souls to be able to grab any soul?

#### Robert Jordan

No, no, no. Because of the Bore and the fact that the bore is best perceived, the Bore doesn't really exist in Shayol Ghul, the Bore exists everywhere, it's simply in Shayol Ghul where it can be perceived most easily. By the same token he has greater access to people at Shayol Ghul than he does elsewhere, or did, and uh, that's, when you know, Rahvin died, Rahvin is balefired out of time, slain out of time, cannot be reached, gone. Be'lal, (names someone else).

#### Matt Hatch

Well, then is there something unique about the Forsaken other than the fact that they are his favorites that he would transmigrate them, or be able to?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, he would have been a lot less likely to in an earlier time when they were a lot of powerful knowledgeable channelers who were in his service. Essentially half the people in the world who could channel were on his side, during the War of the Shadow. Now he has very few, he's got the Black Ajah, and a few wilders, and some stuff I ain't going in to, but uh he doesn't have a lot, but he can't afford to waste assets.

#### Matt Hatch

Okay.

## Entry #13

#### Isabel

Have you started writing the next book already?

#### Robert Jordan

In a sort of desultory way, working, the week after I handed in the final manuscript, and sent it off to New York, I started working half day here, three quarter day there, a half day again.

#### Matt Hatch

Well, I am hoping for that fifteen hundred page book.

#### Robert Jordan

It may be—I am not saying it will be that big—and I will fight them doing a George R.R Martin on me.

#### Matt Hatch

Yeah, please do.

how many more books?

## Entry #14

#### Camel

Yeah, where's your hat? Your little, in your picture, I was really looking forward to seeing the hat.

#### Robert Jordan

I didn't bring the black one this time, I brought a brown one. I thought it might get rained on a lot.

#### Camel

I was really looking forward to the hat.

The Finns reside in a Parallel World, is that correct?

## Entry #18

#### [Isabel (later)](http://theoryland.yuku.com/topic/9911/hehe-a-not-so-very-interesting-question-asked#.UB3OG0SXPA8)

I just remembered one question I asked RJ. And I thought I didn't include it. I asked if Calian and Shivan are born at the end of every Age.

#### Robert Jordan

As far as I remember the answer was yes. ;)

#### Isabel

I think I also asked if they are already born, but that must have been a RAFO. :)

Not very interesting, but perhaps another Theorylander was with me at that time. ;) (I thought I didn't include it [in an earlier report], but I am not 100 percent sure. :p )

## Entry #19

#### [Matt Hatch (Reported later)](http://13depository.blogspot.com/2009/03/dragoncon-05-reports.html)

Did Lanfear and Verin have any contact, and if not did Verin give Egwene the
*ter'angreal*
of her own free will?

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah she gave it with her own free will and choice. And no contact between Lanfear and Verin.
