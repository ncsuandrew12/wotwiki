## Entry #1

#### Terez

The
[original report](http://forums.dragonmount.com/index.php/topic,50071.msg1360812.html#msg1360812)
has gone missing. I'm hoping to hear back from Claireducky one day on whether or not she saved a copy of the report, but these Q&A are reconstructed from the old interview database, which means that only plot-related questions were saved.

## Entry #2

#### Claire

Is Laras Mesaana?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RJ once stated that Mesaana had not been seen on screen in her assumed identity yet as of the end of
*Knife of Dreams*
. And we see Laras in
*New Spring*
.

#### Muirenn and Az

But is the Laras in
*New Spring*
the same as the Laras we see now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*laughs\* RAFO.

#### Footnote

This was directly contradicted by
[earlier reports](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=174#2)
on RJ signings, and Brandon cleared it up
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#1)
: Mesaana's alter ego
*had*
been seen 'on screen', and her identity was revealed in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

## Entry #3

#### Claire

The dream sequence where Rand sees Moridin, and he thinks about having been there "long ago"—is he simply remembering his dreams there with Ishamael from
*The Eye of the World*
and
*The Great Hunt*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal Rigney

Yes.

## Entry #4

#### Question

(something regarding the bruises remaining on Min's neck, and if this was a typo)

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that is correct. Rand caused the bruises, so balefiring Semirhage would not make them go away. Balefire only removes paradoxes caused by the direct actions of the one who is balefired. And the bracelets remained after Rand balefired [Semirhage and Elza] because they weren't really part of Semirhage or Elza.

#### Claire

(comment regarding the thread on Dragonmount where some are arguing that by balefiring Graendal's palace, the Compulsion disappeared since there'd never had been a palace in the first place, and others are arguing that it doesn't work that way, objects don't have threads).

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Everything has a thread, not just souls. Even a stone in a wall has a thread in the Pattern.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Do the Seanchan know how to make
*cuendillar*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're trying to figure out if the collar Semirhage put on Rand is
*cuendillar*
. (this was a long convo so I can't remember all of it... I THINK he said the original had been made of
*cuendillar*
, and that the Seanchan had copies of it, but would not answer whether those were made of
*cuendillar*
as well. He wouldn't say if Rand was wearing a copy or the original, he said it didn't matter. And that he knew of at least two ways to destroy
*cuendillar*
—The True Power and
[one other way](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#10)
. He looked thoughtful when Muirenn mentioned the theory that women make white
*cuendillar*
and men make black
*cuendillar*
, but wouldn't confirm or deny.)
