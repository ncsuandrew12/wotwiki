## Entry #1

#### ValMar

OK, here's a quick recap of the signing in London. As usual many people came, Brandon was very nice and talkative and the thing lasted much longer than planned. There was a guy in front of me and the woman who was with him and I thought was his girlfriend or just a friendâ€”she was his mum!

Anyway, the questions:

## Entry #2

#### Question

Has Brandon (and Team Jordan I think) done any research on the battles/armies etc.?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, a lot. Brandon didn't want to give me specific examples to avoid spoilers for those who can guess. They contacted one very well known author who helped them with this research. Anyone can guess? I'll give one easy clue: Boromir.

## Entry #4

#### Question

Anything final on the prequels/sequels? This was answered to a guy right before me (with the unlikely mum:)).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really. Brandon doesn't want there to be any of these, but if written he wants to be the one who writes them. Instead, he is suggesting they do a movie on Tam.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Has Min's viewing of Gawyn either kneeling to or killing Egwene (from
*The Shadow Rising*
47) come to pass?

Yes.

## Entry #6

#### Question

How many Forsaken are left?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He thought a bit and said that there are no surprises there. He grinned in recognition of being a trick question.

## Entry #7

#### Question

The discussion about Rand and Lews Therin in his head has been framed as either a) Lews Therin is a construct created by Rand; b) Lews Therin is a real, separate person taking residence in Rand's head. Is the answer really limited to one of those two alternatives?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, since there will be plenty of Rand's points of view in
*A Memory of Light*
.

## Entry #8

#### Question

Is Nakomi Jenn Aiel? Was Aviendha transported through a Portal Stone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More careful thinking from Brandon. Then he said that Wetlander is a wise woman and is sniffing under the right tree. Interesting.

#### Footnote

Brandon later
[strongly implied](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=725#15)
there was no Portal Stone involved.

Apologies if I have forgotten to ask someone's question.
