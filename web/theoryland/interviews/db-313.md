## Entry #1

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Dear all,

Over a hundred people e-mailed condolences to the undertaker in Charleston. There is no way to respond on that site, and I just can't do individual responses. I hope that those who wrote there also read the blogâ€”thank you all for your very kind messages. I've read them all, and so has Will, and I've sent them on to Reynolds and Wilson.

The word now is ONWARD.

With love, Harriet
