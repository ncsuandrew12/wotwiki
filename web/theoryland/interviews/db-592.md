## Entry #1

#### Terez

So, Brandon went to
[this con](http://www.condfw.org/)
in Dallas, and some nice people from the tor.com re-read asked Brandon a few questions. For some reason the report is hidden on a secret Facebook page but they were kind enough to invite me. Thanks to James E. Jones for harassing Brandon.

## Entry #2

#### Fiddler

How would you compare Murandy's forces to those of Tear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Paraphrase) If Murandy had any significant forces, would they have needed to hire the Band?

## Entry #3

#### Tektonica

Does Moridin know that Rand drew the True Power through their connection?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Paraphrase) It's always best to assume that Moridin knows a lot more than he's revealed.

## Entry #4

#### Terez

There were also some RAFOs for other questions, but I'm not sure which. Nothing exciting, though (I looked through all their questions, but I dunno if he asked all of them). I'm going to footnote the Murandy quote with some pretty predictable arguments.
