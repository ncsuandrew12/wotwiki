## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

Long version: If you were following me on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Mistborn)
early last year, you saw me mention a large number of readers whose names I was adapting to appear in
*Towers of Midnight*
. The most common question I got in response was, "How do I get my name on that list?!" My response was that you had to have contributed to a fundraiser that
[TarValon.net](http://www.tarvalon.net/)
ran back before
*The Gathering Storm*
came out. But I let people know there would be another chance to get your name into the final book in the series,
*A Memory of Light*
.

Each Wheel of Time book has around two hundred new character and place names. When I was writing
*The Gathering Storm*
I tried inventing names the way I usually do, and I found that some of them didn't blend so well. So I decided to move to the method Robert Jordan used: He picked many names by altering ones that appear in our world today. This fits with the way he constructed the world of the Wheel of Time, as that world is both our world's distant future and distant past, and our legends are based on events from that world and that world's legends are based on events from our world. Picking names that way for
*Towers of Midnight*
resulted in ones that blended in better, with the happy bonus that a lot of fans who had contributed to the fundraiser but not won the contest for the three individual name winners at the time were still able to have their name appear in the book as a minor character (or location).

Auctioning off naming rights was something I started doing even before I had the opportunity to work on the Wheel of Time. I spoke some about this in
[my original post on the subject](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/750/Do-You-Want-to-Appear-in-A-Memory-of-Light)
back in 2009. Well, in April this year, we did another auction to appear in the next
[Stormlight Archive book](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/978/Appear-in-the-Sequel-to-THE-WAY-OF-KINGS)
. That auction benefitted a local Utah not-for-profit corporation for educational, literary, artistic and charitable purposes, with primary interest in science fiction and fantasy. They in turn donated the funds to BYU's volunteer-run science fiction and fantasy symposium,
[Life, the Universe, and Everything](http://ltue.org/LTUE_2012.html)
. The symposium was a great help to me back when I was an aspiring writer, and supporting something like that is a cause I can get behind completely.

So we're doing something similar this year for names in
*A Memory of Light*
. The process is being run by
[JordanCon](http://www.jordancon.org/)
, the not-for-profit fantasy literature convention that was founded in honor of Robert Jordan. I've been to three JordanCons now, and it is a great convention. Proceeds from this fundraiser will benefit both JordanCon and the Mayo Clinic.

For the details, I'm just going to quote their
[news release](http://www.jordancon.org/content/memory-light-naming-rights-jordancon-and-mayo-clinic)

JordanCon features four tracks of simultaneous programming, a Dealers Hall, and charity events benefiting the Mayo Clinic. Past guests have included Harriet McDougal, Brandon Sanderson, David Wong, Jana G. Oliver, David B. Coe and Eugie Foster.

> For more than 100 years, Mayo Clinic has inspired hope and contributed to health and well-being by providing the best care to every patient through integrated clinical practice, education and research. Today, your generosity is at the heart of sustaining Mayo's mission.
>
> As a not-for-profit organization, Mayo Clinic reinvests all earnings into improving patient care. Yet philanthropy provides essential support as we develop better methods to understand, predict, prevent, diagnose and treat disease, and train the next generation of physicians and scientists.
>
> Mayo Clinic has more than 3,300 physicians, scientists and researchers from every medical specialty. They work together with 46,000 allied health employees to care for more than half a million patients each year, from every U.S. state and many countries.
>
> In 2006, Robert Jordan was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis, which is a rare blood disease where abnormal proteins form in the bone marrow and become deposited in the patient's heart. During his illness Robert Jordan received treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and encouraged his fans to donate in support of the clinic. JordanCon is proud to continue to honor that request each year through various charitable fundraisers at the convention.
