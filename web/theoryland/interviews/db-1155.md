## Entry #1

#### Question

So for Calamity, like about these others that you mentioned, are we ever going to figure that out? Or--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah, so the next series I’m doing deals with the greater-- sort of interdimensional travel and who are these people.

#### Question

Okay good, because I was like “You can’t leave me like this” at the very end. I really like how it was put together and stuff. My own theories were that David was, his powers were figuring out Epics’ weaknesses—

#### Brandon Sanderson

I considered that, I really did. At the end of the day, when I brainstormed the trilogy I said you know what would be most fun for me in this series is to do a trilogy that is basically an origin story for a character and then when I come back to The Reckoners, if I do, because the next one’s a parallel dimension, right?

#### Question

From where Firefight is? Or another--

#### Brandon Sanderson

That-- We will get into why certain ones are stable and certain ones aren’t and why Megan can pull from and we’ll do something there with a new character. And if I come back, then Mizzy will be the main character in the sequel series.

#### Question

Awesome, […] looking forward to more Mizzy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Does that make sense? That’s where the plan for this is, we’ll see how the new series goes, they’re announcing it next week. And the entirety of the magic system is based on interdimensional stuff.

#### Question

Right, especially with Megan and her--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep.

#### Question

--multiple hundred personalities coming together and stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So it’s kind of like Megan has opened up this idea of a quantum multiverse, and now I’m going to do a quantum multiverse which is not something I can deal with in the cosmere so it’s exciting for me to be able to do it.

#### Question

Yeah ‘cause the first one we see about the others I was like […] this is not the cosmere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not cosmere. Going straight-up quantum multiverse, in kind of a classical sense. I’ve been doing a lot of reading on string theory and things. It’s so hard, string theory breaks my brain. Quantum mechanics break my brain, but they’re fun.

#### Question

A question about writing, how do you write a story set in a misogynistic setting, without writing a misogynistic story.

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Question

Is there a correlation between Awakening steel (Questioner later clarifies that by this he means making Nightblood), and summoning a sprenblade (Brandon tries to get him to clarify, live or dead sprenblade, but I don’t think they ended up on exactly the same page).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone should REALLY verbatim this one… the difference here is in one, you’re pouring Investiture into a physical object, in the other, something closer to pure Investiture is entering our realm and taking on a physical shape. Similar but different things. There is a correlation, but (trails off)

#### Question

Question about feruchemy and allomancy… what does it take to match allomantic pewter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He imagines that baseline pewter doubles strength, flaring triples. He wouldn’t imagine someone burning pewter and lifting a car. Hasn’t thought about speed and healing. He’s admitting he hasn’t canonized these things.

#### Question

If you were gonna build a Cosmere Avengers, who would you have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He doesn’t wanna talk about this to pre-dispose people. He’d have answered if it weren’t being recorded. He’d want someone from every magic system. Would the name of the team be a spoiler? He says, “I haven’t thought about it.” Then he starts talking about the 17th Shard but stops because the guy thinks this is his answer to the question, it doesn’t seem like he really wanted to give that as the simple answer.
