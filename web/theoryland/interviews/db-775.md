## Entry #1

#### Piestrio

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I spoke to Brandon Sanderson at a recent signing he said the title [of
*Towers of Midnight*
] literally refers to a place in Seanchan but obviously has lots of metaphorical meaning. I also asked about the Black Tower; he said he had a sequence set in the Black Tower that he is hoping to use but he'll have to wait and see as the book gets more complete to see if 1) it'll fit the "tone and theme" and 2) it doesn't make the book prohibitively long. He's already said that
*Towers of Midnight*
will be longer than
*The Gathering Storm*
.
