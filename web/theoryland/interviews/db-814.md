## Entry #1

#### Tor.com

You've possibly/maybe/sort of heard that Brandon Sanderson read a portion of the first chapter from
*A Memory of Light*
during his 2012 San Diego Comic Con spotlight. (And if you didn't until now, well, good news!
[You can read it here.](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/07/read-an-excerpt-from-chapter-one-of-a-memory-of-light")
)

That's not the only thing that Brandon let slip, though. Below we've listed further highlights from his spotlight, including an update on The Wheel of Time and his plans for his next five book releases.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

About The Wheel of Time:

Brandon delivered a little preamble/update on the progress of the book before reading the portion of Chapter One. "We are on time. Well, okay, we're late but we're on time enough that we're going to hit the January 8th [release date]."

He went on to explain, "We know you were hoping we could push it up to a November release, but we need the extra time to make sure we get this right. [Unlike
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
] we don't get another chance at this. This is the last book."

Further, Brandon mentioned that he had been up until 5 AM revising the novel, but added that he kind of likes to do that impulsively anyhow.

About the Mistborn movie:

Brandon conveyed that six drafts of the movie script have been done and that the latest draft, which he really likes, focuses more on the relationship between Vin and her brother Reen as a counterpart to Vin's relationship with Kelsier. Brandon and the independent producers are still shopping the script around to movie studios, however.

About the upcoming video game
[*Mistborn: Birthright*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/mistborn-birthright-is-coming-in-2013)
:

He conveyed that he's still writing the script for
*Mistborn: Birthright*
(although, considering the production timeline of video games, you're never really done writing the script until the game is on the shelves). It will be a cross-platform action RPG in the style of
*Infamous*
and
*Demon Souls*
, although he doubts they'll be able to have as open-ended a world as is featured in
*Infamous*
. Brandon went on to reiterate that the game is set 250 years before the first Mistborn book and stars a character who is "part of the history of the world." You can

## Entry #5

#### Brandon Sanderson

On the origins of the Mistborn series and his writing process:

"I'm always searching for ideas that I can connect into a larger story. I feel that a book is more than just one idea. A good book is a collection of ideas, a good idea for each character, something that forms the core of their conflict. Some ideas come from the setting, or something that's going to drive the economy, something that's going to, for me, drive the magic [system]."

Brandon continued to explain his process by demonstrating how the Mistborn series came together. "I was watching the Harry Potter movies and I was thinking about The Lord of the Rings and while I like the idea of the hero's journey, I began thinking about how the dark lord in these stories gets the raw end of the deal. So I wanted to write a book where the dark lord wins. Although that's kind of a downer."

Brandon explained that he shelved that idea until he could figure out how to make a story where the villain wins not be so bleak. "It took me a little while to figure out what to with that idea. Then I was watching one of my favorite movies,
*Sneakers*
, and started thinking about how I hadn't seen an amazing heist story in fantasy ever. Little did I know Scott Lynch was going to release a great one only a year later!"

The two ideas combined, Brandon continued, "like atoms that combine to create a molecule that's something different." The magic system in Mistborn was the same way, according to the author. Allomancy and Feruchemy were magic that had been designed for different worlds but worked really well together with the story of Mistborn.

So Brandon set to work, filling out the gaps in the story by brainstorming along the way.

One audience member noted that Brandon has a pattern of having his characters working towards a goal only to have that goal turn out to be the incorrect one, which prompted the author to discuss how he thinks of plot twists. "To figure out a good plot twist you want the reader or viewer to be surprised that it happened and then, as it's happening, realize they should have seen it coming. You can't always pull that off but when you can they're really great and that's what I'm shooting for."

"I don't twist my plot just to twist it. My hope is that the more that is revealed, the more that you experience a hidden depth to the characters and their journeys. It's like life. Everyone you meet you make a snap judgment but then the more you get to know them the more depth they reveal. I want readers to experience that with my books. Part of why I like writing epic fantasies is because the story gives you the room to develop and explore that depth. Everything is about more than one thing."

## Entry #6

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon's book release plan for the next five years:

After
*A Memory of Light*
is finished, Brandon's next focus is finishing the next Stormlight Archive book "as soon as possible, hopefully by this time next year." The next book is already intricately plotted out, which is about the halfway point for Brandon, and the rest of the writing "could take as little as 6 to 8 months."

There are two books that Brandon finished before starting on the final Wheel of Time book but which won't come out until after
*A Memory of Light*
, as Brandon wanted to properly support their release, which just isn't possible while finishing The Wheel of Time.

The first is
*The Rithmatist*
, a middle grade coming out from Tor Books next year about Joel, a non-magic kid enrolled in a magic school (his mom's the cleaning lady there) who starts investigating a murder that happens at the school. The magic system is "chalkboard magic," which Brandon likened to playing
*Starcraft*
. The kids draw a chalk circle around themselves on the floor then scribble in things that try and chew through the other kids' own chalk circles. Fans of his Alcatraz series will find the same appeal from
*The Rithmatist*
, according to the author.

Next is
*Steelheart*
, a post-apocalyptic superhero book where people in our world can only obtain super powers if they're evil. The inspiration for the story occurred to Brandon when he got cut off by another driver one day. "I thought, if I was a supervillain this guy would just be...BOOM." Which got him thinking about a world where people could actually do that.

In the world of
*Steelheart*
, these people are considered "forces of nature" and eventually the most powerful form little fiefdoms. The protagonist is an 18 year old boy whose father was killed by
*Steelheart*
, one of the most powerful superpowered villains, who joins an assassination guild in hopes of taking Steelheart down.

After Stormlight 2, Brandon will probably go straight into the third Stormlight book, although he might take a short break and write the follow-up to
*The Alloy of Law*
. And after that? Brandon really wants to write a follow-up to
*Elantris*
, as 2015 marks the ten-year anniversary of the publication of the first book.

## Entry #7

#### Question

Which authors does Brandon currently love to read?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I read a lot of Terry Pratchett. He's a legitimate genius and the books are different enough that I don't have to worry about any unconscious influence on my own writing. Guy Gavriel Kay is the best writer of fantasy today. I frequently read Robin Hobb novels. I love Vernor Vinge."

## Entry #8

#### Question

When asked if all his books occur in one universe:

#### Brandon Sanderson

While he was selling his initial works to publishers, Brandon was encouraged to write books set in different worlds as opposed to huge epic fantasy series. That way if a publisher didn't like one book he could pitch them a different one, which you can't do with a huge fantasy series. But as a way of still having a huge fantasy series, Brandon made all of these independent stories a "hidden epic." That is, he seeded continuing characters and elements into all of these different worlds, now dubbed the "cosmere".

*Elantris*
, the first book he sold, was one of the novels embedded with these elements so Brandon just kept putting them in subsequent novels. So far there is one character who appears in all of the worlds that he has created (i.e. not The Wheel of Time), sometimes by his name, Hoid, and sometimes only by appearance. He is connected to the grander story going on involving this cosmere.

Right now Brandon wants this to remain a fun easter egg so no one feels obligated to read his books in the order they were published. He will eventually tell the story of the cosmere, though, and you will be able to see what this character is doing.
