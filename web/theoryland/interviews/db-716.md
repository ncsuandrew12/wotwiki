## Entry #2

#### [JD (4 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/johnjosephTX/status/154787761629573120)

I played on older computer GSM the other day and came across The Green Man exactly as described by Jordan. Licensed?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154790995274379265)

Probably not, more RJ was drawing on
[mythology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man)
for the Green Man so they did as well.

#### [Shaun Duquette (18 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/159699862991020033)

Ok,when can we expect excerpts from
*A Memory of Light*
? And are you going to start another
*Way of Kings*
book after
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (18 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159835573920604160)

I expect summer to the first, and yes to the second.

#### [Sara Khan (19 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/sy_khan/status/160117479606202368)

Is there a possibility of the publication of RJ's notes or some sort of comprehensive, detailed guide for WoT after
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (19 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160184430663708673)

Harriet is doing an encyclopedia which should be awesome. Very comprehensive.

#### [Tomas Bergström (23 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/tomp115/status/161534891123679234)

I have paperbacks of WoT, but I'm thinking of getting the hardcovers. Will there be a separate box set hardcover edition coming after
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161733815184793601)

I am pushing for one. I think a nice trade paperback set is more likely.

## Entry #6

#### [Andrew Harrington (23 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/angrysauces/status/161510608271974403)

How do the
*a'dam*
circumvent the Aes Sedai oaths to force them to channel against non-Shadow, i.e. Whitecloaks?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161733968159444992)

I don't think the
*a'dam*
can. However, if the Aes Sedai believes that the person is a Darkfriend, they can channel against them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161734074912870401)

So conditioning their mind right, can do it. (The oaths have a provision for Darkfriends, though some editions
[left this out](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=489#1)
.)

#### [Brian Condon (25 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/Bryzie101/status/162033817689931776)

Just wondering if there will be any sort of way RJ's ending will stand out, or if it just flows with your work.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094240074178561)

I think those who know our different writing styles will be able to pick out the differences.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094310114861056)

It depends on how closely one watches the prose.

## Entry #8

#### [Felix (24 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/162014284371603457)

For a normally verbal and talkative individual at book signings, @BrandSanderson goes silent about Valan Luca.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094473042608128)

Ha. Well, honestly, I don't want to answer too many questions about things like this.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094576927117312)

For some of them, it would require me to deviate from the work I need to do by reading deeply in the notes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094645730480129)

For others, I think RJ himself would have stayed quiet, so I stay quiet myself.

#### [Austin Moore (15 February 2012)](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/169849637065326594)

Do you think it's possible for an university to teach a WoT-style class?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 February 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169989991823454208)

Meaning a class about the WoT? I think that has happened already.

#### Brandon Sanderson (recovered Tweet)

By the way, as many have noted, it appears that RJ, myself, and Wheel of Time were involved in a Jeopardy! clue yesterday.

Does Uno makes a return in
*A Memory of Light*
? Haven't seen him in a while. Or has his character finished his tasks related to the story?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 February 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/172789752800620544)

Uno will appear.

Hey, Do you know where I can get a
*Towers of Midnight*
dust jacket? I ordered the book used and it didn't come with one. :(

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182008067867672577)

I can probably mail you one if you drop me an email. I've got a few extra.

## Entry #12

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 March 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183110898867638272)

All right. Kelsier and Moiraine are facing each other in the Suvudu cage match next round. Guess I should do a write up.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183111066673360896)

I think I'll just flip a coin to decide who wins, then write something that makes it seem logical.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183116423416123392)

Though this is (for a Suvudu Cage Match) actually quite even, I'm going to have to play it very tongue-in-cheek. Just a warning.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183116568891363328)

Don't expect an epic battle. I don't have the time to spare to write up something like that in this case.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183120294356070400)

Okay, that's done. Quick and dirty, I'm afraid, but it's all the time I could spare. Should be up on Suvudu soon, maybe on my website also.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183120542767906816)

Warning: it not only contains huge spoilers for both series, but a lot of WoT and Mistborn in jokes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183121662873571329)

If you disagree with the results of my coin flip, feel free to vote however you wish in the cage match poll. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183277969270255616)

Write up I did for Kelsier and Moiraine will go up Monday, I believe. I'll post a link when it goes live.

#### [AIDAN MOHER](https://twitter.com/adribbleofink/status/183285555017166848)

You stole my cage match, Brandon! ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183303332956340224)

Ha! You were the one who would tackle this, eh?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183303410626473985)

Well, if you had something cool you wanted to do, I'll post it on my site if you still want to write it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (26 MARCH)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184370473977655297)

In case you haven't seen it, my Moiraine vs Kelsier write up is
[here](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/03/cage-match-2012-round-4-moiraine-damodred-versus-kelsier.html)
.

#### [BARRY ARNOLD](https://twitter.com/barry_arnold/status/184371141484355585)

I liked it, it was a fun read, still voted for Moiraine though :P ^\_^

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184371447630807040)

I actually tried to leave it ambiguous at the end. The thing people should be asking themselves is this:

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184371564110811136)

"As the write-up was from Kelseir's viewpoint, can we assume that the whole thing happened as Moiraine wanted it to?"

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184371772047626241)

You need to ask yourself that whenever you end a conversation with an Aes Sedai. :)

Hi Brandon—huge fan and BYU alumni. Going to reread WoT; only made it through book 9 originally. Any recommendations?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 March 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183303764822859776)

I found that knowing an ending was done and out there made some of the slower books far more enjoyable.

I know you see my tweets. Show some respect toward Mr. Jordan and release his notes on the completion of the series. #shady

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 April 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/191699665748635648)

I'm sorry. I often miss tweets. I haven't seen any of your others. I would be happy to release the notes if Harriet allows it.

#### [BISHOP MEKAY](https://twitter.com/TheGoodTroll/status/191701969017126912)

Thank you. It would bring joy to my heart to feel his words on the ending of the greatest story told. No disrespect intended.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/191703461778300928)

I understand. I plan to push Harriet on this more once the last book is out.

OMG Taim's palace is made of Shayol Ghul rock! According to a report on @BrandSanderson in Australia. (That was my question. :p)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 April 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/193589883216990208)

I spent a long time trying to figure out if you had secret motives for asking that.

#### Footnote

It's actually the walls and the podium that are made out of Shayol Ghul rock. See

Do you see the speed your books get published at changing with the end of WoT? Seeing as how editing WoT takes so much longer?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 May 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204698782519144448)

Yes, I do. Getting WoT right takes about double the time it takes to do my own works, so we shouldn't have any more no-book years.

I heard Robert Jordan planned three prequels to WoT—one was
*New Spring*
—are there plans still for the other two?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/221775212830670849)

#### [Terez (8 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/222170356931235841)

According to Taim, he has 1920 Asha'man manning the walls and he'd need at least two times that many for rotation. Is that a mistake? [8 miles of wall (9.P), two Asha'man at each guard post, spaced at fifty-foot intervals (13.53). 6000 feet to a
[WoT mile](https://sites.google.com/site/hcfflibrary/glossary#length)
.]

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/222172255126437888)

Wow. Yeah, that totally looks like a mistake. I'll look it up, but...yeah, probably a mistake.

#### [Daniel Shepherd (13 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/223680771167227904)

@Terez27 Trying to figure out who the gay character was that @BrandSanderson put in
*Towers of Midnight*
. Was it Androl?

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/223681755641692160)

That is my best guess. I wonder if we scared him away from going through with that...'twas very controversial.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223682091911614464)

The place wasn't right in
*Towers of Midnight*
. Gay character is in
*A Memory of Light*
. It's really not a big deal; just a small mention.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223682562910994432)

I will say, at this point, that it is a character RJ mentioned was gay in the notes, so I noted it in the text.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/223690458310787072)

[Links to following tweet from

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 March 2011)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49664901110710272)

I won't say if it's a new character or one I made a decision on, since there weren't notes either way.

#### [Terez (13 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/223691141336403968)

I'm guessing that's a product of Twitter being a bad place for trying to say things clearly. The older tweet was confusing anyway.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223712573911085057)

Wow, that was indeed confusing. I don't even know what I was trying to say.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223712712297947138)

What I remember typing was "I won't tell you if it's something RJ had in notes or not."

at Dragon\*Con. My complete schedule is
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1108/My-DragonCon-Schedule)
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 September)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/242351684276330496)

Tor dot com has
[posted](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/09/a-memory-of-light-chapter-11-excerpt)
the excerpt from
*A Memory of Light*
that I'm reading today.

#### [W.S.E. (3 September)](https://twitter.com/SunDriedRainbow/status/242805701716627456)

A little disgusted that you included a throwaway line about Tylin raping Mat. Still buying the book though. Probably twice.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/242822725071147008)

Hard to ignore that it happened, returning to the city as he was.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/242771349603512320)

... you re-awakened the Mat/Tylin sexual assault vs. super funny joke fury. Ahh the indignant fandom. \*sighs\*

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/242825161475227648)

\*sighs in agreement\*

#### [W.S.E.](https://twitter.com/SunDriedRainbow/status/242823337263386624)

I feel the same way about all the characters saying "you go Tylin" in
*A Crown of Swords*
, too.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/242827497241206784)

It is one of the WoT's most controversial sequences, to be sure.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 September)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/243114851046682628)

The three excerpts of
*A Memory of Light*
that have been released so far:
<http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/04/a-memory-of-light-prologue-excerpt>
<http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/07/read-an-excerpt-from-chapter-one-of-a-memory-of-light>
<http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/09/a-memory-of-light-chapter-11-excerpt>

#### Footnote

RJ apparently
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#2)
that it was supposed to be seen as rape, and that it was also supposed to be funny. Some fans took the humorous treatment of the subject very badly (because rape is, after all, quite serious), but RJ was likely trying to draw attention to the double standard.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 September 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246284437988442112)

The prologue ebook for
*A Memory of Light*
, "By Grace and Banners Fallen," is up for preorder on Dragonmount. Other vendors to follow.

#### [Austin Moore](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/246321131198488576)

After prologue is released on October 2nd, will you be able to say which part of it was all RJ?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246333806204837889)

Yes.

#### [Sam Tills](https://twitter.com/SamTills/status/246289192877953024)

Will this be part of the whole book when it comes out, or will it only be sold separately?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246334079115595776)

Tor and Harriet like to sell the prologue early as a separate ebook. It will be the same one in the final book.

#### [Brian LeP](https://twitter.com/BLePinTO/status/246285124705067008)

I know that this isn't your idea, but selling the prologue is a brutal cash grab. I'll save my $3 and wait for the book.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246334357013417984)

I have made it clear both to fans and Tor that I do not like this process. But you are right, I do not get to choose.

#### [Jasmin](https://twitter.com/buitenj/status/246362422066171904)

No normal book??? Only an ebook??

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246365298184314880)

Tor releases the prologue of each WoT early as a for-sale ebook. It is the same one that will be in the print edition in January.

#### Footnote

On September 17, the prologue showed up for sale on Google Books in Canada, including some revealing previews that tempted fans (aside from the Canadians who were able to buy it) to piece together the prologue from Google Book searches. Predictably, chaos ensued.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom (17 September)](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/247802172652285952)

I blame Canada.

#### [sleepinghour](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/247808787925303296)

Last time it was some guy in China with an early
*Towers of Midnight*
copy. But Canada was the dark horse nobody saw coming. #amolgate

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/247804948983738368)

I hope moving up release date is a possibility, elsewise a little black market will emerge very soon...

#### Footnote

I should disclose that I was essentially the ringleader of the put-the-prologue-together team, but I wasn't trying to make a threat here. It wasn't even my idea, and if I hadn't organized it, someone else would have; that's just how things go in the WoT world. But I was really referring to the possibility that some of the Canadians would share the whole prologue, or even sell it.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/247884605728894978)

I'm going to pretend like Brandon did this on purpose. #wotgh

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/247813492567064576)

Now I just blame Google. What a cluster\*\*\*\*.

#### [sleepinghour (September 18)](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/248005558622380032)

What's sad about the prologue leak is that Harriet and others in publishing will likely see this as proof ebook releases should be delayed.

#### [Mike Beckwith](https://twitter.com/RogueInsight/status/248174751212765184)

Wow. I know I'd be pretty pissed. Wonder how Sanderson feels about it. @BrandSanderson Spoiler thoughts?

#### [sleepinghour](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/248161089865535488)

Google's stopped the sale now, but some people already have copies and shared spoilers. So Harriet & Co. probably aren't happy.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248199965321601024)

I'm not fond of spoilers, but I can't see the original comment, so I don't know the specifics of this discussion.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248253641339846656)

This sort of thing happens. I don't really mind, personally. Harriet is probably upset, however.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248248663032356864)

If you're the type who wants the $2.99
*A Memory of Light*
prologue ebook, it will be available September 19th instead of October 2nd.

#### [Brandon Stetter](https://twitter.com/BrandonStetter/status/248261702381080577)

Is that correct? The ebook will be available tomorrow instead of October 2nd? Pre-order or not?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248263233075544064)

I believe so.

#### [Austin Moore (September 19)](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/248274281270747136)

Was the RJ part of the prologue the Bayrd scene?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248279531671150594)

No, actually. It was the Isam part, though I filled in a hole in the middle of the scene.

#### [Tor Nordam](https://twitter.com/tornordam/status/248280320653291520)

Looking forward to it. But do you know when it'll be available in Europe?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248282111558160385)

I don't know, I'm afraid. That is up to the UK publisher, and I don't think ebooks are as big a concern to them as they are here.

#### [Étienne Bausson](https://twitter.com/ebausson/status/248306970141028352)

Where can European people get it from? Dragonmount won't sell it to me. Do I have to go for a torrent?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248310459323789313)

The problem is that Tor doesn't have rights to sell it in Europe. It's a frustrating system, but Orion UK has the European rights.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248310967153328128)

The system made more sense back before ebooks; a European company needed assurance US publishers wouldn't flood their markets.

#### [Étienne Bausson](https://twitter.com/ebausson/status/248313974314106880)

I will check Orion UK once at work. Thanks for the tip!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248315079404163072)

Warning: they might have been planning to release it in October. This whole "Release it two weeks early" thing surprised us.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248315441657827328)

It's because of leaked copies in Canada. (Also, it's Orbit in UK—not Orion. I get them mixed up.)

#### [Aulis Vaara (20 September)](https://twitter.com/AulisVaara/status/248781225664323585)

What is your opinion on the North American exclusivity of the
*A Memory Of Light*
prologue?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248872507455721472)

It's because Tor doesn't have rights to sell anywhere else; Orbit UK has those rights. If you want the book, ask them.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248872714419449856)

I wish Orbit had it out too, and I'm seeing what I can do. But it is their call.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248906447168106499)

Tor has a
[post](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/qby-grace-and-banners-fallenq-now-available-in-select-non-us-markets)
indicating that the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue ebook is now for sale in select countries outside the U.S.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248906663317352448)

Note that this doesn't include countries where Orbit UK has rights to the books. To buy it there, you'll need to ask them to release it.

#### [Danny Hooper](https://twitter.com/themanofdann/status/248907129367437313)

Who do we contact to ask them to release it? Is there an email address we can write to?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248908561713860608)

They have a
[form](http://www.orbitbooks.net/contact-us/)
on their website. That might work.

#### [Michael](https://twitter.com/micky_magpie/status/248926267137736704)

Where can Australian fans get a copy of the WOT release?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249002562487992320)

Orbit UK owns the rights. They'd have to either release it or authorize Dragonmount. You can email them through their website.

#### [Lane Thompson](https://twitter.com/lanestp/status/248921587447894016)

Is the prologue going to come out in audio or do I need to pick it up the written down on magic pixel paper version?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249002666318000128)

No audio I'm aware of. (Until the full book is out, of course.)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249002801152262145)

Oh, just saw that there was one. Never mind.

#### [Marc Taylor](https://twitter.com/shellimark/status/249249578283581440)

Any idea as to when will Weller @WellerBookWorks starts taking autograph orders for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249249713969299456)

Not sure.

#### [Daniel Shepard (21 September)](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/249295449331212290)

By grace and banners fallen. Was that your line or RJ's? Exquisitely eloquent if I say so myself.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249301568657178624)

How bad is this? I honestly can't remember. It's one of my favorite lines, but I don't know if it was in the notes or not.

#### [Jonny Nilsson](https://twitter.com/dreamedge84/status/250366561972539392)

Will it be possible to order
*A Memory of Light*
signed, like the previous two books?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/250368416769273856)

Yes, it should be.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (24 September)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/250333947958026240)

Jason of Dragonmount writes the world's first
[review](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/dear-robert-jordan)

#### [Julian Stevenson (20 September 2012)](https://twitter.com/FunnyMan1974/status/248824747960442881)

You may have already answered this. Are you going to write the WOT prequels? Is anyone going to write them?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 September 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248872229025222656)

It's not likely. We feel that RJ's legacy is better protected by doing fewer books.

#### [Nelson Ambrose](https://twitter.com/DragonRedux/status/248819670872899585)

Would Harriet publishing RJs notes regarding the prequels and outriggers in the encyclopedia she's going to write?

It's possible. You could always ask her if she will. I'll have very little to do with the process.

## Entry #25

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 October 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/254390215106502656)

I've been getting questions about "Unfettered," an anthology next year with a Wheel of Time story in it. Blog post next week, but...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/254390937554403330)

The "story" is actually a deleted sequence from
*A Memory of Light*
we cut for pacing reasons. We donated it to Shawn to help pay his medical bills.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/254391429089071104)

As I said, I will blog this soon. It is from the viewpoint of someone you know, but not one of the main characters.

#### [Jonathan B.](https://twitter.com/ka243/status/255266370638446592)

Could you let us know where the "story" would have gone in the book once its released so we can read it in order?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/255409491535859712)

Sure.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/256098486850838528)

A deleted sequence from
*A Memory of Light*
called "River of Souls" will appear in the anthology
*Unfettered*
(early 2013).

The
*A Memory of Light*
tour will have a gap in the middle since baby #3 is due in January. Dates and locations will be announced soon. Sit tight.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/258253184622018561)

I can confirm now that the midnight release event for
*A Memory of Light*
will be held in Provo at the BYU Bookstore.

## Entry #28

#### [Herid (27 October 2012)](https://twitter.com/heridfan/status/262202188921700354)

Dragonmount is now a complete @BrandSanderson bashing ground. This is becoming unbearable. What happened? Was not so last year.

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/262265339138682880)

It's unfortunate, but natural. I've grown popular enough that some people say my wot books are better than RJ's, which isn't true.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/262266502772834304)

The hardcore fans then feel the need to point out the flaws in my efforts, and many things they say are true.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/262266868688105473)

I do wish some were not as vicious as they are, however.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155015848448001)

So, apparently @BrandSanderson has chosen to believe that the criticism levelled at him is just a jealous reaction.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155203732291584)

A response by hardcore fans loyal to Jordan to the suggestion that @BrandSanderson's work on the Wheel is better than RJ.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155547199643648)

In @BrandSanderson's defence, he does offer that the hardcore fans use some truth in their jealous rage.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155809679183872)

So I suppose at least @BrandSanderson offers efficacy to our criticism, if not legitimacy.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263163906162323457)

I'm curious as to where you gain your insights into the criticism? After all you could not even bring yourself to read a...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164321616498688)

...critique wrapped in kiddy gloves that you yourself requested. Are you sure this isn't some sort of self-rationalisation?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164441980456960)

After all, a small select group blowing minor (but admittedly real) flaws out of proportion in a misguided attempt...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164660386234369)

... at loyalty to Jordan is a much easier thing to swallow than the idea that the criticism might have truth...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164834764435456)

... in both the specifics and in the degree of its existence.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263165163610468352)

Anyway, I'm done raging at you now. Wow. That was weird. Must have seen someone suggest you were better than Jordan.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263346802944786433)

Luckers, I worry sometimes about how strongly you react to things like this. I didn't call the criticisms minor or misguided.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263347327589306368)

I agreed they are true. I am flawed. I cannot yet write well as you want me to. I'm sorry you find that personally offensive.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263347771686416384)

I do not think that is the only reason people criticize me. Twitter makes it hard to explain things in depth.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263348449506889728)

I have seen it being a factor—explicitly, by the poster's own words—in criticism. I find that noble. I didn't want to offend.

## Entry #29

#### [Jan Carrick (30 October 2012)](https://twitter.com/Boethius32/status/263261007714078721)

Will we see more of the serious, dark Mat that we left in
*Knife of Dreams*
? That is, the one Tuon refers to as...

#### [Jan Carrick](https://twitter.com/Boethius32/status/263261829663440896)

... "a lion on the high plains" and who leaves wounded enemy combatants to suffer and die (
*Knife of Dreams*
ch. 27)? Thanks for your time.

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263352147574394880)

I've tried. I do worry that sometimes I'm too lighthearted with Mat, and need to remember his dangerous side too.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263352216507789313)

I have attempted to walk this balance in

## Entry #30

#### [Tor Nordam (30 October 2012)](https://twitter.com/tornordam/status/263208736674426880)

RJ
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#20)
in a Q&A that 62.5% of women strong enough to be Aes Sedai, yet only 20% of 1000 novices are strong enough. How so?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 October 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263352403254992896)

That sounds like a question for Maria, I'm afraid. I don't have the notes handy to look into the discrepancy.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263353572706631680)

Email is probably best, or grabbing her at JordanCon. (Or sending the question with someone you know who is attending.)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263364759909457920)

Actually, the easiest way is probably to drop me an email through my website and let me forward it on to her.

Something I've always wondered. In the Age of Legends was Lews Therin aware he was the Champion of Light (with previous memories of past lives)?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/265589319975174144)

He did not, so far as I know, have memories of past lives.

#### [Herid (19 December 2012)](https://twitter.com/heridfan/status/281519964932935681)

Memory 24 is such a boring teaser and on @BrandSanderson's birthday too. This is not right! @tordotcom should give us a bonus memory.

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/281534155702030338)

Ha. Okay, Teaser: "River of Souls" was a direct result of me trying to do be better at something RJ did well & I did poorly.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/281534421578960897)

Problem is, I overdid it, and the story veered far too "Brandon-ish" as a result, which was why we cut it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/281534628739825664)

Fortunately, by having done "River of Souls", the added depth behind-the-scenes helped fix the very issue I was worried about.

## Entry #34

#### Terez

This conversation is actually from 2013, but after soliciting opinions on whether or not I should include it in the database at all, I decided to stick it at the very bottom of the 2012 page so that it's less likely anyone will be 'subjected to it' (as one fan put it) by surprise. There are not really any distinctive search terms in the conversation, and I haven't tagged it. I think it's worth documenting just because Brandon was pushed to say some things here that he might not have otherwise said, but be warned, many fans found it 'painful' to read.

#### [Luckers (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290108553576984577)

Was feeling damn Zen about
*A Memory of Light*
... then I read @BrandSanderson interviews. Seriously, what idiot wrapped him in swaddling? @PeterAhlstrom

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290116191274561537)

So, @BrandSanderson gave up on trying to read Jordan's notes after two months, instead relying on Maria and Alan. Sadly, this shows.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290117165410025474)

Comparatively he has been working on the Wheel for 60 months. Maybe a larger stint than 1.2% of his time might have been effective.

#### [Shawn Prosper](https://twitter.com/Daewolf/status/290115170750058496)

Gotta ask what you mean? I'm confused what you are referring to.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290119934841864192)

It's just the vast divergence between Brandon's perception of his work and the actual.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290121266969591808)

To be frank I am entirely cognizant of the difficulties @BrandSanderson faced. Working in a world not his own, with Harriet the final word.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290121523912650754)

That being said, so long as @BrandSanderson presumes to think he aced it, we have problems, and Mat is nothing but the tip of the iceberg.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290122160821903360)

Which brings us back to this—who wrapped @BrandSanderson in swaddling, and played with his toes? Who led him to believe he did well?

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290127138227634176)

Aced it is overstating. He knows many things didn't turn out perfectly. Nevertheless the conversations people are having...

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290127413738872832)

...about the book right now are the right conversations and that says a lot.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290108553576984577)

He still knows large portions of the book won't work for some readers. Zen is a better reaction than expected.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290108553576984577)

Yet I've never seen him express this. It's always you, if that. His comments are all about how content he is with his work.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290134288438005760)

And, for that matter, what are the 'right' conversations?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290135141936922624)

It's not that he disagrees, its that he appears oblivious, hence my question about who is wrapping him in swaddling.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290135774047924224)

IMO Brandon likes to put the best face on things—he knows the caveats are there but doesn't need to accompany every statement...

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290136089321164800)

...with the caveats. It also depends on the attitude of the person he's talking with. If he were talking to you he'd be more...

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290136223777968129)

...likely to talk about the other issues. This is all in my opinion.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290136921299095554)

...so how bout he talk to me? Directly? About this specifically.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290137125083553792)

JordanCon! :D

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138037441155073)

Damn you. Honest to Verin, I want nothing more right now than to join you in the grin.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138432464908288)

But the fact is the book is out, and I'll not be placated.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138642519834625)

Brandon is asserting how he hasn't broken the fourth wall despite that being the largest complaint against him.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138800833822720)

He thinks he's perfected Mat, despite the fact that at best the Betas carved the winks to the reader from the book.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290153748322451461)

To me breaking the fourth wall means the characters talk directly to the reader or talk about how they're fictional characters.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290153867642036225)

And in my view that never happens in the books.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290154090447634432)

Things that "take you out of the book" are a valid criticism but that's different from breaking the fourth wall.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/290154874191101952)

Semantics really. I think the proper term is fanservice. ;)

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290155626594725888)

I can accept that term. :D

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138937568149504)

Fact is, we're at the end of things, and Brandon has to answer for himself. And the more he talks, the more that is so.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290140000446738433)

And @PeterAhlstrom the most significant point about all this is that he seems oblivious of the criticism.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290141794396688384)

Give a look at the others @ing me sometime. Not everyone feels as you do. I certainly don't.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290142684612530178)

Dude, I am very aware of those who support you, you've done good work—great work, even.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290142967904215040)

But you hide behind them.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143260666626049)

And you always have. You can always find those who support you, just as you can always find those who disagree.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143455299133441)

It's how you respond that matters, and you have disdained those who disagree and raised up those who agree. Hence our problem.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290149434627596288)

Disdained? Where have I ever disdained you or anyone else? I have always accepted and tried to understand my critics.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290149710872866817)

I've listened. As I've told you, just because I decide I don't agree with your complaints doesn't mean I am ignoring you.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290149803835420672)

You are correct. Disdained is not the right word, but nor have you accepted or tried to understand your critics.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290150526614638593)

And you not agreeing is fine. I've told you that!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290142866787930112)

What's the point of tweeting me now? It is done. The book's out. I know your complaints. I don't agree. That is where we end.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143764931031040)

This is the fundamental element of our disagreement. For you this was just a job.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143938617159681)

You picked up something precious, because it was shiny, and played with it like it was a toy.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290144119697862656)

Now you think to throw it aside, and expect us to let it go, but here's the thing—battered and broken, it's still precious.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290150358230126592)

When have I EVER called this "Just a job?" I dare you to find where I refer to the WoT, as anything other than precious.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290150604012154880)

I picked up something that love, and I treated it with love. You continue to insist I am lying about this. Why?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151285355864064)

Because, to be frank, all that I have seen of this has been cavalier. And I mean at every point.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151493577887746)

I've seen that you enjoyed the Wheel. I saw when that stopped. I saw you withdraw, and I saw no change to the work product.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151823145332738)

And I was content. But when I see you comment about how you didn't break the fourth wall when that is the single most...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151953084850176)

...common complaint currently (and to be clear I am completely inactive on the boards at the moment)...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290152128750706688)

...and things like how you mastered Mat...this has nothing to do with me.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290145912091721729)

As for where we end... I've followed the Wheel since I was 12. Where precisely do you think I'll simply stop?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290151143521284096)

The "stop" referred to tweeting me. I expect you to continue to be involved.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290151343698628608)

But what is the point of continuing to tweet me with the same complaints after I have said "I understand but disagree?"

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290151516797546496)

And finally, as for referring to those who enjoyed the book, you ASKED me who said I did well. I answered your question.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290152477976829952)

Fair enough. Though I do still question which particular group led you to the sweeping statements of success you've made.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154154599530497)

You can find people and reviews who say I did a poor job. I can find reviews and people who say I did a great job.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290154330135347201)

Yes, this is true. Neither mean much.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154267543732225)

We will spin round and around on this topic, going nowhere. But at the end of the day...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154620322451456)

I KNOW I did a good job. Not perfect, but very good. I know it as an artist. To me, that's secondary only to Harriet's opinion.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154759363645440)

And she feels it turned out very well. She is the one I agreed to do this for, her and RJ. That's why I can say what I do.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290155668298690560)

Okay, firstly, I've seen you an Peter cast aspersions on Harriet's judgement. So what the fuck are you doing here? Hiding?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290156273356382208)

I mean, serious aspersions. You've cited her to me as the basis of many faults.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290156343816503297)

Now you cite her as proof you've done well. Fuck that, man.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154919468617729)

If criticisms mean an artist can't be proud of their work, then nobody would be allowed. You say I don't love the WOT.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155086250930178)

You're wrong. You don't know my heart or my passion. And I'm very, very happy with what I have done. As a fan and as an artist.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155276454211585)

This is why I say there is no further point. I accept what you say. Hopefully, I can use it to be better in the future.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155438857654273)

But I am tired of opening Twitter and finding you tweeting me, yet again, to make the same complaints.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290157354937376768)

They aren't coming in a vacuum. You speak on the Wheel and it will draw its reaction. This won't go away.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155608999616514)

Please. Let's shake hands and part. You will continue to criticize, as is your right.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155759516405760)

But from here, it has no relevance upon changing my approach to the WoT, for it is done. So let us end.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290158817478582273)

Irrespective you have to handle the fall out. You can acknowledge its radioactive or think it rain—doesn't stop it falling.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290159554677850112)

Final note—it's not about changing anything. I was never trying to 'save the Wheel'. It's worse, it's judgement.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290159817824280576)

...and it won't go away. It won't acknowledge that you're done and be done in turn. It will in fact do nothing but grow. Sorry.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290158091415191553)

This is where I make the 'I will wait for you on Toman Head' joke, but I dislike being Shazam!!

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290158333686587393)

Seriously though, you seem aggrieved that I don't simply let you walk. Are you out there talking about the Wheel every day?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290159320597921792)

Yes, James. I just don't want to talk to you about it any longer.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290159600613855232)

Today you have sworn at me, called me a child, implied I lie frequently, and told me I don't love something I do dearly.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290159835293548545)

You moved from criticism to harassment long ago, but I have tried to continue to find common ground.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290160183303348224)

Fair enough.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290160106153328642)

Even here, I want to respond to your allegations about me and Harriet—which are wrong—but you speak in such a harsh way.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290160447200587776)

I want to be done not because I don't like responding to criticism, but because I find interaction with you to be caustic.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290160658899677184)

And if I were to say that being caustic has been the only thing to draw a response from you?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290161078367838208)

...the only thing to draw a half way honest response, and even then not truly a response?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290162288734916610)

And so we end with you calling me a liar again. This is why, James.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290162960226197505)

Not a liar. You live in your own world. And when you speak, our truths clash.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290163231522172929)

Or I suppose you could reverse that. Irrespective, I'm not calling you a liar.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290162966387638272)

You don't get answers or responses because you don't ask questions. You make accusations.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290161886035591168)

I never set out to be caustic, and when I was I didn't say it to draw a response... but you hide.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290163253835882496)

The reason for silence is because it should be the artist's way. Listen to criticism. Do not defend against it.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290163610850844672)

And yet you aren't silent.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290163771786276866)

Let the work stand on its own. Nothing is accomplished by being defensive. I am very proud of what I have done. Goodbye.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290165611202498560)

And as all things fall, my one regret is that you do not know how highly I regard you. Sweetness is bitter, and that is all that may be done.
