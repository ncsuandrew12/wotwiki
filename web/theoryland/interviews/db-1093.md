## Entry #1

#### PhantomMonstrosity

Do synthetic gemstones work in fabrials too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Synthetic gemstones should work. It's a combination of color and chemical structure that's important. Just like metals from off Scadrial would work for an Allomancer, synthetic gemstones should work.

## Entry #2

#### PhantomMonstrosity

Let's say we had a platypus Feruchemist, who can sense electric fields. Could he make a tinmind for that sense?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Platypus tinmind should work.

## Entry #3

#### PhantomMonstrosity

Can a pewter Feruchemist go all fiddler crab? Store a bunch of strength from one arm, tap it into the other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So far, any Feruchemist we've seen has been required to enhance their entire body or make their entire body weaker.

## Entry #4

#### PhantomMonstrosity

If the Lord Ruler joined the Knights Radiant, what order would he fit in best?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lord Ruler might make an okay Skybreaker, but not a great one.

## Entry #5

#### PhantomMonstrosity

Let's say some mistborn jerk tosses Nightblood into the mists. What happens?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I suspect the mists would pull away from Nightblood, though he'd try to feed on them.
