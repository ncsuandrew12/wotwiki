## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

The book's release is getting closer, folks. Are you excited yet?

Dragonmount has announced the
[Tower Guard program](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/tom/the-tower-guard-program-r39)
for the upcoming book tour, similar to the Storm Leaders program from last year. Basically, this is an opportunity for a few hardcore fans in each city to spend some personal time with Harriet and me, in exchange for helping out at the signing. I had a great time with the Storm Leaders last year, and I look forward to it again this year. If you're interested in the opportunity,
[Dragonmount's application is right here](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/tom/the-tower-guard-program-r39)
.

I've also put up a page explaining how to get
[signed & numbered copies of
*Towers of Midnight*](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/page/62/Towers-of-Midnight-Release-Events)
. For those who can't attend a signing during the tour, pay close attention to the section on the
[Sam Weller's signing by mail](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/page/62/Towers-of-Midnight-Release-Events#item4)
. There's an important addition to that this time: For no additional shipping cost, you can buy another book to be delivered in the same box, such as a second copy of
*Towers of Midnight*
, or a copy of
*The Gathering Storm*
or
*The Way of Kings*
. (Only
*Towers of Midnight*
will be numbered, but I'll sign and personalize the other books too.)

On the same page, details on the numbering system for the midnight release are there too. If you went to the
*Way of Kings*
release it will work pretty much the same way, but there are a few changes from how it worked at last year's
*The Gathering Storm*
release. Plus they have some cool things planned for the release party.
