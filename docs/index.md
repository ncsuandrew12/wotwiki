# wotwiki

This repository is intended as a depository of everything related to the [*Wheel of Time* wiki](https://wot.wiki) that is better suited to being stored in git or displayed via Github Pages than it is to being hosted on the wiki itself.

If you want to contribute code or content, create a [branch](https://github.com/ncsuandrew12/wotwiki/branches) for it and open a [pull request](https://github.com/ncsuandrew12/wotwiki/pulls).

# Projects

## Theoryland Interview Database

We host [a copy](./theoryland/interviews) of the [Theoryland Interview Database](https://www.theoryland.com/listintv.php) which is better suited for simple text searches and machine processing than the original. The original is more convenient for simple searches and has a bit of a prettier look.

All copyrights and licenses for the interviews belong to Theoryland or their original authors. We are not affiliated with Theoryland in any way.
