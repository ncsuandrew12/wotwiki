#### Argent

In terms of timeline-- So The Way of Kings and the Stormlight Archive takes place 1173-4 right now, how far ago, approximately, was the Recreance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So you-- Let’s see-- Heralds leave at what, 4500?

#### Argent

That’s what it says.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So the Heralds leave at 4500 and we’re at 11--

#### Argent

So we are at 5500 years after--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So Recreance is more recent than late.

#### Argent

So… In the thousands--

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m going to have to pull out the timeline.

#### Argent

But it’s not like three hundred years ago.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s not like three hundred years ago, but it’s also not like 4000 years ago.

#### Argent

Okay, so from the middle--

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Hierocracy happened after and the Hierocracy was a couple hundred years ago. It’s longer than that even, it’s like five or six hundred years ago I think.
