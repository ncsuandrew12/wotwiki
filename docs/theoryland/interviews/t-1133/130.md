#### Kurkistan

So you've said that healing is like the spiritual wants to heal and then it filters through the Cognitive, but how's that work with healing wounds to the soul like Hemalurgy or Shardblades? What do you refer to to heal the soul at that point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You need to make a patch on the soul with investiture.

#### Kurkistan

So how's the investiture know where to go, what to look like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well your soul is an ideal. So if you can get it up there, there are ways to do- to recreate that with um- see I'm getting into stuff for later books.

#### Argent

No, thatâ€™s okay.

#### Kurkistan

So when Hemalurgy rips something off the soul, is that the ideal soul or some sub-soul?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is off of your soul, and it can be healed; but what it's going to be doing is creating a patch of new soul. So it will not be your original soul. Does that make sense?

#### Kurkistan

Okay, that- well, not completely, but I think that's your intention.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Store Employee

If you do that, is that like Frankenstein's monster, or is it like a graft that's absorb-

#### Brandon Sanderson

Less horrifying- Less horrifying than Frankenstein's monster, but it is a graft that is like- it is not your original soul.

#### Store Employee

Yeah, but in modern medicine stuff like that is absorbed-

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah; in this you will always have a scar on your soul that something else has patched over.

#### Kurkistan

So Kaladin shouldn't just keep getting his arm chopped?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[ignoring/not-hearing Kurkistan just now] But that is what happens with most forms of investiture in the first place.
