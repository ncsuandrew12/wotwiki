#### Question

So if you had a character in Wheel of Time who was in the cosmere, who would that be?
Jain Farstrider?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh Jain? That’s a good choice! Jain makes a lot of sense. I was going to say one of the Aelfinn or Eelfinn, ‘cause they cross dimensions already. That would be the most likely. But you could totally make an argument for Jain or one of the Heroes having fallen through the portal. I intentionally didn’t put any cosmere references into the Wheel of Time. It felt like hubris to do that. The cameo in the Wheel of Time for me is the sword that Robert Jordan’s cousin gave to me out of Robert Jordan’s collection, so I wrote my sword into it. So if you look, it’s not too hard to find, you’ll find Rand gets a new sword. That’s my sword. \*laughter\* I got it hanging on my wall with a little plaque that says “Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time” and then Robert Jordan’s name and his lifespan underneath. It’s very cool. It’s a katana out of his collection, it’s really cool.
