# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #83](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#83)

#### Question

[I love Writing Excuses and I’m actually going on the Retreat this year. I think the cruise is a good idea.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

See Mary did the Steampunk cruise, and she just kind of asked “Wait a minute, what are people paying for this?” and it was less than we had to charge them for the retreat at her house, because of all the food and stuff we had to do. We were like “Wait a minute, you can do this for the same price or less? Why are we doing this at her house?”

#### Question

Cruises are a blast.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’ve been on several and I’ve enjoyed everyone of them.

#### Question

The Alaska cruise has been one of the best experiences of my life. So it’s going to be good for writing and inspiration.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My cruise story is the Taravangian interlude [in Words of Radiance] was written on a cruise with my family. I sat on the little balcony to our room typing while everyone else went off and did stuff where there were people. And I was by myself and it was great.
