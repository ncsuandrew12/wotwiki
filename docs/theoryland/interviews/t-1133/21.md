#### Question

I was just interested in the religious aspects of the books--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Being religious myself I am fascinated by religion in all of its different forms. So I constantly find myself returning to religious concepts and dealing with them in my books. I donâ€™t look to put any sort of message into my books, I look to create characters who feel real and let them determine what the message of the book is, does that make sense? What they are passionate about. So what you get from the books will depend on which characters you empathize with.
