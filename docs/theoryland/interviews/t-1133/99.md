Do you have a plan for the entire concept of the cosmere?

Yes I do.

#### Question

Do you have an Allomancy dude fighting a Surgebinding dude?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah it’s going to be cool. It’s going to be super awesome. The Allomantic space battles are really great. It’s going to be like 15 years, sorry. But they are really cool.
