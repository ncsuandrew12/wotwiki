#### Question

Which of your books do you think would be most appropriate or interesting for your kids to live in? Or most fitting.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most interesting? hehe The most fitting… Well I’ve got a child named Joel and I wrote a book about a kid named Joel so it’s probably most fitting there.
