# [Interview #1133, Entry #35]: Chicago](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#35)

#### Question

Thank you for writing everything, and I know your guilty pleasure. And that’s why I want one of those special card things, otherwise I’ll reveal it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh you will? What’s my guilty pleasure?

#### Question

Writing the Alcatraz books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah, that is the guilty pleasure. Here you go.

#### Question

Are you going to continue writing those? Or is your guilty pleasure just writing “You are about to be sacrificed on a pile of old encyclopedias. I’m going to write five books where it doesn’t happen and then just stop”?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that would have been fun but I felt that the scene needed to be in the series. So the scene is in Book 5. But there is a different evil thing.

#### Question

I’ve actually read everything that you’ve published. I really only read Alcatraz because I thought “He really can’t be good at /children’s/ books”. My ex-girlfriends a preschool teacher, and I wanted her to have a book that was somewhat children’s.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are people who actively hate those books, because Alcatraz is so mean to the reader, they are so fourth-wall breaking.

#### Question

They’re not, I actually wrote a letter because I was waiting for so long and I knew you had so many people.
