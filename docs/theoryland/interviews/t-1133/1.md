#### Question

What’s your favorite RPG?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Pen and paper or computer?

#### Question

Hmm, give me computer.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dark Souls, lately.

#### Question

Seriously?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmhmm. Dark Souls is the only young series making games halfway close to the difficulty level of the games I grew up playing.

#### Argent

Oh yes.

#### Question

Old games were so much harder.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The new games are all like such cakewalks, so finding a game-- I don’t think Dark Souls is actually that hard.
