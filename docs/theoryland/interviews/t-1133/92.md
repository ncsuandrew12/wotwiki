#### Question

I noticed in a lot of your cosmere books, like for example Elantris or Mistborn, they have something to do with some sort of subject matter or school or something. For example the Steelpush and Ironpulling in Mistborn is based on physics.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

If you push too hard it’s based on...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vector physics, yes.

#### Question

And then like Warbreaker is just like math, adding Breaths together. Did you intend that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not necessarily. I read a lot and I like science and I like philosophy and I like and things like this. And those spark most of my ideas. So yes in a term but I’m not like “Let’s do this subject”. I would say Warbreaker, the big part of Warbreaker is the idea of sympathetic magic. Which is the idea that like affects like, which is a very common type of magic throughout all cultures on the planet, on our planet. When people believe in magic they believe in sympathetic magic. A voodoo doll is sympathetic magic. And that’s where the idea came from.

#### Question

So in Elantris, which is different and then--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah that’s basically fantasy programming, is where that one came from.

#### Question

And then there is the Stormlight Archive, which basically violates all the laws of physics by just saying everything comes from spren.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well no they still have arguments on that, are spren attracted to these things or do they cause them.

#### Question

Yeah that’s kind of weird…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Stormlight Archive was based on the fundamental forces, if you want go read on physics google fundamental forces.
