#### Question

Why would you choose Chicago as a setting?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I grew up in Nebraska, Lincoln, and Chicago was the big city we would travel to. I liked that it was-- This is kind of going to sound weird but it was a big city full of mid-westerners. Like when I went to LA everyone talked and acted different, when I went to New York everyone talked and acted different, but in Chicago it-- they were kind of like a bunch of hokey mid-westerners had somehow built a big city? \*laughter\* If that makes any sense. So I have always had a fondness for Chicago. It’s like the big city of farmers or whatnot. I don’t know there’s just something about it, the being on the lake and the profile of it and things like that. And I’m a Batman fan and Gotham is Chicago. Chicago was my go-to when I was going to destroy a city in our world; I picked Chicago.
