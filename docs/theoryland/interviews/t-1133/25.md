#### Question

Is there anything-- Is any of that going to be in the Encyclopedia coming up and are you doing anything with it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am not doing anything with it. It is all Harriet. In fact when Robert Jordan and she signed the contracts for it it was always going to be her project and not his.
