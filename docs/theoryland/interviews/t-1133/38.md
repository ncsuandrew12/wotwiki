#### Argent

If I may, how do you feel about Graphic Audio?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I, personally, love that they are available but I find them kind of distracting when I’m listening to them. Yeah. I’m glad-- I mean I want to sell as many of them as we can because there are some people who just love them. But I actually love straight reads, like I like Wil Wheaton’s reading, where there’s very minimal voices.

#### Argent

Well that’s because it’s Wil Wheaton.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is Wil Wheaton but I-- I do like Graphic Audio because they use women for women’s parts, men for men’s parts, which is really helpful. Men doing women’s voices in books, and Women doing men’s voices as readers, a lot of them are like fingernails on a chalkboard for me.
