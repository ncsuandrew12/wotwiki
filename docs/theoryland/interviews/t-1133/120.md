#### Kurkistan

So time bubbles... How much control does a bubbler have over the bubble before and after it's cast? Can they just grow and shrink it or...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not very much.

#### Kurkistan

So Wayne could flare his metals make time go faster--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Kurkistan

But if he'd stopped flaring--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, but-- they have a bit of control over the speed of it, but once it's up moving it or anything like that, not much. The flaring of it and things like that, yes they can-- it's mostly set when they start.

#### Kurkistan

But they have some discretion when they start it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They do have some discretion , yes.
