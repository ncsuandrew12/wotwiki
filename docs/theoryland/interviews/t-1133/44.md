#### Question

How did Kaladin heal his shardblade wound without the power of Regrowth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s partially a RAFO. Remember that healing in the cosmere usually has to do with how you view yourself. And as long as there is some outpouring of Investiture you are usually capable of healing. More the weird thing is not that Kaladin healed it’s that Szeth couldn’t.
