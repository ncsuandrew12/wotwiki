#### Question

Do you have any sort of set pattern for when you are getting ready to do a rewrite on a novel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I grit my teeth, bang my head against the wall, and try to do anything else except the rewrite.

#### Question

Yeah it’s...

#### Brandon Sanderson

You must be like me then, I hate revising but deadlines are what make me do it. Setting them on my own, you just have to learn to do it. The number one thing I think held me back as a writer is my dislike of revision. And it wasn’t until I learned to do it..

#### Question

And just get it done…

#### Brandon Sanderson

...and just get it done that I started writing books that would be publishable.
