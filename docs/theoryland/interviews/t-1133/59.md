#### Question

I really like your idea with the whole Mistborn series, taking it further in history and we are both PhD physicists.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh sweet.

#### Question

I always think about that and I was wondering if you were worried about going that sci-fi fantasy route? Like for instance--

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not worried about it, I’m just excited… In my mind all of my books are sci-fi as well as fantasy because I’m making weird new branches of physics and trying to adhere to as many of the laws as I can.

#### Question

Yeah that’s one of things I love about how well thought out the magic systems are.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Like I-- You are actually not the first physicists to come through another one came through earlier tonight and talking about the quantum mechanics that are in The Way of Kings.
