#### Question

Do you set out to write a specific-- like a teen book or an adult book? Or are they just--

#### Brandon Sanderson

I usually do set out these days. Originally I was not as cognizant of it, but I do think keeping audience in mind is an important attribute of writing. The thing is when you are doing a teen book its not about writing down it’s about dealing with issues, like it’s the type of conflicts that really make something a teen book in my opinion. And those conflicts can transcend into adult books but-- I don’t know it’s just there’s a feel for it.
