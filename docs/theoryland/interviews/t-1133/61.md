#### Argent

Awakening and Surgebinding, Stormlight and Breath seem really similar in some aspects--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Argent

--except Breaths seem to stick to things better--

#### Brandon Sanderson

They do.

#### Argent

--than Stormlight. So when you are holding the Breath it doesn’t expire when you put it in something it doesn’t go away. Can you tell me something about why that’s happening?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Part of this is kind of inherent to the Shard and the power it’s coming from. I mean the power of Endowment is just going to stick, that’s part of the nature of its magic. Does that make sense? But it also kind of has to do with how the ecosystems are working. For instance the Stormlight is essential to the ecosystem of Roshar, it needs to be expended, it needs to get out and-- It’s like evaporation, does that make sense?

#### Argent

Recycling? Not the recycling but the cycle of--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah like the cycle of water. And so just part of the way the nature of it works, it /has/ to get out, it /has/ to leak out, it has to run out. I mean it leaks even from spheres, right?

#### Argent

And when you lash things it’s temporary--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep. And even though Szeth says that he thought Voidbringers could hold it they can’t. Like it is just not the way that it works.

#### Argent

Can they just hold it better?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They can hold it better. It’s not permanent. Now there are things that can do it permanently but--

#### Argent

Like the black sphere for example?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well we are not going to...The black sphere is something different. You guys have guessed what the black sphere is, right?

#### Argent

Well we have some ideas. I support that it holds an Unmade. Am I wrong?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not going to answer that.

#### Argent

But you said--

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m just curious what the theories are. Book 3 the black sphere is-- Everyone who reads the books will know what the black sphere is by the end of Book 3.

#### Argent

I can live with that.
