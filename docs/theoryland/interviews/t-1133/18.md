#### Question

I’m a graphic designer and I want to know how you visually communicate-- You have such great visuals in your books...Do you draw them all? Or do you just tell someone what you need?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lots of practice. It really is just practice.
So I have artists. I commission concept art for my descriptions and then… That doesn’t always end up in the book. In fact usually it doesn’t. For the things that end up in the book I’ll often do like a quick sketch and say “make this awesome” or I’ll do a paragraph or two of description.
