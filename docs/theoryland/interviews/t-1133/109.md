# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #109](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#109)

#### Argent

Since Chicago came up, will Atlanta have a special name as well?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Atlanta will have a special name, it’s now a theme of the books.
Argent: Because Peter said “Hotlanta” and people think he’s joking, like he usually does.
Brandon: I’m not going to ruin one of Peter’s jokes if it indeed is a joke. But I haven’t written the book yet so he hasn’t read-- I mean I’ve written parts of it but he hasn’t read anything of the book.
