# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #95](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#95)

#### Question

Why do you do interludes? What possessed you to go that direction instead of just including it as another chapter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I felt that one of the foibles of the large series epic fantasy genre is the tendency of authors to go afield down paths of side characters. It happened to Robert Jordan, it happened to George R.R. Martin. And so reading theirs I hoped to learn from them and say “I’m going to do this thing that gives me a pressure valve to tell these stories that are outside the main line but I’m not going to give myself enough room that I can just turn this into a full character, yet.” That allows me to do goofy stuff around the world but have a form for it built into the book.
