#### Question

So I’m in the middle of Hero of Ages, and I’m noticing there are constant parallels between Vin and the Hero of Ages and Elend and the Lord Ruler? Is it going to hurt?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s done intentionally. Is the ending going to hurt? The ending is the right ending. It’s going to be satisfying, but it also might hurt.
