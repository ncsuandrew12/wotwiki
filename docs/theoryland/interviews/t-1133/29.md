#### Question

Yes. Also what is it about about the Fantasy genre in particular that lends itself to these sorts of questions about the nature of religion?
It’s the same reason why I like Star Trek, you can kind of create a scenario and--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well I think that there are a lot of things. One of them is that fantasy is one of these genres where we can take away a lot of the contemporary baggage. For instance, since it is hard to talk about things like the Catholic Church and the religion without getting into the social issues in our world right now, but if you create a fake religion that you can narrow down and focus on one aspect of it-- Fantasy is really good at that. Tolkien did it with racism, let’s have an elf and a dwarf and have them interact, and take away all the baggage of civil rights era America or England and instead said “let’s see if these two races can get along”
But I also think that because of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis having such an influence on the genre you can do Good vs Evil, which lends itself. Like Robert Jordan’s works there’s no religion there’s just a lot of spirituality. So there is no religion because people can actively check and see if God is real, the Creator. The magic is there, it’s the proof, they don’t /need/ a religion. Which is a really interesting way to approach it.
