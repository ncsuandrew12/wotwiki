#### Question

At the end of Firefight when it says that if you overcome your fears that the corruption kind of ceases to exist. Does that mean an Epic’s weakness is resolved [also?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a question for the sequel.

#### Question

So would that imply that maybe David has a power but he doesn’t know it because he overcame the water fear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s entirely possible… You’re asking good questions.
