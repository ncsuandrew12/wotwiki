#### Kurkistan

So, could you give us some examples of how the ideals that spren represent work in other magic systems, like we have Forging where you get plausibility, or Returned how they're beautiful or any other systems?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, one more time on that.

#### Kurkistan

Okay, so you know the ideals the spren are manifestations--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Kurkistan

How-- Do those have impacts on other magic systems?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, yes, in the same way the Returned- that's the exact same system at work there.

#### Kurkistan

Is it the same reason why the Lord Ruler has to die of old age, and why you can't heal yourself into being an octopus or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um... Yes, that is all connected in the exact same way.

#### Kurkistan

Okay, so it's all like these high falutin' spiritual ideals?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Kurkistan

And are there like, median Cognitive ideals that gradually kind of influence these, or--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, they transcend between the three. I mean the original concept for the three realms is Platonic philosophy.

#### Kurkistan

So it goes up \*makes absurd reverse-waterfall hand gesture\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it goes up and it comes back down. A lot of the Cognitive is-- So like, the Cognitive has a bigger effect on how you can heal and things like that. Does that make sense?

#### Kurkistan

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But the power to heal is a actually a spiritual thing.

#### Kurkistan

So it's like the spiritual says "I want to be like this" and the Cognitive is like "okay I'll try really hard to be like that, but I have a limit."

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right. Right. Filtered through how you see yourself, yeah.
