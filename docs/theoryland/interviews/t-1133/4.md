#### Question

What is the favorite character you have written?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What is the favorite character that I have written? I would say Perrin, from The Wheel of Time. Because I can’t pick my own characters, because they don’t feel like I’m-- They are my favorite while I’m writing them, whoever they are. But Perrin was my favorite Wheel of Time character and when I got to finish the Wheel of Time he was the character that Robert Jordan left the least amount of notes on. In fact there was one sentence, for three books-worth, about him. And so I got to take him and really Perrin was the one I had the most influence on through the course of those three books and it was very special to me him being my favorite character and being able to do that.
