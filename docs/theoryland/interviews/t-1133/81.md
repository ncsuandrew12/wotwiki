# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #81](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#81)

#### Question

My question has to do with the color of Shallan’s eyes currently, because we’ve noticed over the books that Kaladin’s eyes, as he’s continued to use his Surge, changed to lighter and lighter blue. Whereas one could argue that Shallan is farther in her Ideals than Kaladin is, yet her eyes have not changed at all.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, ‘cause they were already light.

#### Question

‘Cause they were already light? So it only affects lightness or darkness in the eyes, not necessarily any other color?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s not like it is-- It’s not like it’s saying “Light minus 50%”.

#### Question

It’s not like Honor is blue and--

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It is not. It is just kind of the way that the changes the Stormlight is making the body and certain people are already descended from people who had repeated, over time, changes by the body which stopped physically… That’s not to say that all lighteyes that’s where they came from. There are some that are natural mutations.
