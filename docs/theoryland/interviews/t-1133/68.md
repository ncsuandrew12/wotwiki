#### Question

I’m 66 in a couple months and I want to make sure I live long enough to read the whole Stormlight--Am I going to? I just retired so I have plenty of time to read.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You’ll definitely make it through the first five. The thing about it is I’ll break in the middle, but the first five come to a natural climax, and then there’s an in-world break of 15 years. Not 15 years away for us but an in-world break. And then I’ll do another trilogy. I think you’ll make it through them all. I think you’ll easily make it, you look very hale and healthy.
