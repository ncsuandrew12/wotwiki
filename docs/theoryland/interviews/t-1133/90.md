#### Question

How has the fantasy publishing industry changed with the global popularity of [...]

#### Brandon Sanderson

It has changed, but really what we’re seeing is what happened in the States in the seventies, the States and the UK following Tolkien, is now happening in a lot of countries that it hadn’t happened in before. Which is cool. But it’s not just Game of Thrones, since the Lord of the Rings movies, it’s Harry Potter. The last ten years are wakening fantasy. See the thing about fantasy is we don’t find fantasy doing well in developing countries. It’s kind of the thing where if you are going to be reading about knights and wizards, you are not going to be somebody who’s struggling for your bread each day. You know what I mean?

#### Question

People in developing countries read more aspirational--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So you see for instance as countries transition out of that you see a lot of fantasy and things. For instance it happened in Japan in the seventies. It happened in the US even earlier. It’s happening now in Brazil and Taiwan. Those are two of the places where it is just appearing. India, it’s just starting in India. Mainland China hasn’t quite caught on yet but there’s hints that it is going to happen. But it has been in Europe for quite a while.

#### Question

So do you have translations of your books in Portuguese?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I’m in 26 languages, or something like that. But you can kind of use that as a map for the places that read-- you know. Like the only South American country is Brazil, I don’t have any other distribution in South America. Not a single country in Africa, except South Africa, the UK editions. None of those. Japan, China, Korea? Yes. Europe? Almost everybody in Europe.
