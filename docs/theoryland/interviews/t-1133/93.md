#### Question

What was the hardest part of finishing the Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The hardest part, I would say, was the battle logistics.

#### Question

So A Memory of Light took a while?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, A Memory of Light is all battle logistics, it was really hard. And the second half was really tough to get that all right. And just to work with the assistants and things like that.
