#### Kurkistan

Okay, so I'm contractually obligated to ask about time bubbles one more time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Kurkistan

So what's up with frame of reference for time bubbles; in that obviously if you make a bubble and it's still it's not really still, like time moves differently but-

#### Brandon Sanderson

We deal with that a little bit in Era 2 Book 2 [Shadows of Self], where we talk about the fact that you know- obviously the bubble is moving with the planet. So they're not-- the frame of reference is not absolute.

#### Kurkistan

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And so we talk about sorta' the idea of mass and momentum and time bubbles and things like that.

#### Kurkistan

Okay

#### Brandon Sanderson

For instance you can make a time bubble on a train.

#### Kurkistan

Oh and it stays on the train?!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but when you start catching stuff off of the train, it's gonna' jar each time, and it's probably going to ruin your time bubble, right?

#### Kurkistan

So does it get it's "anchor" from-- it's asking all the things that are within it what they think "still" is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. That's a good way of looking at it. Frame of reference for the cognitive things around. Make sense?

#### Kurkistan

Okay; the things around or the things within it, specifically?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The things that it's cutting into, specifically, but yeah.
