#### Kurkistan

Could a Feruchemist manipulate their identity such that they could make a metalmind that anyone could tap?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah... RAFO.

#### Kurkistan

Okay; could they manipulate their identity such that they could pull Breaths out of something that somebody else Awakened?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah.. ahahah, Awakened, oh yeah... That one's going to be harder, but you're thinking along-- You're thinking with portals. \*smiles\* Do you know what that means.

#### Kurkistan

Yes, I know what it means--

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're starting to think with portals.

#### Kurkistan

I'm thinking with portals, okay, thank you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. In other words you're wrapping your head around the way that the magic system is working, so.

#### Argent

Thatâ€™s so excellent.
