#### Question

I was wondering about , how much of your day do you spend writing? Because you have five(?) books coming out, I didn’t count them all.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I’ve only got two books this year. I do two books a year, with a third book occasionally. It just depends on how long the books are. For instance a Way of Kings book is four of these [Firefight?] in length, so when I do a Stormlight book you get less, fewer other books. When I do-- For instance I can do two of these [Reckoners?] and two Mistborn books in the same length of time. I work a normal workday usually, plus a little bit… I don’t write particularly fast. I do write a large amount but mostly I’m very consistent. I just write a little bit each day and then it happens.
