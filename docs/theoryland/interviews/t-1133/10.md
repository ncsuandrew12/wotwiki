#### Question

When you develop a character, like as the change over time, does it come naturally or do you have to force it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As I develop characters and they change over time, does that come naturally or do I have to force it? For me it comes very naturally. I do a lot of planning ahead of time on my plots and a /lot/ of planning ahead of time on my settings. I do less on my characters. I cast people in roles. I start writing someone in this role and I see what becomes of them in the first few chapters and if I’m not liking that I put it aside and cast someone else in that role and write for a few chapters and then set that aside until I find a mix that I like and then it is a very natural progression as I write them. That’s just the way that it works for me. It’s a matter of practice making that happen.
