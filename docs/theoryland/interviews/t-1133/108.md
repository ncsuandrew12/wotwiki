#### Question

Are there differences in pronunciation between the different worlds in the cosmere? Do you have any record of that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. So, it depends on the culture and things like that, what it’s going to be like. You can kind of bet in Mistborn it’s going to be French, if it’s from the central dominance. So they’ll say “Kelsi-ay” and “Demou” but where Elend’s from is a lot more Germanic so “EE-lend” “Strahff” and stuff like that. The other worlds are all going to have their things. In Roshar you are going to get some of the “YAS-nah kho-LIN” [kho being a back of throat guttural sound, kind of like Scottish “ch” as in loch] it’s going to be a little more semitic in its language family.
