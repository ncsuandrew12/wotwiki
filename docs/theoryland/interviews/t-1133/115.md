#### Question

So the first one is Kaladin’s backstory, the second is Shallan’s backstory, who’s next?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually haven’t been able to decide yet. It’s going to be one of the five for the first five books are Kaladin and Shallan and then Dalinar, Szeth, and Eshonai and I can’t decide which one matches the next book best. And I’m going to have to write it...

#### Argent

What’s the current list for the back five?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Current list for the back five… Jasnah, Lift, Ash, Renarin, and Taln.
