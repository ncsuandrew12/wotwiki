#### Question

When you finish a book how do you celebrate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I usually, unless I have a really tight deadline, I pick a video game and I play the video game. Usually once a year I’ll do that and I’ll take like two weeks off and just play through a game.

#### Question

I like that idea. I’m trying to finish up my master’s thesis and deciding what I can do when I’ve finished it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh okay, I don’t know if you can take two weeks off.

#### Question

Well I’ve already told my boss I’m going to take three weeks off. But i’ll probably go somewhere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

See traveling, I travel so much for work that I don’t really want to go anywhere. I just want to stay home where I don’t have to do anything. I played Skyrim, I broke it out over the holidays. I hadn’t ever played that one. That’s my latest.
