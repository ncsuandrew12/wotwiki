#### Question

Is there any possibility of the novellas being released in like a bound--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, we will eventually do-- Tor really wants to do a collection of all the cosmere novellas. So like… [Brandon stumbles over the words] Shadows for Silence, The Emperor’s Soul, Sixth of the Dusk. But I was trying to say Shadows for Silence but I almost said Shadows of Self, that’s going to be a problem for me going forward, using Shadows in two. But all of those in one collection is what we’re probably going to see.
