# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #117](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#117)

#### Question

Who would you wait in line this long to get a book signed from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Terry Pratchett in a heartbeat.

#### Question

Yeah, yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan, my first question would be “How’d you come back?” \*laughter\*

#### Question

You might have to get him tell you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’ve waited when I was younger, I don’t have to do it anymore, but when I was younger I waited this long for Orson Scott Card. The thing is most authors these days I wouldn’t have to wait for, like most of them are my pals and things. But there are some that aren’t. Like if I could get my copy of Watchmen signed, I would wait for him.

#### Question

It might be kind of hard to get him to go anywhere

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, or to do anything. Or to not just curse about-- But yes.

#### Question

About everyone in the industry.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But if you could wait in a three hour line to get Alan Moore to sign your book it would be worth it, right?
