#### Question

I was wondering when you first thought to put Nightblood in Words of Radiance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood in Words of Radiance happened because… So I wrote the original draft of Way of Kings in 2002 and Vasher was Kaladin’s swordmaster and I thought “This guy has a really interesting past, he’s not natively from Roshar”. So I went and wrote his backstory and that became the book Warbreaker. So he predates-- And then I came back and I re-wrote Way of Kings and I cut him out of it to save him for the later books. So when did I first think of it? Well 2003 probably? Was where that was happening.

#### Question

Nightblood was our apartment's collective favorite character.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have some other quote-unquote cons going on the fans so to speak that are going to be very cool when they happen.
