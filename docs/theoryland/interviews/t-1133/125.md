# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #125](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#125)

#### Argent

We’ve noticed that each world, or most worlds, seem to have something that Investiture likes to stick to. So on Nalthis it’s life, on Roshar it’s gems, metal on Scadrial… Do you have a term for those things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not have one yet. But I probably should.

#### Footnote

question about a concept in-universe that Brandon has not made up a word for yet
