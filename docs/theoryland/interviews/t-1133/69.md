# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#69)

#### Question

Did I read that they were going to make a movie out of Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The question is-- Somebody bought the rights. The question is whether they are actually going to use them for anything, and that I can’t say. I really like the people who have them.

#### Question

Would you be involved in it if--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I would be involved.

#### Question

How much?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The contracts say I have to be able to go to the set at any time.

#### Question

You wouldn’t be helping writing the screenplay?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh I don’t write screenplays, it’s a different skill. I think you do an expert do what an expert does. But so far they have sent me all of the stuff they’ve done and I’ve given feedback and they’ve taken it. It’s a good sign.

#### Question

In your opinion what percent--

#### Brandon Sanderson

How close?

#### Question

--that they are going to start it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

15?

#### Question

That small?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s high. I think that’s very high for this business. My agent says one out of 30 gets made.

#### Question

So what’s the criteria they would--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Investors, if there are people who are willing to give us a 100 million dollars… So if you happen to know anyone willing to sink a 100 million dollars into a film we could do it tomorrow.
