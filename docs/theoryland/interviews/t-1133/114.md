#### Question

In your talk earlier about character arcs do you have a character who surprised you the most in how they ended up developing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Spook from the Mistborn books, he was not in the original outline having the role he did in the third book. But when I finished the second book I was like “Ennnh he’s grown into something that needs more exploration”.
