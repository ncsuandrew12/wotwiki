#### Question

Why didn’t you have Vin talk to Hoid? She sort of saw him and then just ran off.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not answered that question yet. But that means you can have one of these [RAFO card].

#### Argent

That doesn’t come up very often but we got it twice.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it’s not that big of a thing.

#### Argent

You should take the hint.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are going to have to wait a while to get that answer.
