# [Interview #1133: Chicago, Entry #80](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1133#80)

#### Question

I do have a question for you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, you want the Ghostblood symbol. I think this is the one we settled on, but Isaac has final say on art things. So you might have the one that was the one before we settled on one.

#### Question

That means it’s unique.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it’s unique, but I’m pretty sure that’s what we settled on.
