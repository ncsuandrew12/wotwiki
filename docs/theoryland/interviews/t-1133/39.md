#### Question

When it comes to major, pivotal plot twists. Moments where the reader goes “WOAH” or “Oh my god”. Are those something you write as starting point or ending point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What I do is I plot my outline backward, starting with those scenes. And then I write the book forward to those scenes. The reason I can do it that way is because in the plot I don’t need to know the characters’ emotional state, I can just come up with “This is going to be a great scene”. But I have to have been with the characters through the journey to write their reaction to the scene. So I can’t actually write it early.
