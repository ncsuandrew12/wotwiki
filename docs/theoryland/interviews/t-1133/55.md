#### Question

So a lot of your books are very cinematic in nature and lend themselves very well to other forms of media and I was wondering if you had to choose what would you do-- video games…

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would want to do all of those.

#### Question

All of the things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I would love to do a big cross-media sort of deal. Whatever I can get away with, right? So we’re doing a White Sand comic book right now, you probably know about that. White Sand, my unpublished novel, we’re doing a graphic novel of that. I’m working hard to get the movies made, I will do anything I can get made. Just because I love storytelling in all its different weird varieties.

#### Question

There’s the Mistborn dice game, do you know of anything for The Stormlight Archive? If they’re ever going to do something with that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think the thing we are going to do with Stormlight Archive-- We’re going to try a chasm assault boardgame. Where you put together chasms and bridges and things like that. That’s what we think would work really well. We have a developer-- well game designer who wants to do one of those so we’re going to work with them and try to get it made.
