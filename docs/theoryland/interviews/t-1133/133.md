#### Argent

Are there power modifiers for Soulstamps like there are for AonDor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Argent

Yes… Does Shai know them-- Or any of them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um… Hehehehehe…

#### Argent

Not “has she used them”, I’m not going to go there, but does she know any of them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She knows more than she thinks she does.
