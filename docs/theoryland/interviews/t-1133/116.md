#### Question

I know at the end of Words of Radiance Syl shows she can turn into different forms, not just a sword. Why do they not-- Or why do none of the other past Radiants really show that they have done that. Because normally in the flashbacks they are shown just being swords.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So the shardblades came from spren seeing the Honorblades, which were created for mankind, and being like “I can do that”. That is what they were imitating.

#### Question

So that’s what they wanted--

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that’s how they see themselves and how they are seen. They can change into other things--

#### Question

They just never--

#### Brandon Sanderson

But when you let go of one it’s going to become a sword again.

#### Question

Oh, I just meant in all the visions they were always portrayed as swords. Was that just for--

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s cultural, like this is-- One thing that is interesting is you are going to see that the new Radiants don’t have-- I mean the Radiants you have seen almost all of them are after thousands of years of Radiants and Orders and you have certain things that you do. So the writing reason was I didn’t want to give away--

#### Question

That’s what I was going to ask.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a writing reason behind it. I didn’t want to do that and give too much away. I already worried that having Syl shift shapes as often as she did through the first book was going to be a big clue to people and I wanted to hold off on giving away too much.
