#### Question

What you do with religions in your world, in your stories more generally. [...] Tokien, he says his books are fundamentally Catholic works, but he never mentions religion explicitly. It kind of just breathes religious air, is the way I describe it. So like you address religion in your books with the characters, sometimes positively sometimes negatively. How do you deal with that in your world and in your books, like with the air that they breathe kind of, to steal the metaphor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah I just-- The characters are everything to the books. What they are passionate about becomes what the book is about. For me my job in writing is to explore different sides of issues through the eyes of different people. That said, who I am shapes what I am interested in and what ends up in the books. I think at the end of the day I think you could call my books fundamentally Mormon books, in the way that Tolkien’s were fundamentally Catholic, because I can’t separate myself from my religion. I am trying to explore the world through the eyes of people who see the world differently from the way I see it.

#### Question

So you would say you’re-- Through your characters-- It comes out through how different people would approach it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s my goal.

#### Question

So how then, does Mormonism affect, like you said-- In what way would you say your books are fundamentally Mormon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well if the philosopher in me steps aside, and the writer in me just wrote what the writer is passionate about. If the trained english major says-- One of the biggest fundamental tenets of Mormonism is deification of normal people, right? Mormonism believes that we are gods in embryo and we are here to learn and have experience so we will be better in the afterlife, and growing and we’ll eventually-- Joseph Smith taught “What Man is God once Was, and what God is Man may Become” maybe not “will be” but “may become” That’s what he said. And so if you look at my books there’s a whole bunch of deification going on, right? That’s like fundamental to the cosmere is “What do people do with the power of the gods when they’re given it?” And I would say that’s totally my upbringing that made me fascinated about that. Does that make sense?

#### Question

Yeah, i never thought about that. Fantasy really lends itself to that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it does. But I mean deification of a normal person is a very Christian tenet also, it’s just one person did it, and it was a person who was God before, but it is still part of that whole thing which is part of why I think Christianity and Fantasy ended up kind of hand in hand.
