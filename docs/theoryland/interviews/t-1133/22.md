#### Question

You have said you are an architect, so I was wondering if the plot twists at the end of the book, did you have those at the beginning?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say most of the time I have them at the beginning but sometimes during the writing I rebuild my outline to do something different. You always have to be open to that I feel as an architect, to rebuilding your plot for when the creative process takes you in a different direction.
