#### Question

So are the rumors true are you [and Pat Rothfuss] going to write a book together?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but every time we are on a panel we are like “AH we should write a book together.” It’s highly unlikely, that we would ever do anything together. Just because our writing styles are so different. Pat’s writing process-- It’s not so much style it’s the writing process-- is so different. But you can hold out hope. Perhaps some day I will have a pitch for Pat or something like that. But I would hate to inconvenience his fans by distracting him with something else.
