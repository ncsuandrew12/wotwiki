#### Question

So what are your thoughts on the Wheel of Time pilot?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Time pilot? I… think… See this is kind of on the record because of the recording. I think the actors and the director are to be praised for doing so much with so little time. I don’t think it should have been made and I don’t think it is a good direction for the Wheel of Time to be going. But that is in part because I know Harriet was not pleased with it.
