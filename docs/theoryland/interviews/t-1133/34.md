#### Question

I was curious Mat and then the second-hand man Talmanes… Did you have inspiration for those-- Because I absolutely enjoyed, I laughed out loud multiple times reading those characters. And I wondered--

#### Brandon Sanderson

With Mat it was always just me trying to match Robert Jordan’s style, sometimes awkwardly at first but I think I got it down. With Talmanes there was more room for interpretation because I had always-- In fandom people interpret his personality in a lot of different ways, and I was a certain theory because we’d never seen through his eyes. When I did write scenes through his eyes I used my interpretation. There are some people “No that’s not how he is”. There are some people “Yes I always knew he was like that”. But that’s how I’ve always viewed him, with kind of the tongue in his cheek as he’s talking to Mat. And I’ve always loved him as a character because of that. Which is why I wanted to write him and include him. There weren't any notes to use him.
