#### Question

How do you come up with the ideas for the powers and the names of the Epics?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The names are actually really hard because comic book heroes, there are so many names they’ve already used. And so I have to a lot of searching and thinking and it’s usually my fifth choice. Lots of looking in the thesaurus for “alright was a word that is like this one that has been used way too often”. The powers I’m look for usually something cool that somebody has done in a movie or a book or a comic book that I don’t think they extrapolated far enough. I’m like “No that’s not how it would really work. This is how I think it would really work” and kind of taking my own spin on it.
