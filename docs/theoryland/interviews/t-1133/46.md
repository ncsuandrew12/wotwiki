#### Question

Can someone be sacrificed for both Hemalurgy and the magics of Dakhor simultaneously?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So this is going to require the soul being ripped apart, so it depends on what pieces of the soul are left and how easily you can capture them. That’s a theoretical possible-- possibility… Know that most of the horrors of Dakhor are twisting a soul not stealing a soul.
