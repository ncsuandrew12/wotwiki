#### Question

Do you ever write like two versions of a scene in a book and if you do how do you decide which--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Two versions of the same scene. I do it quite frequently. Every book there will be a couple times. Usually what happens is I’m writing a scene and I’m not pleased with it and so I put it aside and I write it again the next day. And usually letting me subconscious work on it means I end up fixing it. About one out of ten times I start writing it and I realize “It was right the first way, why am I writing something new?” And then I just go back to the book, and it wasn’t that the scene was bad it’s just I had a bad day. And sometimes you do, no matter what you write you are going to think it stinks. How do I decide? It’s very instinctive, I’ve never had one like “These are both equally good” Always I know one of them is not working. In fact the best way to get over writer’s block, I find, is to write the scene anyway, have anything you can think of happen--even if it doesn’t make sense in your story--so that you get the scene out, and then attack it again the next day after you have had time to think about it.
