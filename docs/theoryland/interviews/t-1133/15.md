#### Question

Did you purposely make the Church of the Survivor sort of like Christianity or not?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kelsier intentionally made it like Christianity. In kind of a false way, meaning he read about and had Sazed tell him about religions that were similar and then he built that his own way.
