#### Argent

Does Lift turn food into investiture directly or is it similar to the metals on--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Similar to the metals.

#### Argent

So like a gate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Argent

Okay, that’s good to know.

#### Brandon Sanderson

She can metabolize-- She can draw-- It’s not actually the food, it’s-- It’s not like the metals, not exactly. It’s not-- What she can do is she can metabolize into investiture instead of sugar. Does that make sense?

#### Argent

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

We metabolize food into sugar. She can metabolize it into investiture. Does that make sense?

#### Argent

That makes a lot of sense. So if she eats--

#### Brandon Sanderson

She’s got to have a blood sugar spike.

#### Argent

So if she eats like a cake it will give her more investiture--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Faster. It will give her faster.

#### Argent

Whereas if she eats a vegetable...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vegetable... More calories is going to equal more. But the better comparison would be a sausage and bread. Because bread is a fast blood sugar spike and the sausage is not. And that’s how I’m working in my head. It’s kind of a magical version of a blood sugar spike and I have it happen to her faster than it could happen. Like normally you eat a piece of bread and your blood sugar spikes in a half hour, it’s going to go faster for Lift.

#### Argent

Her’s is like five minutes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Her’s is like five minutes, but a sausage would be slower.
