# [Interview #873: AMOL Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=873#2)

#### Marie Curie

We found out in
*Knife of Dreams*
that some of the Forsaken (most especially Moridin) are able to 'read' the Pattern to locate
*ta'veren*
, for example. How (or where) do they 'read' the Pattern? Do they use
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
? Or the Gap of Infinity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know. (Brandon looks at Maria)

#### Maria Simons

I don't know. It might be in the notes.

#### Footnote

Lanfear/Cyndane can also do it; the Talent is probably related to Dreaming.
