# [Interview #873: AMOL Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=873#3)

#### Marie Curie

Brandon always tells
[the story](http://torforge.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/reading-the-final-scene-of-the-wheel-of-time/)
about going to your house in Charleston for the first time, and you had some soup on the stove, which you offered to him. But he just wanted to read the ending. My question is: Did he ever eat the soup?

#### Harriet McDougal

(laughs) Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

(listening in) Yes, I did have the soup later. And it was very good.

#### Marie Curie

It was bean soup, wasn't it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it was black bean soup.
