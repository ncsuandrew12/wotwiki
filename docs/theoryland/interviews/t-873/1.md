# [Interview #873: AMOL Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=873#1)

#### Marie Curie

Brandon, Harriet, and Maria were at the Barnes and Noble in Skokie, IL (Chicagoland) on January 9, 2013. There was no reading at this event; they jumped directly to the Q&A. I taped the Q&A, and that will be transcribed and reported on separately.

The questions and answers below are only the ones that I asked during the signing. Because of the way that the bookstore structured the signing area and line, it wasn't really easy to listen in on other questions being asked during the signing. The questions and answers are paraphrased . . . things weren't really set up for me to be able to easily record them.
