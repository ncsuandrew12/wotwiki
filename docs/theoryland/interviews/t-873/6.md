#### Marie Curie

RJ always said that he included a piece of you in each of his female characters. Other than
[being likened to Semirhage when you asked RJ to take out the garbage](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#4)
, can you identify the specific parts of the main characters (like Egwene or Nynaeve or Moiraine) that are from you? Did you and RJ discuss it at all?

#### Harriet McDougal

He didn't consult with me on this. (laughter) As for characters, I tend to be like the one who offers up tea with lemon and honey.
