#### Marie Curie

What about Cadsuane's contingent of Aes Sedai? We know that she gathered sisters to her, and we see several with her throughout the books. What about the others? And what about those at the Silver Swan? Were they hers?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know about the others. There may be something more definitive in the notes about the ones at the Silver Swan, but I'm not sure.
