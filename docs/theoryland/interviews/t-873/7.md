# [Interview #873: AMOL Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=873#7)

#### Marie Curie

We know that when the Tower split, about one third of Aes Sedai sided with Elaida, one third sided with the rebels, and one third stood apart. Aside from those who were Black among the ones that stood apart, when the Tower was reunited, did those sisters return to the Tower?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know. I imagine that some returned, but I'm not aware of the disposition of all of them.
