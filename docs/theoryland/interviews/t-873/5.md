# [Interview #873: AMOL Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=873#5)

#### Marie Curie

In
*The Gathering Storm*
, Rand says to Nynaeve: "Dream on my behalf, Nynaeve. Dream for things I no longer can." Was this a red herring? Or was it a completely innocent statement?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It wasn't a red herring. I meant it as a completely innocent statement. It was just about Rand telling Nynaeve to keep on wishing for him to be able to live.
