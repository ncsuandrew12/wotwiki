# [Interview #873: AMOL Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=873#9)

#### Marie Curie

We know that during the War of Power, entire cities were destroyed by balefire. It doesn't seem like (up until
*A Memory of Light*
, at least) enough balefire had been used during the Third Age to be anything close to what was used in the War of Power. Can you speak a little more about the cumulative effects? How much balefire is required before the Pattern starts to be significantly affected?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My interpretation of the way it works is that it's about a lot of balefire over a short period of time (and in a localized position) that causes the most serious damage to the Pattern. Cracks form in reality (like we see in
*A Memory of Light*
) when this occurs. The Pattern can sort of heal itself if the balefire ceases. It's kind of like an engine overheating.
