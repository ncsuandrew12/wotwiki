## [Entry #1](./t-661/1)

I looked around for other reports from the [East of the Sun] convention and found this one.

## [Entry #2](./t-661/2)

#### Brandoch Daha

In 1995, I helped arrange a fantasy convention in Stockholm, "East of the Sun," and one of our author guests of honor was Robert Jordan. A very nice man, I might add. In my interview with him, I asked why he wrote so much (at the time, only the first six books had been published, nota bene).

#### Robert Jordan

His response was interesting and enlightening. You need many words to fully tell a story, was his answer, plain and simple. There's only one reason why authors
*don't*
write five, six, and ten book series: They are lazy. A good story is long, complete, and omits nothing.

#### BRANDOCH DAHA

In other words, Robert Jordan has absolutely no clue what a good literary text looks like.

## [Entry #3](./t-661/3)

#### Brandoch Daha

Another question I asked was why men and women keep talking past each other in the books.

#### Robert Jordan

His answer to that question was that that's how it really is. Men and women think too differently to really understand each other; that's a biological impossibility. His books simply reflect this fact.

#### BRANDOCH DAHA

However, I never asked why the main characters all have a mental age of thirteen. But as I said, a sympathetic Southern gentleman he is. (Though his wife was even nicer.)
