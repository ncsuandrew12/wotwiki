#### Question (Paraphrased)

Twenty-first—Any future children's books?

Yes, really enjoys it. Nothing until after Steelheart/Rithmatist/Alcatraz, but wants to write about a world where wireless energy happens naturally and everything is electrified. That'll be the next kids' book, but it'll take a bit to get the science right. Also discusses plot from POV of the "Dark One" who is fated to be killed by the Chosen Hero—this might be the plot for the electrified planet but maybe not, as it's definitely cosmere.
