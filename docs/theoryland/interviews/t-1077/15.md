#### Question (Paraphrased)

Fifteenth—Is there something that inspires the strength of his female characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

His mother graduated first in her class in accounting in a year when she was the only woman in the accounting department. First three fantasy writers he read were female (Melanie Rawn, Anne McCaffrey, and one other I missed) to the point where when someone tried to give him Eddings he said he didn’t think men could write the genre.
