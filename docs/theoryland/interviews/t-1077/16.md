# [Interview #1077: WoR Signing Report - Kogiopsis, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1077#16)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

Sixteenthâ€”There's a rumor about a second Elantris book.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, that's coming someday, but Stormlight is the priority. Current schedule: Firefight is done, Rithmatist 2 is next, Stormlight 3 after that (working title might still be Stones Unhallowed if he can get it out before Rothfuss finishes Doors of Stone)
