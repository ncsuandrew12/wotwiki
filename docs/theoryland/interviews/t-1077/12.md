# [Interview #1077: WoR Signing Report - Kogiopsis, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1077#12)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

Twelfth—Is it challenging to write from the POV of a female character and why/why not.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Early on—yes it was, now less so. Problem was: treated characters other than the main character as roles only, centered around main character. "Writing characters without giving them their due". "You have to be able to write the other. Every character has to be a piece of you and a piece of not you." Discusses Jasnah in particular. Point of literature is "to see what it's like to be people who aren't us".
