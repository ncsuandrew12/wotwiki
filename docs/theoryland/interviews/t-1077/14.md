#### Question (Paraphrased)

Fourteenthâ€”Have you ever considered writing a horror novel or dark fantasy?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, played with it, wrote a short story for a Charlene Harris anthology coming out this year and a book called
*Death by Pizza*
about a necromancer running a pizza shop. Is glad dark fantasy exists, but "fantasy is the language of imagination and the language of hope" (quoting Robert Jordan) and will write about mostly people he would like to be/admires.

#### Footnote

The short story is called "Dreamer" and is included in the anthology
*Games Creatures Play*
.
