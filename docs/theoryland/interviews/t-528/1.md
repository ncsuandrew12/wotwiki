# [Interview #528: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: The Great Hunt Update, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=528#1)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Hi all, Brandon's assistant Peter here. He's off on his tour (Thursday's stop is in the Chicago area), so he doesn't have a lot of time to update the blog. He did write one blog post ahead of time, which I'll post tomorrow probably. And you can keep track of his progress on

and

.

Brandon wanted me to give everyone an update on the promotion for
*Towers of Midnight*
that Brandon & Tor are doing in conjunction with the
*The Way of Kings*
tour. (The book, by the way, was just announced today as having hit #7 on the
*New York Times*
bestseller list to be released in ten days or so. Congrats, Brandon!) This promotion is being called The Great Hunt; Brandon is dropping clues in every stop on his tour that will slowly reveal more of the encrypted text
[found here](http://brandonsanderson.com/thegreathunt)
. As I write this, 17 clues have been found or guessed outright. Brandon wanted me to list the clues and who found them, but . . . why should I duplicate effort? ;) Terez from
[Theoryland](http://theoryland.com/)
is already doing a great job at exactly that. So I suggest you
[pop over to this page](https://docs.google.com/View?docID=dcjspjqg_881z2xd56fn&revision=_latest)
if you want a roundup of all clues currently found or guessed. Brandon also adds more information more or less daily on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
