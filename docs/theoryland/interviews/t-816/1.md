# [Interview #816: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Today, I got up and I did not have a Wheel of Time book to work on., Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=816#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I finished the final revision on
*A Memory of Light*
early in the morning Saturday, then sent it off to Team Jordan. And I was done. Team Jordan will handle the copyedits and proofreads; I might have a chime-in now and then on how a passage should be tweaked or how a continuity issue should be addressed, but essentially, my involvement as a writer in the Wheel of Time has come to an end.

Now, that doesn't mean my involvement with Wheel of Time fandom is over. I'll have my appearance at Dragon\*Con this year, as well as the tour in January for
*A Memory of Light*
. Beyond that, I intend to frequently attend JordanCon and be available to WoT fans for years, even decades, to come. I intend to talk a great deal about the experience of writing these books, perhaps even post some blog entries about the subject.

But the writing is done. I'm still a little in shock about that.
