#### Question

In the Wheel of Time mythos, how do extinct animals come back into existence when the Wheel comes back around?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, the world I created is based on the ideas and conceptions of the world from a roughly medieval viewpoint; time being circular and such. I didn't quite try to make it completely scientifically accurate, so there really is no answer for the question.
