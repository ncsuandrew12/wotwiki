#### Question

If I were to open a gateway in front of me that opened behind me, and I balefired myself, what would happen?

#### Robert Jordan

Young lady, you are entirely too obsessed and have far too much time. You need to get some sort of life. I suggest you go have an intense love affair. Doesn't matter with who, be it man, woman, or German Shepherd.
