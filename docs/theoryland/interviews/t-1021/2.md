# [Interview #1021: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: The Wheel of Time Retrospective: The Notes, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1021#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I usually do a Q&A session as part of my book signings. One of the questions I get asked most frequently is: "What did you learn from working on the Wheel of Time?" I often struggle to answer; I have no idea how to cover the topic in brief.

I've long wanted to a series of blog posts collecting all of the things I've said at signings, during interviews, and in other blog posts talking about the Wheel of Time experience. I'm going to add to this my thoughts and feelings, and then try to use it all to tackle talking about some of the things I've learned along the way. This will be a multi-day process! So if you're interested in this topic, check back across the next few weeks as I work my way through a retrospective on my involvement in the Wheel of Time.
