". Naturally, someone in the audience called out that they would totally buy that. Of particular interest was the revelation from Tom that the "outrigger novels" that Jordan had long ago planned to do would have been a trilogy about the Seanchan, with Mat and Tuon going back to her homeland to deal with the fallout there. Which is... really interesting. I'm kind of uncertain about it in practice (I would worry about it being anticlimactic, for one thing), but it's an intriguing idea. (I think a comparable situation, though, would be the Empire Trilogy Raymond Feist wrote with Janny Wurts, which could be considered an "outrigger" series to the Riftwar books. And those turned out to be better than the original series, so...)
