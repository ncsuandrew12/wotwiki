#### Leigh Butler

Somewhere in the middle of this amazingness we reached the restaurant, the name of which I am entirely unable to remember. I do remember there appeared to be some type of hoedown going on in the square/park area adjacent, which at least confirmed I wasnâ€™t in New England anymore.

There were about twenty-ish of us at the dinner, only about half of whom I actually met at that point, but the ones I did meet included Matt Hatch of
[Theoryland](http://www.theoryland.com)
, Melissa Craib of
[TarValon.net](http://www.tarvalon.net)
, and most of Jennifer's
~~minions~~
con staff, including Aubree Pham, Rachel Little, and Jakob R. And... um, a lot of other people who I'm sure I met later. I'm sorry, I suck, I know.

Also there, of course, were the guests of honor: the aforementioned Harriet and Tom, editor and bookmaker extraordinaires, respectively. And, of course,
[Brandon Sanderson](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/)
, who finally got to the restaurant after an exciting detour through the completely wrong half of Atlanta, poor man, and was hailed with great relief and general applause from the rest of the party. By chance Brandon ended up sitting next to me, and looked rather uncertain about this until Harriet leaned over and told him that I was the one doing the re-read on Tor.com, though I'm not sure why that revelation would actually
*relax*
anyone. With that in mind, I was actually rather relieved that he seemed only peripherally aware of the blog's existence, though I later warned him that
*The Gathering Storm*
was getting recapped same as all the others, mwhahaha. Yeah, I'm very relaxing. Clearly.
