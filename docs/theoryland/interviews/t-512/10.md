# [Interview #512: JordanCon 2009: The Report of DOOM - Leigh Butler, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=512#10)

#### Leigh Butler

It was either before or after this that I got to meet Maria Simons, who along with Alan Romanczuk were (and are) Jim and Harriet's assistants both editorial and personal, and have been working like gangbusters on Book 12 with Brandon. Maria is about the nicest human alive, just so you know, and she and I would continually run into each other at intervals throughout the weekend so I could continue to enjoy talking to her about everything and nothing. I'm sneaky that way. She is forthwith commanded to get herself up to New York sometime so I can get my Maria Chat Time fix. No arguments, missy!
