For my part, I mostly stood around and ogled people's costumes. There were lots of Aes Sedai outfits, naturally, some of which were stunning in their elaborateness, and most of the men who dressed up chose to be Asha'man, though there was a Cairhienin lord and lady (complete with stripes of rank and foot-high hairdo), a bare-chested guy who had real raven-and-tower Seanchan tattoos (holy crap), another guy who was dressed in an exact replica of the outfit Rand is wearing on the

of
*The Fires of Heaven*
, and my personal favorite, a girl dressed as one of Elayne's Queen's Guards, complete with breastplate, sash, hat and plume. Awesome.

The preponderance of Asha'man costumes led to some interesting (and hilarious) results: Jason (Denzel) hadn't brought a costume either, and elected to simply wear a suit and tie, but in the spirit of things he pinned either lapel with the
[Dedicated sword pin and Asha'man Dragon pin](http://www.badalijewelry.com/jordan_b.htm)
being sold at the con. A little while later he wandered up to me and Trisha and told us in a bemused voice that he had just gotten kudos on his clever costume idea: "A modern-day Asha'man, how original!"

I may have giggled about this, a lot. Ha!

(I wish I had remembered to buy some of Badali's stuff while I was there; I may order something from the
[*Mistborn*](http://www.badalijewelry.com/mistborn.htm)
or
[*Elantris*](http://www.badalijewelry.com/elantris.htm)
collection later. It was really neat.)
