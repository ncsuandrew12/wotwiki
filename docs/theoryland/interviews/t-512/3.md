# [Interview #512: JordanCon 2009: The Report of DOOM - Leigh Butler, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=512#3)

#### Leigh Butler

Anyway, I checked in and then ran into Jason Denzel, the owner and operator and tireless promoter of
[Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com)
, and the one person at this thing (well, almost) whom I had actually met before. I note that his tallness continues unabated. Jason cheerily informed me I had a ride to the pre-con dinner thingy, but only if I was ready in FIVE MINUTES OMG. Have I mentioned I hate La Guardia?
