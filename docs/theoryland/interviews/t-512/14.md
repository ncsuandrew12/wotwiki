# [Interview #512: JordanCon 2009: The Report of DOOM - Leigh Butler, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=512#14)

#### Leigh Butler

Then there was the Team Jordan Panel, which was again Tom, Harriet, Brandon, Alan, Maria, and Wilson, this time talking about the upcoming release of Book 12: what it was like to write it, how much of it was Robert Jordan and how much of it was Brandon Sanderson, and the reasoning behind the decision to split
*A Memory of Light*
into three books, and so on. Most of the latter topic was more than adequately covered in Brandon's
[blog post](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/56/Splitting-AMOL)
, so I won't revisit that, though I will mention that they reassured us that each of the three books contains a Big Ass Ending (my words, not theirs), and has sufficient closure to be satisfying while still carrying forward to the next volume.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was intrigued by Brandon and Harriet's description of the notes and outlines Jordan had left behind, and how they had often had to make decisions where Jordan himself had left multiple options for which way a scene was going to go, and many other interesting details of the writing process. I was generally impressed at how candid and thorough they were about the mechanics of the process without giving away a single detail (that I recall) of the plot itself.
