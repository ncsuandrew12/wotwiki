# [Interview #512: JordanCon 2009: The Report of DOOM - Leigh Butler, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=512#4)

#### Leigh Butler

But, it all turned out well despite my lack of airplane funk removal opportunity. The very next person I met, after a hasty dumping-of-my-crap in my hotel room, was none other than JordanCon Guest of Honor Harriet McDougal, whom I had met once years before (the same time I met Jason, actually) and completely do not blame her for not recalling, because I don't always remember people I work with
*every day*
, and she meets like twenty zillion people a year, give or take a few zillion.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet immediately floored me, though, by telling me she had read
[my blog here on Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/features/series/wot-reread)
and thought it was "wonderful" (her words! I swear!), which left me kind of weebling around mentally for a while. The cessation of said weebling was not helped by the discovery that the jovial-looking gentleman next to her was, in fact,
[Tom Doherty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Doherty)
, who I understand owns some company having to do with books, or something, and has apparently also read and enjoyed the re-read. I'm embarrassed to report that my brain was coming up with phrases like Golly gee! at this juncture, though fortunately I don't think I actually said anything that inane out loud. I hope.
