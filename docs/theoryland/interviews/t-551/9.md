# [Interview #551: SciFi Now Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=551#9)

#### James Rundle

So is
*A Memory Of Light*
still tentatively scheduled for 2011?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's scheduled for next year, yes. I'm going to start working on it in January. One thing that's going to slow me down, though, and I have to warn fans of this, is that it's now been three years since I've read the series straight through. I read it straight through when I started, but it's been three years now, so come January I have to re-read the series. I'm starting to forget things and that's not good, so that'll slow me down by three months or so. My expectation is that it'll push the book back by three months. If I started it in January, I could have it done and out by November, but I just don't feel right about that, so more likely you're going to see it in February.

#### James Rundle

In 2012?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. There's still a chance you'll see it in November, but I have to re-read the series, and I want to take my time with the last one. You'll probably see it in spring 2012.
