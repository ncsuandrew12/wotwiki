# [Interview #529: TWOK Signing Report - Marie Curie, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=529#3)

#### Question

Question: about Mat's use of '
*saidared*
it' in
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that I did that and not Robert Jordan.

#### Audience

I read it and just laughed and laughed for about ten minutes after that...

#### Brandon Sanderson

And you can't tell I'm a student of linguistics? Took several upper level linguistic classes. And I've always loved how language shifts over time, and how the changes happen.

#### Audience

Like 'google' as a verb now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, like google as a verb. This is because there is human nature to start making shortcuts in language. And it tends to happen when people such as Mat are taking shortcuts, as they usually do. And so, that sentence can be read from the linguistics side as this is actually naturally what might start to happen unless someone starts enforcing a certain aspect of the language, or you can read it as Mat being Mat.
