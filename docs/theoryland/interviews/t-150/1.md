#### Orbit Books

With the Wheel of Time now reaching its tenth volume, is it becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all the characters, plot-lines and back-story?

#### Robert Jordan

No, not really. Occasionally I have to look back to see exactly what I said in an earlier book, but the characters, plot-lines and back-story remain clear to me.

#### Orbit Books

Is there a Wheel of Time story-bible locked away somewhere?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. In my head.
