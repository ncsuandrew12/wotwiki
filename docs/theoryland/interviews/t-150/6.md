#### Orbit Books

And on the subject of clues...are you prepared to give anything away from the plot of volume eleven?! Does it have a title yet?

#### Robert Jordan

No, Book Eleven has no title yet. I never have a title until I'm at least halfway through a book, and often not until near the end. As for clues... Read and find out.
