Is this novel going to be a chance for new readers to sample the wonders of the Wheel of Time, or does the reader need some knowledge of the world already?

to be accessible to people with no knowledge of the world at all.

And they will get to see something that I have been asked about fairly often, the test for Aes Sedai.
