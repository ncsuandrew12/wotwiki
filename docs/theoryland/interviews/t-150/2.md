#### Orbit Books

What prompted you to return to the beginning of the story-arc for your next book
*New Spring*
?

#### Robert Jordan

First, Bob Silverberg asked me to do a short piece for an anthology entitle
*Legends*
, and the result was the novella "New Spring". What I first mapped out to write, though, would have been much too long, so I had to revise extensively just to keep it down to novella length. Later, I happened to mention this to my publisher in the States, Tom Doherty of Tor Books, and he asked me whether I could expand the novella to the originally planned novel length. That wasn't really possible, but what I did was rewrite the novella to a considerable extent to make it what I originally wanted. And I was quite right about the length. As a novella, it was a little over 30,000 words. As a novel, the story is about 120,000 words.
