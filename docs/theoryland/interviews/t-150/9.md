#### Orbit Books

And, finally. This is sort of a variation of Desert Island Disks. If you were caught up in a vortex and deposited in the world you have created...

#### Robert Jordan

What sort of evil monster would do that to me, I wonder?

#### Orbit Books

...what three things would you take with you?

#### Robert Jordan

The best "barefoot doctor" manual I could find, the best manual I could find of industrial chemical processes of the 18th and 19th Centuries, and an M-14 rifle with a good scope and as much ammunition as I could carry. The first is for obvious reasons; unless you have access to an Aes Sedai, healthcare depends completely on how good your local Wise Woman is and whether you even have a local Wise Woman. Additionally, the ability to treat injury and illness is a good way to be accepted as a stranger in a strange land. The second would be a source of obtaining an income until I could find my way back here. The third also is for obvious reasons. That world is dangerous, boys and girls!

#### Orbit Books

What would you do in your new home?

#### Robert Jordan

Spend most of my time trying to find a way back out of it. Do you remember the old Chinese curse, 'May you live in interesting times'? Well, that world is much too interesting for comfort.

#### Orbit Books

And which novelist's next book would you most regret not having the chance to read?

#### Robert Jordan

John M. Ford, Arturo Peres-Reverte, Thomas Harris... No, there are just too many to name.
