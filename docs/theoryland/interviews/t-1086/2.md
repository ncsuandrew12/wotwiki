#### QUESTION

A while back someone asked if Hoid's sword is Nightblood, you said that was interesting. Is it similarly Invested?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I'm going to RAFO that. It is a very interesting question.

#### Footnote

Hoid's sword has been proven to not be Nightblood. Nightblood is now in Szeth's possession.
