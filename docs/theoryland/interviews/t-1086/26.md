#### QUESTION

Can someone bond more than one Honorblade?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Honorblade? You can't bond an Honorblade, though it can be given to you. Shardblades, however, come from a spren bond and it is possible to bond more than one.

#### Footnote

Later clarified, Brandon misunderstood the question. One may be bound to multiple Honorblades.
