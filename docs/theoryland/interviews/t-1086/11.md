#### QUESTION

For the Dangerous Women story, are you going to write anything again in that world?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That world will show up again. Silence probably won't, but the world itself, yes. It's called Threnody, it is one of the Cosmere worlds. There's not a Shard there but there are interesting things happening. There's actually been a character in other books who's from Threnody. It will eventually be clear who that is, but they have shown up in many previous Sanderson novels.

#### QUESTION

Would that be Hoid?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Hoid is not from Threnody. Good question though. Hoid is from Yolen.

#### Footnote

Nazh is from Threnody.
