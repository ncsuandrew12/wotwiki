#### Leinton

Can Breath be used to power Surgebinding?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are very similar Investitures, and most of the magics can be powered with the other magics if you are capable of making that happen.

#### Leinton

What would happen to the Breath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Breath would be consumed in the same way that Stormlight is. A renewing resource, much like Atium is.
