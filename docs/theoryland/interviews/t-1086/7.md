#### QUESTION

Where did you get the basis for the spren?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

The spren are partially based out of Shinto mythology, the idea that everything has a soul and a spirit to it. And partially mixing that with my desire to have some sort of a unique representation of emotion in these books.
