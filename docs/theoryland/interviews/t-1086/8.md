#### QUESTION

It seems like a movie adaptation would have just constant spren everywhere?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That's why I made it so that not every use of the emotion causes them-so it wouldn't get too crazy even when I'm writing them. And what's happening is the spren exist on the Cognitive plane, on Shadesmar, so they have to be attracted, they have to be nearby enough to flock to you, so it depends on how common the spren is.
