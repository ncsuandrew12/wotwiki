# [Interview #1086: WoR Signing Report - Talenelat, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1086#5)

#### QUESTION

What about Kaladin getting sliced with the Shardblade and then being able to rejuvenate?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That is a clue for what is going on with Szeth and his understanding of Shardblades and the Shardblade he has.

#### QUESTION

Which is an Honorblade, right?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I can't say, but Szeth says in book one you can't heal a Shardblade wound with Stormlight. There are other very big but subtle discrepancies between what Szeth does and what Kaladin does.

#### Footnote

Szeth has since been confirmed to have and Honorblade.
