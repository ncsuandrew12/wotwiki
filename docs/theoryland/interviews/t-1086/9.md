#### QUESTION

For a Windrunner, if he had enough heating fabrials and enough Stormlight, how high up could he get?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You could exit orbit. Windrunners, remember they're gravitation and pressure. So if he knew what he was doing, we have actually factored how long it would take to get to the various moons.
