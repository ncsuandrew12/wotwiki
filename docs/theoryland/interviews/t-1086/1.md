# [Interview #1086: WoR Signing Report - Talenelat, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1086#1)

#### QUESTION

Are we going to find out in here, why Szeth and what the Truthless are all about?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That, you will have to wait for his flashback sequences in a future book. Each character gets a set of flashback sequences. I'm not going to promise that the characters live to the book where their flashback sequences are. You might have a character die and then get their flashbacks the next book to get more information on them. This will be Shallan's flashback, then the next book will be Szeth's flashback, then Eshonai, then Dalinar.
