# [Interview #275: Robert Jordan's Blog: SORRY ABOUT THIS GUYS, BUT...., Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=275#1)

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think I've ever broken a promise to you guys before, but I must this time. I won't be in Seattle or Anchorage as promised. Harriet finally allowed as how she was just too tired to make the trip, and I guess that freed me up to take a long look at myself. I can see where I am right now, and for all the brave talk, the chances of me actually making it to Anchorage were somewhere between small and nill. Especially if I expected to walk away at the end instead of being carried. So we aren't going to be there.

My apologies.
*Mia culpa, mia culpa, mia maxima culpa*
. Sometimes you just can't deliver. Still, I can't help thinking that getting more back on my feet by the end of June is a better plan.

I am likely to curb my blog posts a bit, too, so don't go worrying over that. They'll be shorter, likely further between for a time, but I'm just trying to get a little rest, that's all. Don't sweat it.

All my best,
  
RJ
