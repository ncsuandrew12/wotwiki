#### Luckers

Could you give us an insight into Jim's writing process? He was clearly quite methodical in his development, but how did he go about it? Were you involved much outside of your role as editor?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

*The Great Hunt*
, we spent a lunchtime discussing how the child of a Maiden of the Spear would be raised. Consider how far ahead that meant he was thinking! Beyond that, he had a magpie approach to the daily newsâ€”I was reading one of his Conans the other day, and was struck by how much it reflects the events in Afghanistan of that time.
