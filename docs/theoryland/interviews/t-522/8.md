#### Luckers

What is your favorite aspect of the series?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The people. And the writing.

#### Luckers

What is your favorite character, and why?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Perrin reminds me of Jim, for as you probably know he was a big man, with 54 inch shoulders.
Mat reminds me of Jim, because he is such a delightful rascal. Rand reminds me of Jim because he is a world changer.

I love them all. I also love Hurin, because he reminds me of Jim's father; Basel Gill, because he keeps a good inn, Thom Merrilin because he is a wonderful storytellerâ€”well, you get the idea. There are about 2,000 named characters, and I love them all. Even Mordeth.

#### Luckers

What is your favorite plot-line, and why?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

That's like asking which child is my favorite!

#### Luckers

Are there any characters you really dislike?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, the villains of darkest dye, of course, but actually (see above) I love them too.
