#### Luckers

I think one of Jim's strongest talents was the writing of strong women, and arguably the strongest is Cadsuaneâ€”and she is also the character that fans seem to either love or hate to great degrees. I'm curious as to your thoughts about her, and her role in the story.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Cadsuane has an important role, for sure; see answer to #10.
