# [Interview #522: Interview With Harriet McDougal by Luckers, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=522#14)

#### Luckers

I have this weird thing about random historical tidbits from the series (like the poisonous peaches, or the six-toed Two Rivers cats), so I was wondering if you have encountered anything like that which you could tell us? Or could you tell us why peaches are now so poisonous?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Peach PITS are poisonous here and now. They're full of—strychnine? Arsenic? I've forgotten which, but they really are bad. The flesh is not. You could look it up. But after one encounter with peach pits, a person would decide the whole thing was poison. This is on a par with the eighteenth century belief that tomatoes were poisonous—some people have an allergic reaction to them.

And in some locations, six-toed cats are common.

#### Footnote

The poison in peach pits is actually cyanide, and RJ commented on the peaches
