#### Luckers

On to the books themselves, I was wondering...knowing Jim as well as you did, were there any plot points or developments in the series in which he truly surprised you? If so could you elaborate on one?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, in editing
*The Eye of the World*
, I asked him something about what would happen once they got to Tar Valon, and he said, "They don't get there in this book, Harriet." He surprised (and delighted) me all the time.

#### Luckers

And were there such surprises (to you) in the layout of the next two books?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Yes there were. RAFO.
