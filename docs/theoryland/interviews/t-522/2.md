# [Interview #522: Interview With Harriet McDougal by Luckers, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=522#2)

#### Luckers

Ok, I suppose I'll start on the job. How did you come to edit for Jim? Did it just fall into place due to your respective jobs, or was it something you had to discuss first?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

It fell into place as follows: When we met I was editing my own imprint, and I gave him his first publishing contract. It was for the Fallon historical novels:
*The Fallon Blood*
,
*The Fallon Pride*
, and
*The Fallon Legacy*
. We worked on
*The Fallon Blood*
all the way through publication before we ever went on a dateâ€”so the editor/writer relationship is the older one. We simply found that we worked very well together.
