# [Interview #88: TPOD Signing Report - Drew Gillmore, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#4)

#### Drew Gillmore

Chris used his moment with the Creator to open himself up to a huge RAFO, but
*his*
question was answered. Chris asked if Moghedien had been raped by Shaidar Haran.

#### Robert Jordan

The answer was "Yes, among other things."...

...Another interesting point that may just be my interpretation of things, is that someone asked if Lanfear had been raped as well, right on top of the Moghedien question, and he answered right away with a "No". It could be any number of explanations, but it seemed to me that it was a given that Cyndane was Lanfear from the context of the conversation.

Like I said, just my interpretation.

Someone else who was paying more attention could fill in here.
