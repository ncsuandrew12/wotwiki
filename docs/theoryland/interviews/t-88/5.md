# [Interview #88: TPOD Signing Report - Drew Gillmore, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#5)

#### Drew Gillmore

I don't remember most of the other questions. A couple of interesting things I do remember, however:

#### Robert Jordan

The first is that the reason
*The Path of Daggers*
seems short is that Jordan could not go any farther without writing a
*whole*
lot more. The stage it seems, is once again set. Another interesting thing was Jordan asking Hawk if she was into leather, and if she was "top, bottom, or switch".

Dirty old man, indeed.
