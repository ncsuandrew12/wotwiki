# [Interview #88: TPOD Signing Report - Drew Gillmore, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#6)

#### Drew Gillmore

The next thing we did was went to the Thai House to drink. Or at least, Darkelf and I drank, with a little bit of sipping done by Eric and Chris. However, Darkelf and I got married (Work
*that*
in, K-J) and consummated the marriage with a pitcher of Stout beer (Thanks, oh Dimly Lit Sprite). I taunted Noell with the thought that Cal would beat UCLA until with four seconds left in the game, I relented and admitted that, in fact, Cal would probably not be coming back.

After that, things
*really*
get fuzzy. We went to Amber, an Indian Restaurant, and had food, and talked. Rick Moen, Rajiv, Phetsy, Paul Ward, and "Justin" showed up. Other people showed up, but they were sitting at the other table and I don't remember all their names. (Someone else is
*really*
going to have to help me out here...anyone make a total list?) Mansur Ward made a cameo.

I had Chicken Vindaloo, that was supposed to be spicier than it was, according to Chris Mullins, but since I was already full of beer I couldn't taste much anyway.

Somewhere in there my ex-fianc√©e showed up(1), and I mentally checked out for the evening. I remember going to Brian's apartment complex for the rec room there, more beer, lots of pool, then a jaunt to Bill and Hawks for an hour or so. At that point I had been up for somewhere near forty hours, and had drank sufficiently enough in my sleep depraved condition to make thinking straight a tricky situation.

I'm not sure how it ended. Badly, one would assume, but you'll have to get that part of the story from someone who A) was there, and B) was \*there\*, if you know what I mean.

1) Don't ask. Weird situation. I'm sure most everyone at the Social is/will be thoroughly confused(2) to find out that she's my ex.

2) About what? Well, that's what you get for not attending.
