# [Interview #88, Entry #2]: TPOD Signing Report - Drew Gillmore](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#2)

#### Drew Gillmore

The first question Chris channeled through me had to do with the female mega-
*sa'angreal*
on Tremalking, and the Seanchan
*damane*
there. We were wondering if the female
*sa'angreal*
would have the same effect on female channelers as the male
*sa'angreal*
in Cairhien had on Rand. Our impression of events was that Rand did not willingly channel into the thing, but that it just pulled the One Power through him.

#### Robert Jordan

Unfortunately, RJ answered the question with a "Yes, if they tried to channel through it." Uh. Okay. Whatever.

#### Footnote

As far as we know, there were never any
*damane*
on Tremalking. After Falme, Suroth took control of the
[smaller islands](http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i111/Terez27/Picture12-6.png?t=1262617429)
not far from Tanchico, but not Tremalking.
*Winter's Heart*
had not yet been released, but when it was, Timna's thoughts did not indicate that the Seanchan had ever been there. Also, RJ seems to be indicating that Rand unconsciously channeled through the
*sa'angreal*
in
*The Great Hunt*
; he hadn't yet consciously tried to channel at all, so this is not surprising, especially considering the way the access key affected Egwene in
*The Shadow Rising*
.
