# [Interview #88: TPOD Signing Report - Drew Gillmore, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#3)

#### Drew Gillmore

My second question was whether or not we would get to see the Battle of Tar Valon or if it would happen "off-screen".

#### Robert Jordan

He opened his mouth, hesitated a second and shot me down with a "Read And Find Out". Bastard.

#### Footnote

Drew was referring to the battle between the two factions of the White Tower, which never happened.
