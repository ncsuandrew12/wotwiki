#### Susan Cohen

The name James Rigney may be unfamiliar to some sci-fi readers, but Robert Jordan will certainly ring a bell. That's the pseudonym Rigney, a Charleston resident, used to craft his epic The Wheel of Time series before his death in 2007. The story lives on, however, thanks to fan and author Brandon Sanderson, who has worked on the final three novels of the series. The most recent volume, and the last in the
*New York Times*
best-selling series,
*A Memory of Light*
, was released this month.
