# [Interview #888: Addlestone Library debuts Wheel of Time collection, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=888#4)

#### Susan Cohen

Greene says the entire collection of material is 50 linear feet long and includes tens of thousands of pieces of paper. The library is working on an organization system and will set up online exhibits that anyone can access, but it may still be a few months before the collection really ready for research purposes (and that's not very long, according to Greene). Right now, the public can visit the special collections section (on the third floor of the Addlestone Library) Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. through mid-February.
