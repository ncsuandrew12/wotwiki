# [Interview #888: Addlestone Library debuts Wheel of Time collection, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=888#5)

#### Harlan Greene

"We have on display right now the first pages of an early draft of the first novel in the series, which is sort of like ground zero for The Wheel of Time," Greene says. "There are lots of interesting PR-related materials and photos of Jim, ephemera that show his humor and generosity, documentation of all the variety of spin-off materials, and copies of the books in over a dozen different languages, as well as the first graphic novel version." And, of course, there are swords.

The library has also set up a blog dedicated to the processing process. Visit
