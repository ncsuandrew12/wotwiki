# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#3)

#### Diomedes

That's really all I have to report from Thursday. Like LitN, I was busy scanning nearby name tags hoping to see a familiar name. Also like John, my powers of deducing a man's outward appearance from his written words is clearly lacking. I'm sure I saw that hat and sunglasses a few times, but failed to notice his name tag. In any case, there really wasn't much opportunity to eavesdrop on anyone else's questions or comments to RJ, since even the front of the line was too far from RJ's signing table to clearly overhear anything.

Friday, of course, was a different affair. For the "Spotlight" on RJ, we were treated to an extended Q&A session.
