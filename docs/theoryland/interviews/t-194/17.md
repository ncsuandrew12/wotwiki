#### Question

Asked how he managed to keep track of all the characters...

#### Robert Jordan

RJ replied, "I'm a genius."

Then he talked about his database of characters which now exceeds 1.5 megabytes, apparently, and that he has them filed by which country they were last seen in. When he needs to use a character for a scene, he finds the ones that are in the geographic location that he needs, and then picks the one that will best suit his purposes from that list.
