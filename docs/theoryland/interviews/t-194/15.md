#### Question

Another question asked about the fighting style of
*Far Dareis Mai*
, and the questioner referenced a particular form of martial art that I had never heard of.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ responded that the Maidens fight with something that could be considered a cross between Tae Kwan Do and a third style that I had never heard of. It's a style that emphasizes the use of feet, legs and hips over the use of the upper body for obvious reasons. RJ felt that an all-female community of fighters would naturally discover such a style since it focuses on a women's relative strengths and would help them overcome their relative weaknesses.
