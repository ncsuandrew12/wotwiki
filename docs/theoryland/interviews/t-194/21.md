# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#21)

#### Robert Jordan

Asked about the sequels to the prequel, RJ reiterated that one would address how Moiraine and Lan managed to arrive in the Two Rivers in the nick of time to rescue Rand and the rest from rampaging Trollocs. He said the other would be about Tam, and how he rose from a simple groom to second in command of the Companions, and why he chose to throw away his successful career to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere.

#### Diomedes

I think the groom bit is a small detail that hasn't been mentioned elsewhere.
