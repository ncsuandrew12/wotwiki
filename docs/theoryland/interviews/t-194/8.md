# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#8)

#### Diomedes

Allowed two questions at the microphone, my second question had to do with "In the Shadow", the prologue of
*The Great Hunt*
. I asked if he had particular characters in mind for all the people that he described, and if so, had he provided clues that would allow us to figure out who those characters were.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ's answer was that he did have some specific characters in mind for some of those people, but not for all of them. He also said that he didn't write the prologue so that it would be easy to deduce who those characters were.

#### Diomedes

Hopefully, this will provide some food for thought, but I believe it is confirmation that the "Shienaran" was not actually Ingtar, as that would seem to obvious in light of this response.

#### Footnote

RJ confirmed on his blog that it was indeed Ingtar.
