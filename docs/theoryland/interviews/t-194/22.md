#### Question

One questioner noted that
*Crossroads of Twilight*
was far more concerned with politics than action, and asked if the rest of the series would follow those same lines.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ assured him that
*Knife of Dreams*
would be considerably different, and said, "You'll be sweating by the time you reach the end of it."
