# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#7)

#### Diomedes

First, I tried to ask shannow's question about how the Forsaken compared to each other in their strength of the Power. Being nervous, of course, I managed to flub that as well by saying, "There's a lot of contradictory information in the books about how the Forsaken are ranked in their strength in the Power. Could you rank the Forsaken more explicitly?" (Or something to that effect.)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ then explained that the Forsaken don't rank themselves in terms of strength in the Power as Aes Sedai do.

#### Diomedes

(Duh! Looks like I used the wrong turn of phrase, or RJ deliberately misinterpreted what I was getting at.)

#### Robert Jordan

He went on to say that the Forsaken do not like to think of themselves as weaker than anyone else, and, due to their arrogance and ambition, will tend to understate others' abilities and overstate their own. He concluded by saying that, given these weaknesses in character that the Forsaken possess, any information that the Forsaken provide should be considered highly suspect.

#### Diomedes

I'm not sure how much this helps, shannow, and I wish that I had phrased the question somewhat differently in light of this response, but I do believe it indicates Rahvin is mistaken when he thinks that he or Sammael are strong enough to take on Lanfear. It's also led me to believe that RJ likes the confusion he's created about how the Forsaken relate to each other in regards to the Power, and he won't easily yield the explicit information that you're looking for.
