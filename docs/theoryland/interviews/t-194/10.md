# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#10)

#### Question

One guy asked whether RJ was disappointed with the "New Spring" novella that appeared in
*Legends*
since he expanded it into a stand-alone novel.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that he wasn't dissatisfied, but that when he originally wrote the novella it was simply too long and had to be cut to fit the anthology. He approached Tor about doing a stand-alone novel, and they agreed, so he was happy to do the full-length novel as it gave him the opportunity to include information that didn't make it into the "New Spring" novella in
*Legends*
.
