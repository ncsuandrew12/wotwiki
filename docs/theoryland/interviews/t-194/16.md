#### Question

RJ was also asked about the replica swords and other artifacts available on the market.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that he had worked closely with Museum Replicas to insure that their creations very close to RJ's vision. He rattled off some of their products; Shienaran swords, Fain's dagger, heron-marked swords and Aes Sedai rings. Apparently the Aes Sedai rings are no longer available, because there were too many other companies producing similar rings. He also said that Museum Replicas intends to let the production line lapse after the sell out of their current stock. And the heron-marked sword is not supposed to be an exact copy of Rand's sword (the one he got from Tam) because the intricate style of Tam's hilt would have made it prohibitively expensive. Nor is it meant to be an exact replica of Lan's sword, which is not heron-marked, but is power wrought.
