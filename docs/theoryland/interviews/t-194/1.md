# [Interview #194, Entry #1]: ComicCon Report - Diomedes](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#1)

#### Diomedes

Freaks, geeks and nerds, oh my! I must say, I felt right at home.

Yes, it's true. LitN and myself were mere feet from one another without ever realizing it. I suppose I should have posted a profile pic, or better yet, been paying closer attention late Wednesday night when John NB me that he would be in San Diego on Thursday. As it was, I didn't get the NB until I was almost ready to leave on Thurs, and thus missed the opportunity to arrange a meeting. Getting to spend some real-life time with someone that I've come to consider a close friend at Wotmania would have made the Comic-Con that much more memorable, and I can only pledge to make more of an effort to work out such a meeting in the future. Perhaps RJ will do a book signing in So Cal after
*Knife of Dreams*
is released.

In any case, it was thrilling to meet RJ in person on Thursday during the autograph session, and I returned to Comic-Con on Friday to witness the Q&A session. I'm a little surprised at how nervous I was in actually asking RJ a few questions. Pounding heart, sweaty palms, a slight shake in the voice, and all that. He's only a guy that writes a few books here and there, right? What's so tough about asking a question or three?

Anyway, on Thursday, I steeled myself enough to ask one question while he signed my hardcover copy of
*New Spring*
.
