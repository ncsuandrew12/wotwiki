# [Interview #194, Entry #2]: ComicCon Report - Diomedes](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#2)

#### Diomedes

If I can remember correctly, I asked, "When a Warder's bond is passed is the original bond still intact or is it broken?"

Not the best choice of words, I admit, but I was nervous. A problem that would repeat itself, unfortunately, the following day.

#### Robert Jordan

In any case, RJ's answer was a terse, "No. It's a transfer. A transfer."

#### Diomedes

Now, I'm sure everyone will have their own interpretation, but I still believe that he's indicating that there is only one bond, and it is passed from one Aes Sedai to another. That is, to extrapolate, Lan is not suffering effects from having his bond with Moiraine broken.
