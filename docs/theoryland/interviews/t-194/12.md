# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#12)

#### Question

There was a question about how RJ felt about having WoT published in other media, specifically the
*New Spring*
comic by the Dabel Brothers and a possible movie.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said he was excited but trepidatious. He described the process by which he was in collaboration with the folks at Dabel Brothers. He understood that certain cuts would need to be made as the story goes from the written medium into others, but wanted to insure that his vision was followed as faithfully as possible.

RJ also indicated that he was confirming even minor details with Dabel Brothers, and one example he used was that the facial bars on a helmet were too thin, and that such bars would be ineffective against a sword swing, that they would crumple and crush the wearer's face, and that the bars were then thickened in the comic book.
