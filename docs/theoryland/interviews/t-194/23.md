#### Question

Finally, one gentleman asked RJ if he felt it was a writer's responsibility to reinvigorate the genre that he's writing in.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said no. A writer's responsibility is create something that is fresh and new. It's his responsibility to provide the reader with surprises. To give the reader the sense that she or he is headed in one direction, only to discover that they end up somewhere else entirely, so that the reader can look back and think, "So that's where you were taking me all along you crafty bastard."

#### Diomedes

This is something that I personally latched on to, because I believe this is really what RJ's writing is about. This is also the reason why I personally have gone so far afield in crafting the hypotheses I have about the direction the story and some characters are headed. Right or wrong my ideas may be, but I feel certain that this story is going to head in directions that none of us have ever suspected before it is finished.
