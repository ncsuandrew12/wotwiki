# [Interview #194: ComicCon Report - Diomedes, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=194#11)

#### Question

Another gentlemen asked about a WoT movie.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that he had a meeting scheduled with Red Eagle that night (Friday night) and the following day (today, Saturday) to discuss that very thing. He hasn't seen any script (perhaps it hasn't even been written yet) and that Red Eagle had an option for
*The Eye of the World*
only. He seemed to have a wait and see attitude about the whole thing, and he provided no definitive information about the how or when a movie would be in the offing. It seemed to me that this is still in the very early stages.
