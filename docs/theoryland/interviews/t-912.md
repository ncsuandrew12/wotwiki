## Summary

## [Entry #1](./t-912/1)

#### Robert Thompson

With his standalone debut novel
*Elantris*
and the current Mistborn trilogy, the second volume (
*The Well of Ascension*
) of which was recently released in August 2007, Brandon Sanderson has established himself as a writer to watch and has become one of my favorite new fantasy authors out there. So securing an interview was always a goal of mine. Unfortunately, Mr. Sanderson has quite the workload, finishing up the Mistborn trilogy, writing a new children's fantasy series that just debuted (
*Alcatraz Versus The Evil Librarians*
—October 1, 2007), working on various other projects (
*Warbreaker*
,
*Dragonsteel*
,
*Scribbler*
, etc.), not to mention the book tour and a new addition to the family :D So, I was extremely grateful that Mr. Sanderson took the time to answer what questions he could and I hope that you'll enjoy the following interview. And for more Q&A fun, be sure to check out

## [Entry #2](./t-912/2)

#### Robert Thompson

In both
*Elantris*
and
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
you pointedly made an effort to defy certain age-old, fantasy clichés. What formulaic story elements did you try to redefine or avoid in the second volume of the Mistborn trilogy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*The Well of Ascension*
I focused on the concept of prophecy. So many fantasy stories involve the idea of an ancient, infallible, and comprehensible prophesy which guides the actions of the characters. In
*The Well of Ascension*
I wanted to show the dangers of relying only on prophecy to provide a guide for your life. I also wanted to turn on its head my own concept of optimism. Many fantasies, including
*Elantris*
, show that If you are just determined enough you will succeed. I wanted to deal with what happens if you believe in yourself and things go wrong anyway.

## [Entry #3](./t-912/3)

#### Robert Thompson

Regarding
*Elantris*
, I read a while back that you had no intentions of writing any sequels, but then you had a change of heart. I know that you've been busy with a lot of other projects, but has there been any progress at all on a possible follow-up, or maybe ideas you could share on an
*Elantris*
sequel that have been bouncing around in your head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I doubt I will do a sequel that begins just after
*Elantris*
ends, at least not with the same characters and in the same place. There are lots of ideas I want to explore in the world of
*Elantris*
, though. I might do something about the Seons, or focus on a different culture, or write about something that happens many years after the story of
*Elantris*
.

## [Entry #4](./t-912/4)

#### Robert Thompson

One of the many projects that you're working on is a new children's fantasy series, book one of which just came out October 1, 2007 via Scholastic Press and is called
*Alcatraz Versus The Evil Librarians*
. Can you give us a rundown on how this idea was conceived, what kind of story readers can expect from it, your plans for the series, and why you chose Scholastic as the publisher?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alcatraz actually started out as a freewrite. In the middle of writing the Mistborn series I needed a break, so I wrote down a silly sentence that had been tumbling around in my head, then just kept writing. It took me 16 days, and I wasn't really setting out to write anything in particular. I ended up with the completely looney first Alcatraz book. I wasn't even sure if it could be marketable, but I sent it to my agent, who suggested some small but significant changes, and then sent it out to children's publishers.

Once I realized it could go somewhere, it fit into my plans quite well. I knew I wanted to start a second series, because it is much easier to make a living as an author if you have two books coming out a year rather than one. I wanted to write something that was different enough from my epic fantasies that my readers wouldn't feel overwhelmed, but similar enough that those who liked my other books would still read it. I decided this meant writing either humor, science fiction, or young adult. I'd actually been reading a lot of YA, and was most excited about that idea, so when we decided to market Alcatraz as middle-grade, I was pleased. I immediately had all kinds of wacky ideas for the series.

## [Entry #5](./t-912/5)

#### Robert Thompson

Moving on, another of your projects is the standalone fantasy novel
*Warbreaker*
. What's cool about this book is that you're offering it as a free download while you're writing it, giving readers the opportunity to witness & provide feedback on the book as it evolves from its roughest stages to eventually, a final version and publication, all in the name of publicity. Personally, I love the concept and just wondered if you had any other innovative ways for authors & publishers to promote books, especially with newer writers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I like the multimedia idea. I've often wondered if offering a CD with a book might be good—an audio book with some of it read by the author, or music inspired by the story, or something like that. I post excerpts of different drafts of my books on my website, and readers, especially those who are aspiring writers themselves, seem to like that. I think there are many kinds of "bonus material" that writers could include with their books in the way of special features that are often included on the DVD versions of movies. This is what I try to do on my website with my annotations and deleted scenes.

## [Entry #6](./t-912/6)

#### Robert Thompson

Cover art is another area that is very important to you and one of the highlights of your books has been the uniquely breathtaking artwork. That trend continues in
*The Well of Ascension*
as artist Jon Foster (
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
) outdoes himself in what I think is the best cover yet. So, just wondering what your thoughts are on how the artwork for
*The Well of Ascension*
turned out, how it stacks up to the other books' covers, and any other thoughts you may have on the topic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really liked Jon Foster's art. I think he captures movement and action well, which was excellent on the Mistborn covers. Foster's covers almost look like stained glass pieces themselves, and with the sort of gothic cathedrals I had in mind for some of the scenes of
*The Well of Ascension*
, this was perfect. As far as my personal opinion, I like the cover of
*Well*
better than that of
*Final Empire*
, but not quite as much as the cover for
*Elantris*
. I have to say, though, that the image they've chosen for Mistborn 3 may make it my favorite cover yet.

## [Entry #7](./t-912/7)

#### Robert Thompson

I believe congratulations are in order :D You have a baby due out soon! How's it feel to almost be a father?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's very exciting and I don't know really what to expect. I just hope he doesn't come while I'm on book tour.

#### Robert Thompson

Let's hope not ;) So do you have any last thoughts or comments that you'd like to share with your readers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Try reading
*Warbreaker*
if you haven't already. My goal is to get better with each book. I hope you stick with me during the process as I figure out what my style is!
