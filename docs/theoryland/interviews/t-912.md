## Summary

## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=912#1)

#### Robert Thompson

With his standalone debut novel
*Elantris*
and the current Mistborn trilogy, the second volume (
*The Well of Ascension*
) of which was recently released in August 2007, Brandon Sanderson has established himself as a writer to watch and has become one of my favorite new fantasy authors out there. So securing an interview was always a goal of mine. Unfortunately, Mr. Sanderson has quite the workload, finishing up the Mistborn trilogy, writing a new children's fantasy series that just debuted (
*Alcatraz Versus The Evil Librarians
—October 1, 2007), working on various other projects (
*Warbreaker*
,
*Dragonsteel*
,
*Scribbler*
, etc.), not to mention the book tour and a new addition to the family :D So, I was extremely grateful that Mr. Sanderson took the time to answer what questions he could and I hope that you'll enjoy the following interview. And for more Q&A fun, be sure to check out

#### Robert Thompson

In both
*Elantris*
and
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
you pointedly made an effort to defy certain age-old, fantasy clichés. What formulaic story elements did you try to redefine or avoid in the second volume of the Mistborn trilogy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*The Well of Ascension*
I focused on the concept of prophecy. So many fantasy stories involve the idea of an ancient, infallible, and comprehensible prophesy which guides the actions of the characters. In
*The Well of Ascension*
I wanted to show the dangers of relying only on prophecy to provide a guide for your life. I also wanted to turn on its head my own concept of optimism. Many fantasies, including
*Elantris*
, show that If you are just determined enough you will succeed. I wanted to deal with what happens if you believe in yourself and things go wrong anyway.
