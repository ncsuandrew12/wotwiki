# [Interview #290: Robert Jordan's Blog: Some more thank yous, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=290#1)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Dear all: Most sincere thanks from Robert Jordan (via Harriet) go out to

Michael J. Fredericks, Jean Verney-Carron, Evan Harmon, Lisa Kirwood, Ryan Salsamendi, Emma de Laat (hello, Emma!), David Freeman, Helena Taylor and Janet Taylor

for gifts to the Mao Hematologic Malignancies Programâ€”amyloidosis research. Thank you one and all.

Jim is taking it easy today, since we go up to the Mayo tomorrow for a routine workup -- but as a consolation prize, here is a poem of mine:

> Bard: n., a full set of equine armor.
>
> Your head seethes with essential magic,
>   
> its glittering chanfron deep and wise,
>   
> high-buffed, strong in dream and reason.
>   
> and your escutcheon shining pure.
>   
> The crinet of your glistening neck,
>   
> articulated, burnished,
>   
> glides swiftly to the brazen peytral
>   
> of your great roomy chest.
>   
> On it emblazoned script in gothic flame:
>   
> Live in today, live for tomorrow.
>   
> Your flanchards bearing you in strength,
>   
> shine bright below your gleaming crupper.
>   
> And for your groin: festooned galloons,
>   
> fine textiles in a nest, and heavy gold.
>   
> All worlds flare in your burning eyes,
>   
> as soul and words bring fat new flames
>   
> to the pale page, and to my greedy heart.

Hope you enjoy it. You have all been a wonderful support for both of us.... I guess this is a little thank-you token. Best, Harriet
