## [Entry #1](./t-537/1)

#### Matt Hatch

My son (he's ten and wore his Theoryland t-shirt) and I went down to Brandon's signing at the Orem, UT library this evening. I have the audio of the general Q&A with the audience, but nothing specific to anything WoT related, so I'm not going to transcribe that right now.

After the speech and Q&A, we waited for the line of those waiting for their books to be signed to end. I didn't come with a list of questions, but I figured I couldn't leave without asking a couple. So, here are the few I asked—two are ones I came up with regarding two recently discussed theories and the rest were submitted by fans via @Theoryland on Twitter.

Short and sweet.

## [Entry #2](./t-537/2)

#### Matt Hatch

(General summarization of the attack on Rand) Moridin is speaking to the Chosen. He’s kind of pissed. He’s saying look somebody, it was either Sammael or someone pretending to be Sammael, but it was definitely one of the Chosen. Is Moridin’s assumption/belief correct, that the only way for that to have occurred was for one of the Chosen to be involved?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone very high up would have to have been involved.

#### Matt Hatch

(Laughter) I should have phrased the question differently…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone very high up would have to have been involved. It didn’t just happen.

#### Matt Hatch

When you say high up, do you mean marked or someone with great power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone with great influence and power among the, the um…the, among those who follow the Shadow would have to have been involved.

#### Matt Hatch

(Laughter) So, are you suggesting that it may not have been just one person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I said what I said (smiles).

#### Matt Hatch

(Sorry Terez—made up these questions on the fly, so they weren’t very good, but it’s something to chew on. Next.)

## [Entry #3](./t-537/3)

#### Matt Hatch

This has to do with the Luckers’ Shiny Dragon theory. Masema mentions having a vision, someone tells him to kill Perrin. So, my question, was the individual telling him to kill Perrin a male or female?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He saw a male.

#### Matt Hatch

He did, but was the individual a male or a female?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs appreciatively and pauses)

Yes, yes he was a male or a female.

#### Matt Hatch

(Laughs) Was the individual a male?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Thoughtful, deep intake of breath, pause)

#### Matt Hatch

…as classically defined by his physical…(laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Says, yes I get what you are asking)…

#### Matt Hatch

...I’ll say it this way, does this individual have the soul of a man or a woman?

#### Brandon Sanderson

mmmhmm. (pauses looking up for a good twenty or thirty seconds)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Female.

#### Matt Hatch

Excellent.

## [Entry #4](./t-537/4)

#### Matt Hatch

The other question I had…someone wants to know if you are ever coming up to Ontario, Canada?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We did have a Canadian Con invite me. 2012? (Asks his wife) I would really like to do a Canadian tour next fall, since I don’t have a tour scheduled, since there are no books coming out next fall. So I might try to do a Canadian tour next fall.

## [Entry #5](./t-537/5)

#### Matt Hatch

(for WSB): The next question is from a Theorylander. Did Ishamael’s healing of Lews Therin back in the prologue of
*The Eye of the World*
create the same doctor-patient bond as when Nynaeve healed Egwene?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, not that I know. I think that I would know, but no.

## [Entry #6](./t-537/6)

#### Matt Hatch

The last question…Mitchell asks, can we expect an epic Rand/Elayne/Aviendha/Min reunion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m so glad you said reunion.

(Small group of people erupt in laughter)

#### Matt Hatch

You were wondering where I was going with that... (More laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. Ask again later.
