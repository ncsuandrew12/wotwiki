# [Interview #946: AMOL Signing Report - KJacobs, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=946#2)

#### KJacobs

I managed to get in one question of my own: Do we know how many total letters Verin wrote, and did they all reach their intended destinations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon smiled, and of course said, "Well,
*I*
know, but
*you*
don't." :) I immediately rephrased to 'Will we know?', to which he responded that yes, all of the letters were delivered, and he believed that further details were forthcoming in the Encyclopedia.
