#### KJacobs

Had a great time yesterday at the signing in Milford NH!

@Wetlandernw—Fantastic job on the crossword—not easy by any stretch, and some really interesting clues. It was obvious that you put a lot of work into it, so thank you for all of your efforts! I even managed to win one of the awesome WOT backpacks with my single raffle ticket that I earned by answering one of the trivia questions taken from the puzzle. :)

—thanks for posting—we weren't able to hear all three of your questions, so I had been wondering what we missed!
