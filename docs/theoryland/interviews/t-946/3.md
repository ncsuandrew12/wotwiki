# [Interview #946, Entry #3]: AMOL Signing Report - KJacobs](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=946#3)

#### KJacobs

The evening ran very lateâ€”the event was scheduled from 2:00-5:00 and the signing portion started at 3:00; we made it through the line around 6:15, and there must have been at least 50-60 people still waiting behind us. The theater could seat 460, and I estimate that the crowd reached somewhere in the neighborhood of 375-400. Poor Brandon was definitely feeling under the weather, and his voice was pretty rough, but he was incredibly warm & gracious with his time regardless. My husband got some nice pictures, but I can't quite figure out how to post them into the thread. :(

All in all, a very memorable day!
