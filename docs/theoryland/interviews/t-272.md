...here are a couple of me, one with the dragon do-rag and one without. Liese Corrigan is coming by this afternoon to take some pics, and I'm pretty sure there will be something better among them. Ugly customer, isn't he!

#### Jason Denzel

Personally, I don't think it's THAT bad. The new look reminds me of somebody, but I can't quite put my finger on it. (Maybe James Cromwell)? Hmm. Maybe not. It'll come to me later I'm sure.
