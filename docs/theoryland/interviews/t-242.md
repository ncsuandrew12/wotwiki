## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#1)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Just got back from the book signing in San Jose. Got to meet Frenzy and Jason from Dragonmount. Both very nice people in person. Frenzy isn't as scary as she would like you to think although I refrained from discussing Asmodean with her as she is the Faction Champion of the Apathy for Asmodean faction.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#2)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Yes Isabel I handed RJ your letter and 63 page dissertation on Asmodean. I told him that Isabel says hi and that she asked me to deliver this to him since she was grounded and couldn't make it.

#### Robert Jordan

He made a note on the front letter at the top and underlined it "Grounded".

#### Jason Wolfbrother

I begged him not to kill the messenger and he did notice my shirt, "You? No!" but did not comment.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#3)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Frenzy had some friends that took our picture with RJ and we got our books signed. The Q&A was pretty much nonexistent as there were a lot of people waiting to have books signed. However, I stuck around til the line thinned out and was able to ask 11 questions and get 10 answers and a RAFO.

So here goes, the questions I asked and the answers RJ gave. Note these are not direct quotes (I didn't have a tape recorder), but I wrote down his answer as he said it. Most are short answers, only a couple were more than a few sentence explanations.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#4)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Was the "Don't Kill Rand" order ever lifted between
*Lord of Chaos*
and
*Knife of Dreams*
, or was it always in effect?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, for a short while.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#5)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Does it take a lot of concentration, strength and effort to weave inverted/reversed weaves?

#### Robert Jordan

Not easy but not difficult either. Just need to learn the trick.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Can everyone, no matter how weak they are, use inverted weaves?

#### Robert Jordan

Anyone can do it once he/she learns the trick.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#6)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Can you shield dreams for someone else?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#7)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Was
*Callandor*
constructed during the War of Power?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Was it used in the War of Power?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, that is how the flaw was discovered.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Why didn't they ward/buffer
*Callandor*
?

#### Robert Jordan

The flaw with
*Callandor*
is simply a manufacturing flaw. He went on to talk about how they were at the end of their tech age with only a few sho-wings and jo-cars left. A couple of shocklances were still around but they were not as prevalent as they had been. Anyway they had been mass producing
*ter'angreal*
,
*angreal*
, and
*sa'angreal*
, and there are bound to be flaws with the products. The flaw with
*Callandor*
is simply one such flaw.

#### Footnote

This is specifically referring to the lack of a buffer.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#8)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

What is the second most powerful
*sa'angreal*
for men? Will it make an appearance?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

I should clarify this. RJ said that many misinterpret RAFO. When he says RAFO, all he is saying is that the information might already be in the book and you need to read more carefully, or that it might be something he wants to use at a future point and doesn't want to give away at this point in time. It does not mean that it will show up later for certain. People are making assumptions and guesses and adding things to what RAFO actually means.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#9)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Is "Second Captain" of the Illianer Companions held by only one person at a time, aka The Second Captain?

#### Robert Jordan

One person. Only one Second Captain and he is the second in command.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#10)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Can a channeler fly without any
*ter'angreal*
or equipment (like sho-wings) if he or she knows the right weave?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Flat out, no hesitation, no thinking. Simply put, NO.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Is it possible to for two channelers to lift each other simultaneously so that they can hover, and "fly" that way? Because he answered the previous question as he did I did not ask this one as it is obviously, to me at least a 'No' also.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#11)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Bonus question: Since there was still time and he was still sitting, I decided to chance a second RAFO and ask my question.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#12)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Is the One Power finite or infinite?

#### Robert Jordan

He sat and thought for a minute, still signing the book, pondered, then answered.

The One Power is finite but cannot be used up. When the weave is done, it returns to the Source. The way he put is was finite but infinitely reusable.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#13)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

He was very nice and friendly. He wasn't personalizing any of the signings though since there were so many people. There were a couple of people dressed as Whitecloaks. RJ saw them when they came up, "not my favorite people, but the costumes look good".

I tried to catch some questions others asked while having their books signed but didn't hear any that were relevant to the plot of WoT.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#14)

#### Robert Jordan

Their will possibly two or three "outrigger" novels if he can get the right stories. He has to kick the ideas around for a few years to be sure the story is worth telling. He doesn't want to write in this universe simply to be writing in this universe.
