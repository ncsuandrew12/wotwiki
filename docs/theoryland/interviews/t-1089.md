## [Entry #1](./t-1089/1)

#### PrncRny

What connection is there between Lifeless and Shard-severed limbs?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

They are similar, but different. With Lifeless it's due to the soul being drained away, shrinking to nearly nothing. With Shard-severed limbs, that portion of the soul is sheared clean away.

## [Entry #2](./t-1089/2)

#### PrncRny

Can any Oathgate go to any of the 11 locations?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

As far as they are aware, the gates can only go to Urithiru.

#### Footnote

The "they" in question refers to the characters in the book.

## [Entry #3](./t-1089/3)

#### PrncRny

So Alethi hair "breeds true" based on the individual's ancestry, why then does Renarin have more black than Adolin?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

As with us regular people, different shades of skin can be had within the same family with the same parents, its just a matter of how their DNA falls out. No different here. Nothing special with Adolin and Renarin's hair.

## [Entry #4](./t-1089/4)

#### PrncRny

Why is Breath not consumed in Awakening, unlike most all other uses of Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Not all investitures are "used up." Must like energy, it isn't typically created or destroyed, just changes form. With Breath, in what it's used for, it is just more easily and readily recovered than in other forms

#### Footnote

According to PrncRny the answer was a bit beyond his understanding of the cosmere, he may have not gotten the specifics but he tried to give the jist of the answer.

## [Entry #5](./t-1089/5)

#### PrncRny

How and when is the type of Misting you become determined? Can you tell what type of Misting you are before you Snap?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It's determined at birth. The cosmere by combining 3 aspects of self. Your physical self, mental self, and spiritual self. The spiritual self is tied to the Investiture of the world that you come from. When an Allomancer snaps, a piece of their soul is broken and some of that power leaks into them, giving them their abilities.
