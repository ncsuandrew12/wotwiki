# [Interview #84: TPOD Signing Report - Aaron Bergman, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=84#2)

#### Aaron Bergman

Anyways, after scaring the people around me for a little bit, I went up to the books and decided to ask Jordan about Asmodean. In particular, I asked whether "death" was just a pun on "Moridin".

#### Robert Jordan

He said "oh, god no" quite disgustedly. This made me feel much better and should hopefully put the issue to rest. He also said that by the end of this book, it should be obvious who killed Asmodean and that it is definitely possible to figure it out the instant he dies.
