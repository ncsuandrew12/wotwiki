# [Interview #84: TPOD Signing Report - Aaron Bergman, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=84#1)

#### Aaron Bergman

Brief NY and Social Signing Report

Well, the book signing was mobbed. There were well over 150 seats and people were standing. It was strictly controlled with people going to have books signed one row at a time. This, of course, left little time for conversation.

I was seated next to three random people who happened to have lurked on the group. I also had a copy of the FAQ with me that two people recognized. So, perhaps the great lurker hordes do exist.
