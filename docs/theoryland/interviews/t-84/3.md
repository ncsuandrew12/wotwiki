# [Interview #84, Entry #3]: TPOD Signing Report - Aaron Bergman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=84#3)

#### Aaron Bergman

That was all I was able to ask. A group of us then walked over and chatted with Tom Doherty and someone named Linda (?) at Tor. PNH wasn't there as far as I could tell.

We then went down to the cafe and finally found Bradj bringing the group to me, Nathan L, Burr, Becky Slitt, Dennis Higbee, bradj and two people whose name I forget. Nathan had to leave to get back to Boston and the rest of us ate dinner at a brewpub across the street. Someone else can summarize this, I suppose.

We later left.

That's it. I did say brief.

Aaron
