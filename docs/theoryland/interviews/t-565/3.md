# [Interview #565: TOM Signing Report - Hanover, MD Tower Guards, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=565#3)

#### Renee

The evening started with a reading by Harriet from the prologue of
*Towers of Midnight*
. We were given the choice of hearing a section from Lan’s point of view or Padan Fain’s, though it wasn't much of a competition when it came time to raise our hands and vote. For the next quarter hour we listened as Harriet read about Fain’s trek north into the Blight, sometimes laughing and sometimes nodding our heads thoughtfully as she read the passage with a slight southern drawl. Once Harriet was finished, Brandon stepped up to the podium and proceeded to answer questions posed by those in the audience for another twenty minutes, covering topics ranging from the Mistborn series to future works within the Wheel of Time universe after
*A Memory of Light*
is complete.
