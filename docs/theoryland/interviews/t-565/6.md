# [Interview #565: TOM Signing Report - Hanover, MD Tower Guards, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=565#6)

#### Renee

All too soon I’m on my way home, after a few precious moments getting to talk one on one with Harriet and Brandon about the books they’ve been a part of writing.

#### Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal Rigney

I asked a single question each of the duo, receiving a RAFO response from Brandon when I asked if we ever get to see Shara, and finally solving the mystery of how, exactly, to pronounce Cairhien from Harriet.

#### A group wolf howl and several goodbyes later, I find myself driving back down Route 50, and this late at night I am the only car on the road. I have left the other Tower Guard to go our separate directions, forging a lone path of light through the darkness as I travel east and north to await the Last Battle. Until then, my friends, may you always find water and shade. —Renee, Tower Guard 11/05/2010
