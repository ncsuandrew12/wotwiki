# [Interview #565: TOM Signing Report - Hanover, MD Tower Guards, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=565#2)

#### Renee

When I arrive there is already a crowd of people waiting to make petitions to the Amyrlin and her Keeper of the Chronicles, but there is a while yet before they will arrive and so I do my best to see that everyone is kept happy along with the other Tower Guard. During my talks with some, I find that they have come from cities as far away as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and in the case of one gentleman, London, England. They are all excited to be here, however, and are as pleased as I was to make the journey if it meant getting the opportunity to have an audience with Harriet and Brandon. After a short delay—planes will simply never be as reliable as Traveling—the two arrived to much applause and got right down to business.
