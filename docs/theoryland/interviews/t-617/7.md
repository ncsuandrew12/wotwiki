#### SciFi Bulgaria

The Wheel of Time fans couldn't have expected a better author for the last three books of the series. Do you plan to finish the prequel trilogy which Robert Jordan (may his soul rest in peace) began with the novel
*New Spring*
once you are done with The Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Whether the other prequels get written is up to Harriet, Robert Jordan's widow and editor. Currently it doesn't look like it is going to happen; we feel that letting
*A Memory of Light*
be the final Wheel of Time book that appears will be a sign of respect for Robert Jordan. In the case that Harriet does eventually feel the prequels are necessary, I will write them, but it would not be anytime soon.
