#### SciFi Bulgaria

Would you tell something to your Bulgarian fans?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm very excited to have books being released in Bulgaria. It is an honor that people are willing to look at my fiction and give me a chance. I really do appreciate all of you out there reading my books and supporting me, and so I thank you very much. Any time you have questions, please feel free to email me through my website. I like to be available.
