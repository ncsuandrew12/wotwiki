#### SciFi Bulgaria

Having in mind the success of the Mistborn series, can we expect another book with the same characters or in the same world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The story of Vin and Elend is complete, and I'm very happy with what I was able to do in the end of
*The Hero of Ages*
. But the Mistborn world still has many tales to offer. There's a new Mistborn book,
*The Alloy of Law*
, coming out in November, that follows events three hundred years after the original trilogy. It's a bit different, but I hope readers enjoy it.
