#### SciFi Bulgaria

What kind of literature do you prefer to read in your spare time and what is your favourite book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Reading fantasy is what got me into writing fantasy, and that's still what I prefer to read. But I do like novels and nonfiction in some other genres—
*Les Misérables*
is one of my favorite books of all time; I think Victor Hugo was a genius. But there are many authors from whom I'll love one book and not be as blown away by their other novels. Here's a sampling of single books I think are fantastic:
*A Fire Upon the Deep*
by Vernor Vinge,
*Dragonsbane*
by Barbara Hambly,
*Tigana*
by Guy Gavriel Kay, and
*Sabriel*
by Garth Nix.
