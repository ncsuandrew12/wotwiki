#### SciFi Bulgaria

SciFi.bg speaks with a world-known writer. The creator of Mistborn tells his Bulgarian fans more about himself and his work.

Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy writer of top class. He's relatively young for his fameâ€”only 36 years old, he's already known for his Mistborn book series. The word of his success reached Harriet McDougal, the wife and editor of the late Roberd Jordan, author of the Wheel of Time book series. His widow chose Sanderson to finish the work of Jordan. In 2009 Sanderson announced that he accepts the challenge and will finish the saga in three additional books, but will remain faithful to the plans of the original author. Two are already on the market and the last book has yet to come.

SciFi.bg spoke with the writer and told him that he has many fans in Bulgaria. Brandon himself, as a fan of the genre, knows how they feel and decided to please his readers with an interview, where he'd thank them, reveal more about himself and his future projects.

We're releasing the original text of the interview due to the high interest from Brandon Sanderson's fans abroad.
