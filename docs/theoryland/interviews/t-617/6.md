#### SciFi Bulgaria

Is there a motion picture or TV series in the works based on one of your books/series and if not are you open to the idea of making one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think excellent movies or TV series could be made from many of my ideas. Dreamworks Animation optioned my
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
books a couple of years ago, but they eventually decided the project wasn't right for animation. Mistborn has been optioned by Paloppa Pictures, and there are several other properties of mine currently being looked at by Hollywood. I don't know if an adaptation will ever eventually reach the screen, but I would welcome the opportunity for my stories to reach a wider audience.
