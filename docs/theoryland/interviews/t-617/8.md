# [Interview #617: SciFi Bulgaria Interview, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=617#8)

#### SciFi Bulgaria

How's the writing of
*A Memory of Light*
coming along? Can you tell us something more about it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm currently at the 34% mark on the first draft, and I plan to finish the draft before I go on tour in November for the release of
*The Alloy of Law*
. At that point the book will go into the editing stage, which will take several months. Harriet wants to make sure we take enough time polishing this book so it isn't released with a lot of mistakes, and I agree with this choice. This is the final book; it has to be done right.
