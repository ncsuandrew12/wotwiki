# [Interview #617: SciFi Bulgaria Interview, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=617#10)

#### SciFi Bulgaria

How much do you know about Bulgaria? Do you plan on paying us a visit in the future?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would love to visit Bulgaria in the future. I'll admit that my knowledge is somewhat lacking. My own studies in college focused on Asia, so I'm quite familiar with Asian languages and societiesâ€”I lived in Korea for two years and got a minor in Korean&mdsahbut I've never studied your region of the world and don't really know much about it at all. But I'm eager to visit. I've recently been trying to get to more places, specifically in Europe, and adding new locations to my tour dates. So maybe I'll eventually be able to make it.
