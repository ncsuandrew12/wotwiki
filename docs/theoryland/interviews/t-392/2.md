#### Brandon Sanderson

In other news, progress on the Wheel of Time continues at a good clip. It's been a surreal, incredible year working on one of my favorite book series of all time. It still feels odd to think of myself as a fifteen year old boy, reading the beginning of Rand's story and wondering how it would end. And now I get to write that ending, or at least part of it. You may have noticed that I hit my 400,000 word goal for
*A Memory of Light*
. So, for you Wheel of Time fans, here is an updated relative lengths chart. Think of it as my Christmas present to you.
*A Memory of Light*
is now officially the longest book in the Wheel of Time Series.
