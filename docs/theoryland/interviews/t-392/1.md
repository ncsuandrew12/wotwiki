# [Interview #392: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas!, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=392#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd just like to stop and thank everyone for making this year such an awesome one. Despite the tough economic times, I ended up with a
*New York Times*
bestselling novel, and that still kind of blows my mind. You can actually see that they've put it on the paperback cover of
*Mistborn: The Hero of Ages*
. (Or, at least, you'd be able to see it if it weren't so small. The fine folks at Tor haven't sent me an official image of this yet, so I had to steal this one from Amazon.)

And, since I'm in a picture posting mood, you may be curious to see these below. You see, Drew delivered my copies of the Mistborn minis the other day. And, of course, Pemberly promptly took them and had them invade the snow village she has up on the top of our cabinets. This is why it's great to be married to a gal like her.

As a reminder, Drew sells the minis alone or in sets. They are of pewter, and come either with a display patina or hand painted. My personal favorites are the painted koloss or the pewter patina finished Vin. (And, she should probably be on TOP of the library in the photos above . . . ) Grab yourself a set with holiday money so that next year, you can invade your friends and family's snow villages with your own Mistborn or Koloss infiltrators. ;)
