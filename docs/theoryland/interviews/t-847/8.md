# [Interview #847: Melbourne SupaNova 2012 - Q&A Podcast with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=847#8)

#### Question

I recently finished reading
*The Alloy of Law*
, which was a fantastic book by the way...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you.

#### Question

...but I noticed towards the end you started creating overtones of a much larger story, and I was curious how you are going to follow up on that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will do more books without
*Alloy of Law*
, with Wax and Wayne. I originally—I may have said this in the forward to Alloy of Law—I pitched the Mistborn series a three-book, as three sets of trilogies, past-present-future, and I do still intend to do that, but I am going to pick up some of the things that I did in
*Alloy of Law*
and keep going with those same characters for a little longer, the main reason being I really like how
*Alloy of Law*
balances Stormlight Archive. I love big epics, but I also love fast-paced kind of actiony books as well, and being able to do a little bit of both of that fulfills both sort of itches, scratches them both, and so I like having
*Alloy-of-Law*
-style books come out alongside larger epics.

So I will be—to answer the questions that are coming—next is the last Wheel of Time book, and pretty much everything I have is devoted to that book. I'm hoping to have revisions of that done by the end of June, and then can start on Stormlight 2 which is what I will do next. The Wheel of Time book is coming out in January. I had really hoped to have it out in November, but it proved unrealistic, and I'm too optimistic on these things sometimes, and Harriet wisely counseled that we need to slow down a bit and spend some more time on the revisions, which we are doing. The Stormlight book, if I'm really on the ball, will be next November-ish—not this one but a year from that—and then I would follow it really closely with another
*Alloy of Law*
book.
