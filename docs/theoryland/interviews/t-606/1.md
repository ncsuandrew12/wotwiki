# [Interview #606: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Gemmell Award Nominations + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=606#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The short list of six nominees for the David Gemmell Legend Award is out, and for the second year in a row I have two books on the list.
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*The Way of Kings*
join Brent Weeks's
[*The Black Prism*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316075558?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
, Pierre Pevel's
[*The Alchemist in the Shadows*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1616143657?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
, Peter V. Brett's
[*The Desert Spear*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0007276168?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
, and Markus Heitz's
[*The War of the Dwarves*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1841495735?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
.

Once again I'm honored to have two books nominated for the award named for David Gemmell, as he was such a fantastic author. (My favorite of Mr. Gemmell's titles is
[*Knights of Dark Renown*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/034537908X?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
.) Because this is a reader-voted award, that means you all took the time to stop by and give my books a nominating vote. That means a lot to me. Thank you so much!

I do find it amusing that I've now managed to lose the award more times than it's been offered. But did you know that the winner gets a battleaxe?

I definitely want to hang that battleaxe on my wall one of these days, but as always there's stiff competition from a set of very worthy nominees. All of these books deserve a read.

You can vote for the 2011 David Gemmell Legend Award

. If you already voted earlier in the year and are wondering what happened to your vote then, that's how the field was narrowed down to these six finalists. All vote totals were reset when the short list was announced, so you should vote again if you have a preference on what book wins. (Voting for the 2011
