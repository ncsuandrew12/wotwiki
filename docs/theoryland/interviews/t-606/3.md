# [Interview #606, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Gemmell Award Nominations + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=606#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a couple episodes of Writing Excuses up that I have not yet mentioned. First Dan, Howard, and I did another brainstorming episode covering
[urban fantasy](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/05/01/)
. Then at Penguicon, Howard and I sat down to record an episode with Nebula and Campbell nominee
[Saladin Ahmed](http://www.saladinahmed.com/)
to talk about
[non-traditional settings](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/05/08/)
. Check them out.

Things are mostly working on my website after its recent server move—the
[library](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/)
,
[annotation](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/)
, and
[store](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/)
pages are all accessible and functioning—but there's still some work to be done in the site's backend. The upshot is that I can't yet add new annotations or library items. So the
[*Warbreaker*
annotations](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/book/Warbreaker)
are on hiatus until that gets fixed, as are the
[*Warbreaker*
html chapters](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/catalog/Warbreaker_Full-Books)
, and the expanded "I Hate Dragons" short will also have a delayed posting in the library.
