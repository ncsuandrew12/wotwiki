# [Interview #606, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Gemmell Award Nominations + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=606#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In other award news, this past weekend I went to the
[Whitney Awards](http://whitneyawards.com/wordpress/)
ceremony at the
[LDStorymakers](http://ldstorymakers.com/)
conference.
*The Way of Kings*
won the Best Speculative Fiction award, and it also tied with Dan Wells's
*Mr. Monster*
for Novel of the Year. I'm happy the book has been so well received, and sharing an award with Dan is awesome. (See the following links for a complete listing of the

and
