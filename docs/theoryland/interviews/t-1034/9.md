#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Does mechanical Feruchemy draw from the user or the machine?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Let's see if I can phrase this correctly. Feruchemy— I don't want you to guess everything I'm going to do, then the books won't be interesting for you in the future— When I'm approaching using them mechanically I'm trying to keep to the core principles of the magic as much as possible.
