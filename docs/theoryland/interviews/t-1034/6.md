# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#6)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Once the technology is appropriately caught up and once I feel like it's right. It's going to be a little while.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

We've actually had a conversation on the forums about using Lurchers and Coinshots in a way to power a train of sorts. It has inspired some interesting conversations.
