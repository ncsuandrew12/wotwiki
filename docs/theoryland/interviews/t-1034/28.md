# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#28)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

And the last one we have here is: Is it possible to use a soulstamp to give shardplate life or at least achieve a robotic status?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, it is really, really hard to invest things that have already been invested. Let's just say that, it is really hard to do that. Part of the reason why it is difficult for instance to Push or Pull on something that is inside of somebody because the investiture is interfering and you would have that similar problem doing anything to shardplate with any of the magics.
