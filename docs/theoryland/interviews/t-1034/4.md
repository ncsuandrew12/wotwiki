# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#4)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Are there any eventual plans for release of things like
*Way of Kings Prime*
or the old version of
*Dragonsteel*
after the new version is released?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Once there are no more spoilers in those books I'll do what I have done with things like
*White Sand*
and whatnot, that if people write me—
*Mistborn Prime*
is a good example. There's no real spoilers in
*Mistborn Prime*
if you've read the trilogy. It's not a very good book but you can read it and kind of understand the history of where the story came from. So I'll do the same thing with those books.
