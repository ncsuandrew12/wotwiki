# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#8)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

This, I'm unsure of what exactly is being talked about because I have not been reading the forum: What happens when a Pulser is burning Cadmium and in a speed bubble? She'd be burning her Cadmium 20x faster than usual--so far as her bubble and those in it were concerned - and her slow bubble would extend far outside the area made "normal" by the effects of the speed bubble, so where does all that extra energy go?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um... Send me that one in writing and let me run it through Peter who is my physicist.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

We'll do that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And maybe run the math through Eric. He's probably asking that one.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

That was actually - I think it was Windrunner on the forum. I might be wrong I think that's who it was though.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's supposed to ask me the hard
*Way of Kings*
questions, not the hard Mistborn questions.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Yah, we've got a couple of those a little farther down here but most of these are mostly clarification.

#### Footnote

This question was actually posed by Kurkistan on the 17th Shard Forums.
