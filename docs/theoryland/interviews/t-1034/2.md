#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Next one we have is on a similar note: When you reach the end of the cosmere will there be something else? Or do you feel this will take most of your writing career to achieve?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yah, I think this kind of the Story of my writing career. Now, who knows. As I plotted it - right around mid-Mistborn series time - I came out with thirty-six books, of which I've done what five or six? More than that...

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Three, four, five, six, seven...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Seven. I think there is plenty of time so ask me in thirty years.
