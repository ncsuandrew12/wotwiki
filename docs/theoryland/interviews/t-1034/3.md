#### Brandon Sanderson

That's really a "ask me in thirty years" sort of thing. I want to see if I can't get this whole thing done. I want to do it in—There's this sort of tension to it, in that I view this as—The arc is my life's work. But at the same time I don't want to be belaboring it. There are cool things going on that I want to get to and I want to tell people about. And so there's this push and pull inside of me, wanting to do this. We will see.
