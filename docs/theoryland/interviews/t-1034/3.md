#### Chris King (Miyabi)

This one's kind of similar: When or if you reach the end of that, were you planning on expanding more or were you going to get done with what you had planned and be done with it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's really a "ask me in thirty years" sort of thing. I want to see if I can't get this whole thing done. I want to do it in—There's this sort of tension to it, in that I view this as—The arc is my life's work. But at the same time I don't want to be belaboring it. There are cool things going on that I want to get to and I want to tell people about. And so there's this push and pull inside of me, wanting to do this. We will see.
