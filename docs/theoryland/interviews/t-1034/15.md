#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Is Resealing a subset of Forging, or a separate system like Bloodsealing is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um… I'm trying to remember what I decided—I was building all of this on a fourteen hour plane flight keep in mind—I believe it is… Let's go ahead and PAFO that one. I need to go to my notes. I can give you a tentative "I believe it is the same system and not a cousin system" but at the end of the day I kind of had to go to my notes and work things out. There was lots of wiggle room built into the Elantris magic system but I have to know what I decided.
