#### Chris King (Miyabi)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When the Aonic peoples discovered Elantris… did seons exist… Okay let me go back to my timeline... It kind of means you have to define what you mean by Aonic. The problem is if you dig back too far in history it's kind of like asking "What’s a German?" You know what I mean?

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Because the Aons are based upon Elantris itself and so they don't become Aonic until they are writing the Aons.

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, no, that’s getting, okay— Let's go ahead and RAFO that one, just because the history of Elantris is very interesting to the cosmere. When people are starting to get an inkling of that.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Odium was there once upon a time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yah… And the question of who built Elantris and how they built Elantris. What's going on with the Elantrians back then and things like this. So let’s just RAFO that.
