#### Chris King (Miyabi)

What are some characteristics of and how many other wordhoppers are there that we have seen excluding Hoid, Demoux, and Galladon.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You gave me really good wiggle room on that one. Obviously the other person with Galladon and Demoux.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Right, the one from a future book.

#### Brandon Sanderson

His characteristics are… What is he like? Some people have read his book so they know what he's like…

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Which book is he from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's from
*White Sand*
.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Okay, that's one I have but have not gotten to.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's only mediocre so don't worry about it. Let's see what other worldhoppers I want to give you clues about… There’s a Terriswoman running around, if you keep your eyes open.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

I have to read it, everything.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Who else do I want to talk about…
*Words of Radiance*
has a couple good ones, that will be pretty obvious.

#### Footnote

The Terriswoman worldhopper was later revealed to be in
*Warbreaker*
though her identity is still unknown.
