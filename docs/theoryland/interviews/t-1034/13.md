# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#13)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Now we are going to move more to some questions on Sel: Would it be easy for a Forger who'd once almost lost her arm (freak guillotine accident) to make a stamp to lose it temporarily, or would it require some more involved Forging than "my arm actually got cut off that one time"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, andâ€” The more plausible something is the easier the Forging is definitely.

#### Footnote

The tone of this answer was a "No, it would be easy for her to do it", the phrasing is ambiguous without the audio
