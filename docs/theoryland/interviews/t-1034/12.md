# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#12)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

This is the last one here we have from Mistborn: Did the Lord Ruler use lerasium to gain his super Allomantic abilities or did he grant that to himself with the Well's power? If he used the bead, does he count as one of the nine original Allomancers that Sazed mentions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excellent question. He did not use the bead. In all of this he granted himself basically, he rebuilt himself to be extremely powerful and he did not use one of the beads.
