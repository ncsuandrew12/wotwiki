# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#20)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

We only have one here from Nalthis, this one's a little bit tricky. Can you store Breath in metal without the Eighth Heightening? Just put it there without Awakening, just to hide the Breath.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Can you hide Breathâ€¦ Yes you can hide Breath in things.

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Metal in particular, without the Eighth Heightening.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say yes you could.

#### Footnote

The ability to awaken stone and metal is actually a feature of the Ninth Heightening, not the Eighth as Chris and Brandon discuss here.
