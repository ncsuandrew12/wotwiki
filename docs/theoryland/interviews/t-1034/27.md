# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#27)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Two more questions here: Do bigger gems store more stormlight for longer than smaller gems? So a broam would hold it for twenty hours where a chip might hold it for six hours or something.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The cut of the gem and how flawless the gem is has more to do with how long the stormlight stays than size.
