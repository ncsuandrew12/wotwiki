# [Interview #1034: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi), Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#24)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

And this is one of my side theories that I espouse here. Is that kind of similar to the reason why there are no spren in Shinovar is because the people there so disbelieve them that it creates a negative pressure that keeps them from physical manifestation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question.
