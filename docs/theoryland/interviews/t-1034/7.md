# [Interview #1034, Entry #7]: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Chris King (Miyabi)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#7)

#### Chris King (Miyabi)

Will Southern Scadrians have their own series? Or will they just be something mentioned in the next Mistborn trilogies? Does anything major take place?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We will have to see. Originally they did not have a series but it will depend on how much time I spend deviating with interesting side-stories before I jump up into the second trilogy. Because by the second trilogy, this has all been discovered and it's a different world. I have loosely plotted a smaller series visiting the southern continent.
