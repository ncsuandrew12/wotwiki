#### Terez

Why didn't the bond protect Bryne's dreams?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why didn't the bond protect Bryne's dreams!

#### Terez

The Warder Bond...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes! Um....(pauses to think)

#### Terez

Is it an active thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What's that?

#### Terez

Is it an active thing, like...she has to....Moiraine kind of phrased it like it wasn't...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. No, no no.

#### Terez

...like,
*because*
of the bond, he's protected.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. (long pause) Why don't I MAFO this one so I don't say it wrong, because I had to go to Maria on this one.

#### Terez

Right. Yeah, okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

...if that makes sense. And so, I will tell you wrong. I will MAFO it, because it's one I had to talk to her about. So we'll go back to the source of me being...or me working these things out in the first place.

#### Terez

Okay.
