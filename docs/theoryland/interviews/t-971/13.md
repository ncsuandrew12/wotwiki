# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#13)

#### Terez

Fain says that the thinning of reality around Shayol Ghul would make it easier for him to anchor himself there, and Dom wants to know if the proximity of the Tower of Ghenjei had anything to do with the fate of Aridhol.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I honestly don't know. That would make logical sense...

#### Terez

Yeah, it would...

#### Brandon Sanderson

But...we could look in the notes. That's one I suspect is not in there.

#### Terez

Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But you can say there's a good chance that's the sort of thing that would make sense...

#### Terez

Yeah, okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question.
