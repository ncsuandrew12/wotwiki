# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#27)

#### Terez

Was it actually Egwene talking to Rand, after...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I've left this one intentionally ambiguous.

#### Terez

I figured that's what you did.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That, and whether Lan actually died or not, are both ones that I'm not going to answer.

#### Terez

Yeah, and whether Perrin actually died or not, because he's in the dark prophecy too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but do remember that the dark prophecy people are misinterpreting that one a little bit, by intention.

#### Terez

Yeah... [Amusingly, Brandon is talking about the dark prophecy in
*Towers of Midnight*
, and I'm talking about the one in
*The Great Hunt*
.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, they're supposed to misinterpret it, but one of the lines doesn't refer to Perrin; it refers to Hopper, and then the next line...

#### Terez

Well, not her new lover!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah...

#### Terez

That's not Hopper, is it? (laughter behind)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, no...

#### Terez

She's not into...okay. Good. (laughs)
