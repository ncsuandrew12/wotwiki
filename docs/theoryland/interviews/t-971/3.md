# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#3)

#### Terez

There were no personalizations the first time through because they wanted to get Harriet out of there. I did manage to ask her a question, though (paraphrased):

#### Question

What did RJ like to read (fiction or non-fiction) on the Civil War?

#### Harriet McDougal

He read non-fiction, no fiction.

#### Terez

Not even
*Gone With the Wind*
?

#### Harriet McDougal

No.

#### Terez

So nothing in particular?

#### Harriet McDougal

No, I can't remember anything in particular.

#### Terez

I know he liked Jane Austen from that general period...

#### Harriet McDougal

(big smile) Yes, he did.

#### Terez

The line was long, and she had someone else, so I had to leave it there. I didn't realize until later that Jane Austen died well before the Civil War began; I wasn't sure exactly when she lived.
