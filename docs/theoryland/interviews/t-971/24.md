#### Terez

Alright, is Cadsuane's lesson to the Asha'man yet to come?

#### Brandon Sanderson

To the Asha'man? It is the same lesson that Rand learned, but they....they
*started*
to learn it.....

#### Terez

Yeah...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that they have not completely learned it yet. Not until they have spent years...um...growing...

#### Terez

Well the distinction in Min's viewing is that none of them would like learning it from Cadsuane.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Mmmhmm.

#### Terez

Yeah, so that's where everybody gets a little bit confused.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Terez

But yeah, I got you.
