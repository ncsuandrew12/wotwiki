# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#1)

#### Terez

This was the last ever WoT book tour stop, and a lot of people came out. There were about 250 people there altogether. April and Chip were there as Cadsuane and Warder, along with some other JordanCon folk I don't know so well. Jeff and Kiley Daniel of Ta'veren Tees were also there, and Randy Word (a nice guy who goes to JordanCon) was there with his wife Ashley and his brother, Brandon. Brandon is also a nice guy and he friended me on Facebook after the signing, but then I started an argument with him about gun control (I couldn't help it!) and he unfriended me. (I'm sure this surprises no one.)
