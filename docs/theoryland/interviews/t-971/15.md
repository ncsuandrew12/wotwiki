# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#15)

#### Terez

Um, was there any connection between Mat's luck and the dagger?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, not that I know of. Good question, but we can MAFO that one, but you can give the, "not that I know of". I'm still kind of...you know, the Mat's luck being beyond him being
*ta'veren*
, is one that's very interesting to me, because everything that I know says that his luck does extend beyond his
*ta'veren*
ness, but...

#### Terez

Well, it's like his whole plotline seems kinda designed as like this revenge story for Manetheren against Aridhol, you know?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, uh-huh. Yep.

#### Terez

And, you know, he starts speaking the Old Tongue
*right*
before they go into Shadar Logoth; that's the first time he speaks it...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh-huh. Yep.

#### Terez

...you know, and then as soon as he wakes up from the Healing, he's got memories, he's got this luck, you know?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Mmmhmm.

#### Terez

So...yeah.
