# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#17)

#### Terez

About—if you can estimate—how many Aiel were in the Town?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, boy. I think there is an estimate in the notes.

#### Terez

There is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, so ask Maria, and if I say it, I will get it wrong because Jim has an estimate of how many Sightblinders were going to be in the Last Battle.

#### Terez

Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And that would include, you know, ones born there and ones captured, and...yeah.
