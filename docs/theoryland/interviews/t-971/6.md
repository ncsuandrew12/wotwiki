# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#6)

#### Terez

At this point, Brandon started signing my books. I recorded the conversation while he was doing it, so from here on out it's transcribed. I always ask for something unique, but this time around bossman
[insisted](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#6)
the HCFFs should ask for a unique personalization—probably because Brandalization kind of decreases the value of signed books!—so Brandon took it as a matter of course. I asked for Zombie's infamous love pentagram.

(start transcript)

....you have to draw a pentagram....and then, you know, you can start with Moiraine on one tip, and then just follow it around, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh-huh. Okay, yeah, that is...I do remember that. Okay. So.... (draws two lines) Can I even draw a pentagram?

#### Terez

Now, they go up to the middle...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, now they go up like this...

#### Terez

...right...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...like that, and then across.

#### Terez

(laughs) Yes. It's perfect.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And then Thom...

#### Terez

No, nonononono! Because, like, Moiraine connects to Thom here...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, it goes like that! I see what it is...

#### Terez

Right, right. Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I see.

#### Terez

And then Thom connects to...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...to Morgase.

#### Terez

Right.

#### Jennifer Liang

Is this like the hook-up quadrilateral?

#### Terez

It's a love pentagram. (laughs)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, and then Morgase is
*not*
going to be Tallanvor....

#### Terez

Gareth...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Morgase is going to be Gareth Bryne, and then Bryne is going to be Siuan....

#### Terez

And then...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Siuan and Moiraine, pillow-friends! Right, yeah....

#### Terez

...and then Siuan comes back to Moiraine! Yeah!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah, okay.

#### Terez

It works perfectly.

#### Jennifer Liang

Yeah, the Wheel of Time is basically one big hook-up chain. (laughter)

#### Terez

Well, I thought this was special, cause it's like...it's not a love triangle; it's a love pentagram.

#### Jennifer Liang

Yep.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, okay. Again, sorry for my handwriting.

#### Terez

And then you have to draw a heart.

#### Brandon Sanderson

(draws heart and sparklies)

#### Terez

(laughs) That's great. Now for the questions!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, now for the questions.

#### Terez

Alright.
