# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#8)

#### Terez

Now, are Graendal's actions in Shara mentioned at all in "River of Souls"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't think we talk about them.

#### Terez

I was just curious as to how that interacted... (crosstalk)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I mean, I considered...Yeah, it certainly helped with what he was doing.

#### Terez

Right, right.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But I mean...yeah. It's...

#### Terez

Because she totally didn't know he was there, so....

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. It certainly helped, and if I had been able to go back, and do—which I wouldn't have done—but if, you can imagine, there's a very cool interaction there, where he's there, and she's doing stuff, and he's taking advantage of it, but she's not seeing him and things like that. Like, the whole Demandred In Shara thing is awesome, because there's like twelve books worth of coolness of him being the hero...

#### Terez

Because all this stuff is in the notes, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What's that? Oh, some of it is, not all of it.

#### Terez

Oh, well yeah, because I know you said you had to kind of....you know, extrapolate a little bit...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had to extrapolate a lot of the Sharan culture and things, which is where "River of Souls" came from. At the end of the day, because I was extrapolating these things, that's what made them distracting from the main plotline, if that makes sense.

#### Terez

Mmm, yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And so, a lot of what I was doing was like, it you know...all of Demandred's flunkies. Jim didn't name those; they're not in the notes...but I put them in because, you know, we have to evoke this entire two years of awesomeness....

#### Terez

Yeah, it can't just come out of nowhere, and be nothing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, so there's that. But yeah, it was too much me, also.

#### Terez

Yeah...gotcha.
