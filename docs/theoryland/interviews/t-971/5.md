# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#5)

#### Terez

Then Kiley had a question. She's very soft-spoken so I'm not sure I got it all down right.

#### Kiley Daniel

So how much, either consciously or unconsciously, do the diary entries from the Lord Ruler reflect the Rand-type characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's the pitch to myself for Mistborn, years ago: "What if Rand failed, and decided to take over the world instead?" basically. It's more than that, though; it's, you know" "What if Frodo kept the ring? What if the hero from the monomyth failed, and instead became the tyrant?" And so, I consciously evoked that.

#### Kiley Daniel

So did you ever see in that through the end, so that Rand didn't go....like, this is really similar, ever?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not specifically, but you know, I was basing the idea off of that, yeah.

#### Kiley Daniel

It was like, "This could be Rand's diary," you know.
