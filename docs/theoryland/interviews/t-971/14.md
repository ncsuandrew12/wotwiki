#### Terez

Um...did you notice...(in a louder voice)...has everybody standing around me read the book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, spoiler! Just warning you.

#### Terez

Spoilers! Okay, did you notice any good foreshadowings for Egwene's death aside from Guinevere and the Year of the Four Amyrlins?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um...(laughs, looks at Jenn)....those are very good. I mean, it's mostly, you know, the Guinevere myth and things like that, but there's...(to Jenn)...there's others, aren't there?

#### Terez

The Year of the Four Amyrlins is the only, like, really nice one that I've latched on to, you know? Because it's like, she's talking about, "It's almost like now..." and it's like, "Everybody came to grief in the end...." And it's like...yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmmhmm.

#### Terez

(laughs)
