# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#23)

#### Terez

The name...how do you pronounce it? Is it no-tay, or no-tie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, it's...you pronounce the K.

#### Terez

Oh, you pronounce the K!

#### Brandon Sanderson

....according to Alan, who is the Old Tongue expert, who corrected me on it even though I named him.

#### Terez

So say it!

#### Brandon Sanderson

k'no-tie. But Alan can correct me, because Alan is the expert.

#### Terez

Does it have any mythological basis that you know of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it does not that I know of, because that one, as most of the names—not all of them, but most of them that I named, because I named him—came from me writing something in English, and saying, "Alan, give me the Old Tongue."

#### Terez

Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And so, there are times where he'll find something, and I'll be like, "Oh, that sounds like this! Let's use it. Oh, this sounds like this; let's use it." Most of the time, it's...he comes up with the direct translation.

#### Terez

Like, Shaisam, actually...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Terez

Yeah, I mean that's easy to figure out for us, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And there are some where I say, "Let's find something that feels like this..." and then, you know, of course, Perrin's hammer, right?

#### Terez

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's one where you're like, you know, let's find an Old Tongue translation that works for what the mythological symbolism is.

#### Terez

And that works well. It's hard to pronounce though.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it is a little hard to pronounce though.

#### Terez

Can you pronounce it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

MAH-HAHL-in-ear? Eh...ask Alan.

#### Terez

(laughs) Okay.
