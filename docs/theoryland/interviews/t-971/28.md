#### Terez

Was Min's "three ships sailing" inspired by the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa María?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't believe so. Wow, but I don't know, so I can't say on that one...

#### Terez

Oh, it wasn't yours?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, no....ah...

#### Terez

It was in the last book: three ships sailing, insect in the darkness, red lights....

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. It's not the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa María....

#### Terez

Yeah, well I thought it might have been
*inspired*
by that...

#### Brandon Sanderson

We'll have to dig into the notes on that one.

#### Terez

Allllll-right.
