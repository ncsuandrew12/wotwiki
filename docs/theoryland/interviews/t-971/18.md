# [Interview #971: AMOL Signing Report - Terez, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=971#18)

#### Terez

The next one is something that somebody
[asked for me](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=916#2)
—on my behalf—before, but did Perrin bind his soul to the
*hammer*
? Or...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Did Perrin bind his soul to the hammer? That's an interesting question. Why are they asking this?

#### Terez

Because I asked before, was it Hopper? It's because of what Slayer said about his ability to step in and out....

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, was based on having two souls in one body...

#### Terez

Yeah, and he said, "It's just like you," right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmmhmm.

#### Terez

You know, so it has to be something.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it's a good question. (with an air of finality) That's a very good question.

#### Terez

(sighs loudly) (people around laugh)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say...how about this: I would say the relationship between Perrin and Hopper is...part of the reason that...Hopper may not...have suffered as dire a fate...(crosstalk)

#### Terez

*That*
's what I was hoping for...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...as wolves would normally suffer when killed where Hopper was killed. How about that?

#### Terez

Yeah, that's what I was hoping for, but your answer to the last one kind of drew me on the path of the hammer, which was somebody else's idea, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmmhmm.

#### Terez

But yeah. Good!

#### Brandon Sanderson

So there you go.

#### Terez

That makes me happy.

#### Footnote

*A Memory of Light*
, Chapter 45, "Tendrils of Mist".
