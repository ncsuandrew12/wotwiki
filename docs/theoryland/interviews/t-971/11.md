#### Terez

Was the Shadow able to track down or intercept any of Verin's letters after she died?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um...(laughs)...

#### Terez

You can answer that vaguely if you want.

#### Brandon Sanderson

....(laughs, coughs)...I'm (ahem) really good at answering things vaguely, but I can say that at least one of them did not find its mark.

#### Terez

Okay. That's good.
