# [Interview #47, Entry #1]: LOC Signing Report - Eric C. Piquette](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=47#1)

#### Eric C. Piquette

I went to the signing last Friday down by the coast and thought I'd give a small report. I got there about 5 min. before 6:00, and not many people were there yet. I was #11. RJ was late, so in the meantime there was a discussion about WoT. Most of the the discussion centered on this group. Myself, Julie Kangas, and a couple other rasfwrj-ers explained to non-net fans about the group and about information gleaned from previous signings. (btw, if MIGHTY MORGNO was truly looking for other net readers, I fear he suffered from the rare malady of "can't see the forest for the trees.")
