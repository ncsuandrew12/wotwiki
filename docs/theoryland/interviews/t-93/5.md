# [Interview #93: Sense of Wonder Interview, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=93#5)

#### Sense of Wonder

You are a strong support of literacy programs, such as Reading is Fundamental (RIF), and your novels have been praised by the American Library Association, VOYA (Voice of Youth Advocates) and
*Library Journal*
. Do you hope your work will be used to further literacy?

#### Robert Jordan

I hope so, and I also hope that people will occasionally think about "the right thing to do," about right behavior and wrong, after reading one of my books. I don't try to tell them what is right or wrong, only to make them think and consider. But primarily, I am a storyteller, and the job of a storyteller is to entertain. In the case of the Wheel of Time, I tell a story about ordinary people pushed into extraordinary events and forced to grow and change whether they want to or not, sometime in ways they never expected.
