# [Interview #269, Entry #2]: Robert Jordan's Blog: Pictures of Wilson from RJ](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=269#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Here are a couple of pictures of my Cousin Wilson which I would appreciate you posting. He is as close to me as a brother, and in fact has always been called the fourth of the three Rigney brothers. He is also the first to come through with the promise to shave his head when my hair fell out. In fact, he didn't wait. When I had my hair clippered, he had his shaved.
