# [Interview #302: Robert Jordan's Blog: HI, THERE, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=302#8)

#### Robert Jordan

For Doug Hall, thank you for your service. For Cindy Oberschlake, I know the area where you father was killed, but I never met him. I'm afraid that he died before I reached 'Nam.

For Kathy, I'm afraid I didn't know your father. Sorry.
