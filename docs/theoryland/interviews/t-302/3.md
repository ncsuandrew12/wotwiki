# [Interview #302, Entry #3]: Robert Jordan's Blog: HI, THERE](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=302#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For Dr. J.W. Stubbe, I am on pulse therapy with the dexamethazone, lowering the exposure, and the docs here are watching everything. I have developed pregnazone (SP?) skin, where the skin becomes thin and fragile, easily bruised and easily torn, but I guess it can't all be good beer and hot chili.

#### Footnote

RJ is referring to prednisone, a steroid that typically isn't administered for long periods of time because of this and other problems.
