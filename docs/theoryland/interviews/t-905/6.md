# [Interview #905: Brandon Sanderson Talks Fantasy & Film, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=905#6)

#### Helen O'Hara

Are there bits in it where you were aware that it felt like your writing rather than him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there are some. For example, Robert Jordan was a Vietnam veteran: he'd been in real battle. My battle training has been watching cinema and reading great books. So my perspective on fight scenes is very different from his. I can't get that authenticity 100%, and if I try too hard it's going to feel fake. I have to do the action sequences like I do action sequences. So it'll flow like cinema rather than having the chaos and insanity of real battle.
