# [Interview #905: Brandon Sanderson Talks Fantasy & Film, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=905#2)

#### Helen O'Hara

So, since we usually only interview filmmakers, is there any big-screen news to share?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wish I had more film news. The Mistborn trilogy's been optioned, and I really like the producers and they have a screenplay, but that's the big step, you know, going from producers with a screenplay to getting a studio. Wheel Of Time has also been bought, not optioned, by Universal Pictures, so they're in the screenwriting stage right now.
