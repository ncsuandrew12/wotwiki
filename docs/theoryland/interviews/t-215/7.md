# [Interview #215: KOD Signing Report - NaClH2O, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=215#7)

#### Question

The next question was "How do you keep track of all the characters?"

#### Robert Jordan

He talked about his files, and said that he doesn't start out with huge files, just the basic outlines, but as the story grew so did the files and now he has a huge file database. He said that he is going to take these files and make an encyclopedia out of them. (He did not mention Harriet as being the author.) He talked a bit about the encyclopedia, saying it will include every invented term, character, place etc. It will also include a 1000 word Old Tongue dictionary. The same questioner then asked about the raw files and RJ said he wouldn't publish those, but he may give them to a university, "maybe my own".
