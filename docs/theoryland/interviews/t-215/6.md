#### Question

The next question was about the mechanics of his writing.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that when he first started writing, he wrote longhand on a tablet and transposed it onto a typewriter. Eventually he graduated to an IBM Selectric which he called the "Cadillac of typewriters". His first computer was an Apple III and he then went to a Mac but all the software was incompatible and he swore off Apple products. He doesn't like Apple it was obvious. He then talked about early computers, and waxed prosaically about how much easier computers, even the very old ones, made writing.
