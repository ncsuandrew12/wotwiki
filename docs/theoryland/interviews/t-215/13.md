# [Interview #215: KOD Signing Report - NaClH2O, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=215#13)

#### NaClH2O

When I finally got up to the desk I asked, "After Moghedien was mindtrapped, Moridin said that had she not managed to do some good by accident, she would have been dead. What good was Moridin referring to?"

#### Robert Jordan

His answer, "I RAFO'd that on the blog".

#### NaClH2O

So the three direct questions I asked him all got RAFO'd.
