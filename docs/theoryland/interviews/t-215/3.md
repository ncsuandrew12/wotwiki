# [Interview #215: KOD Signing Report - NaClH2O, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=215#3)

#### Question

Somebody then asked how he kept up his interest over the long haul.

#### Robert Jordan

He answered that he has been writing WoT for over 21 years, and that his work day remains the same: Reads the newspaper at breakfast; goes to his study (which isn't in the house it seems) answers necessary e-mails and phone calls, and then starts writing. He's supposed to take a break for lunch, but sometimes that isn't until 3 or so. Around six he goes back into the house and helps Harriet get dinner together. He does this 7 days a week. Occasionally he'll take a day off for golf or fishing but then mentioned that he's been golfing once and fishing twice. He then said that one of the things that keeps him interested is the growth of the characters.
