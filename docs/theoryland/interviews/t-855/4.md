#### Brandon Sanderson

My pal Larry Correia, author of the Monster Hunter International series, is running a kickstarter for a MHI
[world book/tabletop roleplaying game](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/herogames/the-monster-hunter-international-employees-handboo)
. The kickstarter is actually already funded, but it looks cool. If you like shooting monsters with accurately described guns, this might be for you.

The most recent Writing Excuses episode is another live episode recorded at GenCon Indy. We spoke with James L Sutter about writing
[tie-in fantasy fiction](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/10/21/)
. He's the co-creator of the Pathfinder RPG system and is the editor of all Pathfinder fiction, so if you've ever been interested in writing in a universe like that, check it out!
