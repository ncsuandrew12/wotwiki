#### Brandon Sanderson

Some of you want to know how to get signed copies of my other books. If a book has been out for a year, I sell signed hardcovers in my
[store](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/1/)
. (
*The Alloy of Law*
isn't up there yet, but it will go up next week.) Many readers like buying signed copies to give as Christmas gifts, so here's the skinny on the holiday shipping deadlines this year. My assistant Becky says that all international orders need to be in by November 12th at 5 p.m. MST, and all domestic orders need to be in by December 5th at 5 p.m. MST. I will still sign book orders that come in after those dates, but the likelihood of a delivery by December 24th goes way down.
