# [Interview #855, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: EMPEROR'S SOUL signing-by-mail, AMoL audiobook promo, Holiday shipping deadline + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=855#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This post will be another run-down of a bunch of different topics.

Weller Book Works is once again handling a signing-by-mail for one of my releases. In this case, since
*The Emperor's Soul*
is already out in bookstores, it's going to run slightly differently. They are limiting it to 200 copies, and I'll be signing and numbering them the same day I do my in-store signing there, November 6th. They're also experimenting with cheaper shipping this time around (the book is a trade paperback and much smaller than my usual, which helps), and I hear that the email they sent out to people who ordered previous books says all orders must be done via email to books@wellerbookworks.com. And a note for those of you waiting on ebooks: the ebook will come out toward the beginning of November. Anyone who orders the print version can get a free copy of the ebook (as soon as my assistant Peter makes it) following the routine we used for the
*Legion*
ebook.
