## [Entry #1](./t-177/1)

#### Lady Voldemort

I just got back from seeing RJ around an hour ago. Sorry, Isabela, I didn't see your post until just now. Anyways, I got overly excited and I could barely even ask my question. Yeah...so anyways, my question was:

## [Entry #2](./t-177/2)

#### Lady Voldemort

Is it possible for an Aes Sedai to bond someone Asha'man style?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, if they learned the weaves. The Asha'man know a lot more about bonding than the Aes Sedai. Some guy figured out how to bond their wives, and then they started concentrating on other things they could do with the bond. The Aes Sedai never experimented, just passed on what they knew.
