A word from Jason:

A lot of you are probably more than a little bummed about this, but look on the bright side: we know that Robert Jordan is taking his time to write the best book possible. We've already waited about two years, so an extra two months should not make a huge difference. It just means you won't have one under your Christmas Tree, right?. I don't know about you, but I'm willing to wait that time if it means the book will be that much better.
