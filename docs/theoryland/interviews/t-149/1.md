# [Interview #149, Entry #1]: RJ: Letter to Fans on the Delay of COT](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=149#1)

#### Dragonmount

Amazon.com now lists
*Crossroads of Twilight*
as having a January 7, 2003 release date. Originally it was set to be released on November 12, 2002, but it has been pushed back at Robert Jordan's request.

Tor books was the first to confirm to us that it has been delayed because Robert Jordan wants to make sure he has enough time to make it just right. They would not comment on the exact release date yet.
