# [Interview #1070: WoR Signing Report - Leinton, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1070#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I also asked him about capitalization. He talked about how in modern English, capitalization is boring and doesn't happen often enough, referring back to the Victorian era where they would just capitalize Important Words. I asked him about parshmen vs Parshendi and he said that the Parshendi were a nation. I also asked about skaa vs Noble but he didn't answer (I think he just forgot or missed it, I worded it with lots of unnecessary words and people are loud) but it would be safe to assume a similar reason.
