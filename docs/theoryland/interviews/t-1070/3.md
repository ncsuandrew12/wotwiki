# [Interview #1070: WoR Signing Report - Leinton, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1070#3)

#### Leinton

Is Shadesmar just a name for the Cognitive Realm or is there a difference?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The answer he gave me was a little confusing but he clarified it by saying that it was like San Diego was a part of the United States but the United States wasnâ€™t a part of San Diego. I asked if this meant that Shadesmar was a location in the Cognitive Realm and he said yes.
