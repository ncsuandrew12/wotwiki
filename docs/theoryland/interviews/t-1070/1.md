# [Interview #1070: WoR Signing Report - Leinton, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1070#1)

#### Leinton

So I didn't get to ask many questions but the ones I did get answered I'll post here. All are paraphrased because I had no recording equipment. Also I was expecting large numbers of RAFOs and didnâ€™t get them. Also there are no spoilers for Words of Radiance in this, so feel free to read!
