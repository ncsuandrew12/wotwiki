# [Interview #1059: Sci-Fi Bulletin Interview: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1059#4)

#### Paul Simpson

Are there themes you don't yet feel you can tackle for whatever reason?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are indeed. There are things I've shied away from—more because I haven't found the right character voice that I would want to tackle them with yet—things that are very far removed from my own experience. Writing a transgendered person, for instance, is something that is so far removed and so different from what I've done, that it's something that I've intentionally not tackled. If I find the right character, the right story, and the right resources, then perhaps I'll tackle it. But writing the other, someone who is very different from yourself, is not something to approach lightly. I don't think it's something that you should absolutely avoid, or absolutely be afraid of, because otherwise some voices are just not going to get as much visibility as they probably deserve. But I might be the wrong person to do it, or it might just be the wrong time in my life.
