## [Entry #1](./t-689/1)

#### Question

What’s your favorite fantasy/scf characters that you haven’t written?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excluding my books and the wheel of time, Sam Vimes from the Discworld books, I really, really like. I have a strong affection for Harry Dresden. I really am fond of Lesa from
*Dragon Riders. Dragon Riders*
was one of the early books that I really really liked. Let’s see, who else. That guy from
*Dragon Prince. Dragon Prince*
is one of my favorite all-time books. Who else? Who else is good characters? The Fool from the Assassin books by Robin Hobb that she wrote is really awesome. That’s a good place for you. I would like to say Kvothe, because I love those books, but I don’t think he and I wouldn’t get along. I love the books and think that Kvothe is a jerk, and that’s part of why I love
*Name of the Wind*
, because Kvothe is kind of a jerk.

## [Entry #2](./t-689/2)

#### Question

So what happens if you have a Bendalloy bubble, and then another Bendalloy bubble inside of it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will compound and double, and it will multiply. Bendalloy is one of the metals from
*Alloy of Law*
if you haven’t read it, as this person obviously has, or has read the Ars Arcanum, you’ll find out what it does.

## [Entry #3](./t-689/3)

#### Question

Does Iron store mass or weight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excellent question. The thing is it really does involve mass, but I’m breaking some physics rules, basically. I have to break a number of physics rules in order to make Magic work in the first place. Those whole laws of Thermodynamics, I’m like “You are my bane!” (laughter) But I try to work within the framework, and I have reasonings built up for myself, and some of them have to be kind of arbitrary. But the thing is, it does store mass if you look at how it interacts, but when a Feruchemist punches someone, you’re not having a mass transference of a 1000 pounds transferring the mass into someone else.

So there are a few little tweaks. You can go talk to Peter, because Peter has the actual math. Oh Peter’s back there. Peter is dressed up as Allomancer Jak from the broadsheet. In fact we’re giving some out broadsheets, aren’t we Peter. So when you come through the line, we’re giving out Broadsheets. Please don’t take fifty—I think we might have enough for everybody. The broadsheets are the newspaper from the
*Alloy of Law*
time. It’s an inworld newspaper. It’s actually reproduced in the book in four different pages, and we put it together in one big broadsheet.

So anyway, you can talk with him, he’s got more of the math of it. I explained the concept to Peter and he’s better with the actual math, so he said “We’ll figure it out.”

## [Entry #4](./t-689/4)

#### Question

How does Hoid know where to go when?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, who does not know who Hoid is? If you want to know about Hoid, the 17th Shard, which is the official fansite for my works, has some great information about him. There is a character who showed up in
*Elantris*
, who showed up in Mistborn, who showed up in
*Warbreaker*
, who showed up in
*Way of Kings*
. All with the same name, the same person. So there’s lots of theorizing about it. How does he know? He has his ways! (general groans) So a little bit more? Just a little bit more? He may be capable of a little bit of foreseeing of certain events, not what’s going to happen, but he may need ot be in a certain place in a certain time.

## [Entry #5](./t-689/5)

#### Question

When will we see a Hoid book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’ll be a little while. He’s playing around with things in the Stormlight Archive if you couldn’t tell, he’s decided to—Hoid is fiddling with things, more than he usually does. But Hoid as a major part of things doesn’t really show up till the third Mistborn trilogy, which is the outer space Mistborn, the sci-fi Mistborn.

If you didn’t know, Mistborn was pitched to my editor as a trilogy of trilogies. I told him I wanted to do a trilogy of epic fantasy books, then the same world in a modern setting, which we’re not to yet, but it’s going to be Allomancers in the 21st century-equivalent technology. It’s an urban fantasy series. Then I wanted to do a Science Fiction series in the same world, using the Epic Fantasy world as kind of a mythology to this new world, and the magic system becoming the means of Space Travel.

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

Whaaa?!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

And so that’s how I pitched Mistborn to my editor.

*Alloy of Law*
is actually a deviation from that, because I didn’t want people to forget about Mistborn, I wanted them to keep reading Mistborn, so I wanted them to keep releasing things, and we’ll eventually get to that second trilogy—

Hey there you are Mark! I heard you got number one.

#### MARK

Yep.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You’re crazy (laughter). You’re awesome though. He even beat the
17thshard
people, which is really a hard thing to do. (oohs and aahs) Two hours. Beat them by two hours.

So
*Alloy of Law*
I wanted to set up things for the second trilogy. I didn’t want to do the second trilogy yet, because the second trilogy, like the first trilogy is kind of bigger books, with a very involved storyline evolved across three books, and I didn’t want to be releasing that parallel to Stormlight Archive, which is the same sort of thing. Very evolved books where you tie a lot of things together, and so I wanted a series of Mistborn novels that were more independent.

*Alloy of Law*
is intended to be a “read it, have fun.” Eventually I may end up doing more with those characters, but when I do, you won’t have to remember that much about this one. It’s not like you have to remember a cast of 500 characters. You can just keep track of the main characters. They’re more of an episodic adventure. I kind of imagine
*Alloy of Law*
being—I’m not totally sure how to describe it. It’s like you have the giant movie that comes out, and then you have a TV show that’s based off of it, and then another big movie series, or something like that, if that makes any sense.

So that’s what
*Alloy of Law*
is. So Hoid is very involved in the third Mistborn trilogy, he’s also very involved in
*Dragonsteel*
, which is actually the first book in the sequence, long before
*Elantris*
happened. So eventually I will tell that story. You can read a draft of it at the BYU library. It’s the only copy that I know of in existence. It’s almost always checked out. It’s my Honors thesis, and it’s not very good. It really is not very good, but basically it’s involving the ideas that eventually will become
*Dragonsteel*
once I write it again. But I stole the Shattered Plains and put them in Roshar instead because the fit better there.

## [Entry #6](./t-689/6)

#### Question

You said you were going to rewrite
*Dragonsteel*
? Is it going to be a one-book thing, or a trilogy, or what?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Dragonsteel*
is set to be seven books. I shouldn't tell you these things, because it scares people. The cosmere sequence is set at, what did I say, 36 books? Yeah, it's 36 books. A trilogy of
*Elantris*
, Two books from
*Warbreaker*
, ten books from
*Way of Kings*
, and the Mistborn series, and some other books. So anyways, this is a big thing, but don't get scared. You don't have to pay attention to any of this. Just go ahead and enjoy the books. This is behind the scene stuff, and in fact the reason why we don't have a book about Hoid is because I don't want you to have read all of those books in order to understand that book, does that make sense? As soon as Hoid becomes a main character, then you have to have read the whole sequence in order to get it. I don't you to have to do that. I don't want you to have to read Mistborn to understand Stormlight Archive. Hoid may be involved in these things, but he will never be a prominent character, changing things, until he gets his own sequence.

## [Entry #7](./t-689/7)

#### Question

How many Feruchemical powers have you revealed in the
*Alloy of Law*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the Ars Arcanum in the back, I have revealed them all. I have not explained them all. (laughter), But I have revealed them all, they are in the back, so you are free to theorize what they mean.

## [Entry #8](./t-689/8)

#### Question

What the heck is Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not going to say that because it would be a spoiler for those who haven’t read the Ars Arcanum yet.

## [Entry #9](./t-689/9)

#### Question

How do you get the different personalities for all your characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

With the characterization for me is a very organic thing. I acutally plot my plot in detail, do my worldbuilding in detail, before I start on my characters though, if I plan them out too much, they don’t have enough life to them. It’s a very weird thing to explain, but for me, what I have to do is I have to try writing through this character’s eyes, and if it doesn’t work, than I actually have to toss that chapter and try again, and often times you’ll see me start a book try a character a couple of times to get them right. And then they just grow into what they are as the plot goes along. And in fact, the characters have veto power over the plot, and so if I get to a point that I feel like a character would not do this, I have to either go back and cast a different person in this role, or —interruption—

If you are very interested in how I write, I do a podcast called Writing Excuses. And what it is is it’s through your browser, so you don’t do anything special, you just go there and press play, and it’s me and Mary Robinette Kowal who writes these books, they’re like Jane Austen with magic. (laughter) Yeah, she’s good. And it’s Dan Wells, who writes these really scary creepy books, but they’re really good, and it’s Howard Tayler. So anyways, Writing Excuses, all you aspiring writers, it’s Hugo-nominated, it's very well received, I think you’ll really enjoy it. You can look by topic, and find where I talk about writing characters, and we’ll give you a ton of advice. There’s two hours of advice on characters you can listen to.

## [Entry #10](./t-689/10)

#### Question

Have you ever thought about making your writing class open?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I have. There are some back and forths here. One thing, about the classes, I really do like teaching at BYU. I like being a BYU teacher, I like being involved a little bit in our Alma Mater, I like coming here, and if I were to make the class open, basically, what I would have to do, I would have to stop teaching at BYU and go to a library or something like that, and just do it in an Auditorium, and I like the class as it is. BYU has policies that say “You have to be a BYU student to go to the class” and that’s not something I can influence or change. So as long as I have it at BYU, it kind of has to be that way. Does that make sense?

Though I’ve tried to let them get me to record it and like Webcast it, but they have requirements and rules that so far we haven’t been able to make that work. But Writing Excuses is basically the way that I do my class without doing my class, if that makes sense.

## [Entry #11](./t-689/11)

#### Question

What’s your schedule like as a writer with so many projects?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, what I do is I get up really early in the morning—noon. I get up at noon. This is hard sometimes! Maybe I’ll get up at 11. Usually I write until 5, and that writing is interspersed with a lot of email, and things like that and kind of distractions. Then I go hang with my family, and then I go back to work, depending on the day, at around 8 or 9, and then I work until about 4, and then I go to bed.

Usually I’m only writing one book at a time, while outlining another, and I’m often revising a third. I can’t do new material usually on two projects at once, I can only do new material on one thing at a time. But I can be doing some revising on one, and some planning on another, but the truth is I’m very much a segmented writer, and work on segments on things. Right now, with the Wheel of Time, I’m usually not working on anything else or planning, I’m all gung ho on this one thing, and then I’ll shift modes and do something else eventually.

## [Entry #12](./t-689/12)

#### Question

I know that Tolkein hated allegory in his story. What is your belief?

#### Brandon Sandrson

Tolkein hated allegory. He thought that his stories should just be stories, and I actually feel similar to him. I do have themes in my books, but I let the theme come as an outgrowth of what the characters are passionate about. And certainly, there are certain things, you’ll read
*Way of Kings*
and Dalinar’s very interested, a very big theme spiritually in the book (I know, that sentence doesn’t make any sense). But, it’s not me going in and intentionally writing an allegory. I like the story to stand as a story, I like telling stories. I’m not big into writing metaphors.

Certain people are very good at that. C.S. Lewis did a great job of that, it’s not what I try to do.

## [Entry #13](./t-689/13)

#### Question

How many marks to a broam? [Stormlight Archive currency]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, Peter—take out the … It’s been so long. I had it at ten, but then I think he came in and said “it can’t be ten”, and so it’s actually in our wiki. Peter—hey, where’s Peter? How many marks are in a broam? Is it ten or 25?

Email Peter, and he’ll tell you. I have to get back into it when I start writing that series again, but I’m so in the Wheel of Time right now, so I’m like “Well it’s Tar Valon marks and...” (laughter)

## [Entry #14](./t-689/14)

#### Question

Have you ever done NaNoWriMo [National Novel Writing Month], and would you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did it several times before I got published [But he never actually did it; see the link at the bottom for more info].
*Way of Kings*
, I wrote during NaNoWriMo, a big portion of it. I actually wrote the NaNoWriMo pep talk this year, they asked me to, and so you’ll get an email from me in your inbox.

Usually, I can’t do NaNoWriMo officially because I’m in the middle of a book, and I can’t stop a book and write another one, I will eventually be able to do that, but the Wheel of Time, and other things have been so busy lately that my schedule doesn’t allow me to in November stop writing. And I’m usually touring in November, almost always. And that’s really tough for getting 50,000 words. If you haven’t done NaNoWriMo, it’s awesome.

## [Entry #15](./t-689/15)

#### Zas678

Can a Drab Return?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A Drab can not Return as the Returned are known, and there are things about the Drab that are not completely understood. But a Drab without a Breath, it’s going to be very hard. Drabs do not Return. Good question, by the way. No one has ever asked me that before.

## [Entry #16](./t-689/16)

#### Question

Who’s going to be the focus for the next
*Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I spent a long time deliberating this, and eventually, in my plotting, I came upon one of those moments where you’re “Ah, this is what I need to do”, so it is going to be Shallan. So the focus for the next book is Shallan, and half of you want it to be Dalinar, and half of you want it to be Shallan, Dalinar will get his book, Shallan will get her book, but there’s a funny story here. In my original outline, I named many of the books, like Dalinar’s is named
*Highprince of War*
. Shallan’s book was actually named after the book that Jasnah gives her, which is very thematically important to her. But then I started telling it to people, and they started laughing, because the book that Jasnah gave her is called the
*Book of Endless Pages*
(laughter).

So, I thought that was a really cool title, but apparently, that’s going to give the reviewers too much fuel. (laughter) So you can pretend in your head that it’s called that, but I’ll come up with a different name.

#### Footnote

Brandon has decided to call book 2 "Words of Radiance"

## [Entry #17](./t-689/17)

#### Question

What’s the future for the Alcatraz books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am actually in negotiations right now to bring the
*Alcatraz*
books to Tor, because we want to recover them, and rerelease them. So it’s kind of in a little bit of a limbo until I can get it to Tor, they were at Scholastic, and we’re in negotiations. There’s some things that I very much like about Scholastic, but at this point we’re kind of want to have all of my books at the same publisher, so if we do that, we will do a rerelease with new covers, then I will do the last book.

#### QUESTION

How can you rerelease a book with a new cover when sometimes you have references in the book to the covers? [Alcatraz made reference to the cover]

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Then I can just add a little addendum to say that the rereleased cover makes sense.

## [Entry #18](./t-689/18)

#### Question

How many magic systems have you gotten rid of, and how do you decide which ones to keep?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s an ever growing process. I mean I’ve started tons of magic systems, dozens, maybe hundreds, and I keep them based on how viral they all are, against the other magic systems I’m thinking of, how well this one appeals to me. Sometimes it depends if I have a book that will fit that magic or not.

For instance, some books are very action-oriented, and some magic systems are not very action-oriented, so the magic needs to fit the book, so they just keep on kind of spinning there till they work.

## [Entry #19](./t-689/19)

#### Question

Do you have particular Inspirations from classics that you brought in your books? I felt like Dalinar was heavily influenced by Constantine.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I did have a degree in English, and so I read lots of stuff, but my favorite classics are
*Moby Dick*
,
*Les Miserables*
, and depending on the day one of the Jane Austen books, it changes. And so those are definite influences. You can probably see some
*Les Mis*
influence, a lot of it, in the Mistborn books. There were several places where I kind of consciously let myself be influenced there. I wouldn’t say that Dalinar though. The thing is, I started writing Dalinar when I was 15. He was my first character. In fact, I posted at Tor.com when
*Way of Kings*
came out a page from my very first novel that I tried to write when I was 14, and it was really really bad, and it has Dalinar in it. He is one of the few characters that survived through all these years from maturing, growing, and things like this. The story of the brother of the king who dies, and the brother must decide: does he take control, or does he let his nephew take control. So a lot of things have influenced Dalinar, but I can’t point to one specific thing.

## [Entry #20](./t-689/20)

#### Question

With the
*Alloy of Law*
being more Steampunk-style, and your genre of choice being fantasy, what things have you done differently in this book than in your previous ones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Just a quick caveat—I don’t really view
*Alloy of Law*
as being Steampunk, but they put goggles on the cover, because Steampunk’s really popular, but I don’t view it as being Steampunk because it doesn’t fit the Victorian feel. It’s much more Edwardian, it’s later era, the book is really based off of 1910 New York, the feel and the culture that is there, but it’s really a Mistborn book. I think when you read it, you’ll feel that it’s more a Mistborn book than it is a Steampunk, or a Western, or anything else. It’s Mistborn. It’s Allomancers with Guns instead. (laughter)

So what have I done differently? I really wanted it to feel like a Mistborn book, with some new elements. It’s really more of a Sherlock Holmes feel than anything else, because I wanted the mystery feel, and I wanted the character dynamic deal with things like that, so this was just a conscious choice to have two or three compelling main characters be in a more episodic story, and I was more focused on that than if it’s Steampunk, or whether this is what, I really want this thematically to feel like a Mistborn book.

## [Entry #21](./t-689/21)

#### Question

What’s the difference between a Dawnshard and a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re actually, they… You will find out. (laughter) I can’t really reveal that right now, because that’s a RAFO. I’ve got RAFO cards that I can give you that say “Sorry I can’t answer your question.”

## [Entry #22](./t-689/22)

#### Question

How did you come up with the Mistborn idea?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Boy, there’s so many different places this came from. The plot came from me wanting to tell a story about a world where the hero failed. You know, the Hero’s Journey a thousand years later, the sort of “What if Frodo had kept the ring?” or “What if Voldemort had killed Harry Potter?” That was one of my big concepts for it. Another big foundational concept was the desire to do a heist story, because I really love those, and I want to do one in the fantasy world.

## [Entry #23](./t-689/23)

#### Question

What do you do to keep yourself from burning out? What do you do to decompress?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I play with my Magic Cards. (Laughter) I go and sort them, I go build a deck.

#### AUDIENCE MEMBER

Roll around in them.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No! I can’t do that! Then they get bent. (More Laughter) That’s basically what I do.

## [Entry #24](./t-689/24)

#### Question

With all the books you have planned, how many years of your life do you have planned out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m intending to live till my 90’s probably, and I’ve got enough books for two books a year until then. (laughter) But I also write quickly, so you’ll get books consistently and hopefully they’ll be funny and interesting. I really do try to work hard to make sure that they are each a self-contained story. The place where I stop doing that is in the last chapter and epilogue, where I really like to punch you, and I’m sorry, it’s just some sort of instinct that I have. It’s like “Oh, everything’s wrapped up—NO IT’S NOT!” (laughter) So I’m sorry about that.

## [Entry #25](./t-689/25)

#### KChan

These are things that I overheard.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kelsier was not spiked.

Part of the Lord Ruler's motivation for setting up The Final Empire was revenge against the people he viewed as encroaching on his people's land. He was also obsessed with creating order, which Ruin later exploited.

The Ars Arcanum in the books were all written by one person.

The author of the Ars Arcanum is either Hoid or a member of the Seventeenth Shard. Brandon also pointed to an annotation on the map of Elendel that's relevant to this question.

There's just the one system in
*Warbreaker*
, and it's also a world with only one Shard on it.

## [Entry #26](./t-689/26)

#### Zas678

These are things that I overhead.

Are the usual quadrants (Physical, Mental, Temporal, Enhancement) preserved in Feruchemy and Hemalurgy?

#### Brandon Sanderson.

No. In Ferchemy, it is based Realmatically. There is a quadrant of Spiritual, a quadrant of Cognitive and two quadrants of Physical.

## [Entry #27](./t-689/27)

#### Zas678

How do Kandra decide gender? Is it just intellectual? Or are there subtle physical differences?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kandra have a specific gender that is associated with scent- you can tell if a kandra is a boy or girl depending on how they smell. There is more to it than that. They also know who they are attracted to.

## [Entry #28](./t-689/28)

#### zas678

Does the person being pierced in order to charge a Hemalurgic spike have to die?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not necessarily. A spike does require you to rip pieces of a soul from the victim, but that does not mean they must die. They would be a very different person afterwords though.

## [Entry #29](./t-689/29)

#### zas678

Why do Seons become broken when their person is taken by the Shaod?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A Seon has a Spiritual Connection with their user. When the Shaod takes the user, it messes up the spiritual nature of the user, and it really messes up the nature of the Seon.

## [Entry #30](./t-689/30)

#### Zas678

The following are quotes from Brandon that he wrote in books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Far from the Central Dominance, skaa can hold land and get rich. The Lord Ruler doesn't let this be known.

## [Entry #31](./t-689/31)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Watch for what happens when something leaves a bendalloy bubble.

#### Footnote

He later said "Ha, that won't make sense for about 10 books," leading many to believe this has to do with FTL travel.

## [Entry #32](./t-689/32)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Entities exist on all three realms that are only vaguely shadowed on the other realms.
You have seen entities who exist primarily on the Cognitive Realm + are shadowed on the Physical.

## [Entry #33](./t-689/33)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Lord Ruler once gave up and tried to end the Final Empire.

## [Entry #34](./t-689/34)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Expanse of the destinies = a world you know.

#### Footnote

This seems to reference the map of the Shadesmar that is in the
*Stormlight Archive*
.
