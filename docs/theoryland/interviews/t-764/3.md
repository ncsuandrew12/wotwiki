# [Interview #764: The China Post: American fantasy author talks about Chinese influence in his best-sellers, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=764#3)

#### The China Post

*The Way of Kings*
, released in 2010 and the first in a scheduled 10-novel series titled "The Stormlight Archive," follows the story of three individuals from different strata of a society through a medieval feudal world thrashed by violent storms.

The author said he also drew heavily on the concept of numerology in Chinese culture to create his magic, because numbers in Chinese have diverse meanings.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"In English a one is a one but in Chinese each number and character has multiple meanings, so the idea of numerology as a superstition and almost as a science was very fascinating for me," said Sanderson, known for the complexity of his magic systems.
