#### Tom Schaad

And we are almost out of time. And on that note, I have to say, Robert Jordan, thank you very much for stopping by. I know it’s been a long several weeks for you. It’s a very cold day here in Washington, DC.

#### Robert Jordan

Very cold. Yes.

#### Tom Schaad

But it could be worse, because it’s snowing back home.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, but it’s not sticking to the ground, I understand. So...

#### Tom Schaad

Oh? Good, good for it. Good for it. Robert Jordan, thank you very much. And we hope to see you again, perhaps when book twelve of The Wheel of Time is out.

#### Robert Jordan

Okay.

#### Tom Schaad

Okay. Well that about does it for this edition of Fast Forward. Hope you found something of interest. Hope you’ll come see us again. Until then, this is Tom Schaad saying, “Take care.”
