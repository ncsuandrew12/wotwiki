# [Interview #182: Fast Forward Interview, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=182#8)

#### Tom Schaad

And, of course, you’re getting more and more coverage in the general media.
*USA Today*
had you in the newspaper today, the day of this interview, talking about the success of the books and the impact that they’ve had. And the websites that have been created that are interested in this in every aspect of the world you’ve created, everything from fan-art to chat forums to role-playing mailing lists to web-rings to resources that intensively analyze every aspect of every line of every book that you’ve written. It’s just remarkable the level of interest.

#### Robert Jordan

It certainly amazes me.

#### Tom Schaad

Does it ever get to the point where it gets a little intrusive in terms of the kinds of things they want to find out about the chapters in the story?

#### Robert Jordan

No. No. I don’t visit the websites, so that doesn’t bother me. And when people ask me questions, whether it’s for a website or not, I either give them an answer which I don’t mind them taking out, or if I don’t want to answer, I have a standard reply for that, one I got from the net: RAFO. R-A-F-O. Read and Find Out.

#### Tom Schaad

Exactly.

#### Robert Jordan

An acronym developed from a phrase that I used to use a great deal. Still do, sometimes.
