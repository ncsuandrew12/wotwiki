#### Tom Schaad

It’s been some time. The last time you were here was when the sixth book in the series,
*Lord of Chaos*
, had been out. And since then, we’ve had four large steps toward that final scene in the story of The Wheel of Time. And this latest one,
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, last week was listed as number one best seller on the
*USA Today*
book list. It’ll be coming out on
*The New York Times*
as the number one best seller. Does that ever get old?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh no, good God! How could that ever get old? I hear that I’m going to be number one and I get out into the middle of the floor and do a little dance. No, that never gets old.
