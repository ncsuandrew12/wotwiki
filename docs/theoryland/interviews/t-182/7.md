#### Tom Schaad

It’s practically near the end of the promotional book that you’ve been on for the
*Crossroads of Twilight*
. What’s the experience been like this time?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, wonderful. It’s always wonderful. I spend most of my life as a hermit, sitting at my desk reading and writing, and I don’t get to speak to people very often. I talk to Harriet, my wife, and a few friends, but not to any great degree, any great number of people. But I come out on tour, and there are lots of people who want to talk to me, and it’s lots of fun. We’ve had large crowds a number of places. Over six hundred people some times.

#### Tom Schaad

Good heavens.

#### Robert Jordan

And it’s just been terrific.

#### Tom Schaad

So that... I would assume that’s... Now that’s got a be a validation of the work as a whole. To have that kind of a response when you make yourself available to the public to meet the author, the creator of something they feel very strongly about.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, it’s a validation. Yes.
