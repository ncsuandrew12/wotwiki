This is the tour for the tenth book—you’re almost finished with it—and you’ve had large crowds. Has there been any one specially moment, or any one particular encounter that stands out from all the others?

Oh....walking into Barnes and Noble, Union Square; being told that there were over six hundred and fifty people there. And they gave me a standing ovation when I walked up to the podium. That really caught me. I had a man tell me that his son was reading the books; that they were easing his stay in the hospital. And when I said, as you do, “Well I hope it’s nothing serious,” he said, “Well it is. It’s cancer.” And I said, “I hope that he will get better.” And he said, “No. He’s dying. But he loves your books.” And that’s going to stick with me a long time.

#### Tom Schaad

I can imagine it would.
