#### Tom Schaad

I understand that there may be, before the next book in this particular story of Rand al’Thor, there may be something else that you’ll be... that’ll be published that you will have written.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. I was asked by my publisher to expand the novella "New Spring". That came about because he heard me talking about the fact that in order to compress that story in a novella length I had cut out several story lines, and had compacted a number of other things just to fit the length. And I happened to remark that I what I had wanted to write would have come out at sixty or seventy thousand words, and he said, “Well that’s a novel,” and, “how would you like to do it as a short novel?” And I said, “Well, alright.” So that will be coming out before the next actual Wheel of Time book.
