#### Tom Schaad

And we have, of course, ten now. We have at least two more to wait for. Plus a small novel prior to those final two books. Is it at a point where you can occasionally think beyond the completion of this cycle to the next stage in your writing life?

#### Robert Jordan

I’ve been doing that for the last seven or eight years. I started a long time ago thinking, “Well, what am I going to do when this is over?” I have to do something that is good. Hopefully something that is better then The Wheel of Time. And so I’ve been pushing that around in my head. I know to a large extent what I will do. So that I know I will first take a brief vacation. I’ll try to make it a long vacation, but I have a habit of slipping back to my computer, and starting to write again. And then, after the vacation, I will sit down and start writing the next thing, and I don’t think there’ll be any significant lapse.
