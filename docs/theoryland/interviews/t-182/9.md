#### Tom Schaad

Now, there was a little excitement before the release of
*Crossroads*
, when
*Locus Magazine*
, which is kind of a specialty magazine in science fiction and fantasy publishing, erroneously stated that this was going to be the final book in The Wheel of Time.

#### Robert Jordan

Oh yes, it set my blood pressure up a bit, actually.

#### Tom Schaad

And we know it’s not. We know it’s not because you’ve stated quite categorically that this is going to be a measured pace, that there’s not going to be any quick wrap-up because you’re not going to treat something that you’ve worked on so hard and so carefully that way.

#### Robert Jordan

No, at least two more books, I’m afraid.

#### Tom Schaad

And I’m sure there are a great number of people who are perfectly happy with at least two more books.

#### Robert Jordan

I’ve had some people say they’d like five or ten, but I generally throw something at them.
