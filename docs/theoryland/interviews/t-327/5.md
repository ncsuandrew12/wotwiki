# [Interview #327: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#5)

#### Jeff VanderMeer

Was it a hard decision to finish Jordan's series? Can you tell us where you were when the offer came, and what your first thoughts were?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The initial decision was easy. I made it in a flash, the first time Mr. Jordan's wife asked if I would be interested in this project. (That offer came over the phone via two conversations--first, a preliminary call to see if I was interested. Second, an official call about a month later to offer me the project.) Since I'm a fan of the series, my initial instincts were "OF COURSE I want to be involved in this!" It wasn't until after I hung up the phone that the doubts began to rise. Who am I to finish this, the greatest fantasy epic of my generation? I can't fill Robert Jordan's shoes. Fortunately, I've now seen the quality of the material he left behind. That has quieted most of my doubts. The story is all here. It is his book. My job is to fill in a few holes and smooth out the prose.
