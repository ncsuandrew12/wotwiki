# [Interview #327: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#10)

#### Jeff VanderMeer

What are you currently working on, and what's your deadline for the Jordan book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As of very recently, I'm done with my next two books both for Tor and Scholastic. That leaves an entire year open to work on
*A Memory of Light*
. I don't know how long it will take me, but that's how long I have to write it. (My deadline is in December.) Right now, I'm focusing on re-reading the entire Wheel of Time series through again with an eye for how the characters think and speak. I should start working on the text itself sometime in February.
