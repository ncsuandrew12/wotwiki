# [Interview #327: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#1)

#### Jeff VanderMeer

With the tragic passing of Robert Jordan last year, the world lost a writer who had become an iconic figure to his millions of fans. In the weeks following Jordan's death, many of those same fans understandably wondered how or if the fantasist's bestselling The Wheel of Time series would be completed. Then news came from Tor that Brandon Sanderson, a fantasy and children's book author, had accepted an offer to write a final volume called
*A Memory of Light*
, using Jordan's dictated notes about the plot. Sanderson had been working on his own Mistborn series and a follow-up to
*Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians*
. I recently talked to Sanderson via email about Jordan's legacy and about how he became involved with
*A Memory of Light*
, which is scheduled for release in 2009.
