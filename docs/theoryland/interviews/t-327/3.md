# [Interview #327: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#3)

#### Jeff VanderMeer

What about his fiction do you particularly enjoy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan's genius, in my opinion, was in his ability to blend the familiar with the original. When I read his books, particularly during my younger years, they felt like fantasy to me without reading like the same fantasy books I'd read so many times before. By now, he has become his own archetype, but at that point he was just so much more fresh than anything I'd read before. To this day, I love his world-building and his ability to get deep inside a character's mind and show you who they are and how they feel. As I've grown older, I have come to appreciate his ability to work lavish description and extensive world building into his stories without breaking the narrative. Reading his books is a treat for both the senses and the mind.
