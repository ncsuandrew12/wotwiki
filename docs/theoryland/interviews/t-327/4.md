# [Interview #327, Entry #4]: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#4)

What are your impressions of Jordan as a person and a working professional?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One thing stands out to me. During those last weeks before his passing, Mr. Jordan spent a great deal of time dictating the plot of this book to those around him. He felt that he had promised an ending to his fans, and was dedicated to making certain this book got finished for them. This coincides with everything else I know of the man. He was always kind and generous during signings and tours. He always spoke highly of his readers and the people around him. He was selfless. His mind was focused on his family first, his readers second, and himself as a distant third.
