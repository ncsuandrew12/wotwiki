# [Interview #327, Entry #6]: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#6)

#### Jeff VanderMeer

Jordan's fans, obviously, are pretty hardcore about his work. Are you aware of any reaction from them about you taking up the reins?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They've been very encouraging. Some few are negative, but the overwhelming majority of them are thankful that they'll be able to read the book. They seem to support Mr. Jordan's wife in her decision, even if the fans don't know me or my work. We all understand that I'm not Mr. Jordan. Nobody is claiming that I am. He's the one who should have finished this book. Unfortunately, we lost him, and there is nothing to be done besides see that his last work is completed. The goal of everyone working on this project is to do him proud.
