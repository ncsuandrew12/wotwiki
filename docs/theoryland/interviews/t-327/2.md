# [Interview #327, Entry #2]: Omnivoracious: Brandon Sanderson on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=327#2)

#### Jeff VanderMeer

How well did you know Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't know him at all. I saw him once at a convention—once—and didn't even realize who it was until someone told me. To me, Mr. Jordan still is—and will probably always be—something of a mythical figure.
