#### DefiantBurrito

Can you tell me what Wit put in his drink in Shallan's flashback scene?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was something that you or I would probably not want to eat in our world, but that Wit got some benefit from eating...

#### DefiantBurrito

Something we've seen in the Mistborn books, perhaps?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(sounding pleased) Yes, perhaps like something you've seen in Mistborn.
