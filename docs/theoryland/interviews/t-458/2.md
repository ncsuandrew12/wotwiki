# [Interview #458, Entry #2]: TGS Signing Report - Shannon Berndston](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=458#2)

#### Shannon Berndston

After dinner we trekked over to the Harvard Coop for the signing. Brandon introduced the book. He talked a bit about what the Wheel of Time series means to him, and how he became a writer in the first place.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Did you know that he wrote 13 books before getting one of them published?
*Elantris*
was number six in that list, but he never gave up on his dream of being a writer. We also heard about how Harriet read Brandon’s eulogy for RJ and subsequent read of Mistborn. After two chapters, she was hooked and knew that he was the man to finish her husband’s series.
