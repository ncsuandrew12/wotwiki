# [Interview #458: TGS Signing Report - Shannon Berndston, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=458#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Other information that we gleaned from dinner included learning that Aviendha is the favorite out of the three in Rand’s “harem.” Hopefully we’ll get to see more of Pevara being awesome, but that could possibly appear in a novella on Brandon’s web page that will fill in some missing holes. But no promises! And one last interesting fact, in order to get the Illianer and Taraboner accents right, he wrote the book then went back and did a search for all the characters of those nations and then worked on their crazy accents.

#### Footnote

The Pevara novella was to be about the events at the Black Tower. Brandon later decided that the novella
[probably wasn't going to work](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=549#6)
. He got
[two chapters](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#21)
into
*Towers of Midnight*
, and
[the rest](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=762#1)
into
*A Memory of Light*
.
