# [Interview #458, Entry #4]: TGS Signing Report - Shannon Berndston](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=458#4)

#### Shannon Berndston

A question was asked about Robert Jordan’s notes—particularly how they were left.

#### Brandon Sanderson

We were told that Harriet has said that Jordan has left more in notes than in the series itself! Brandon then related a story about how he needed to know who was traveling with Perrin. He asked RJ’s assistants to look to see if there was a file with that info. A few days later he received an email titled “traveling with Perrin.” Unfortunately it listed every single person from the Two Rivers and their occupation who was traveling with Perrin. Some hadn’t even appeared in the books!
