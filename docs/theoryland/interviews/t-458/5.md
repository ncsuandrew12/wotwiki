# [Interview #458: TGS Signing Report - Shannon Berndston, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=458#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some other info that we learned during the Q&A included finding out that the most rewarding part of writing
*The Gathering Storm*
for Brandon was working with Harriet. It took 18 months of 14 hour days (although that includes a chunk of
*Towers of Midnight*
) to finish the book. The Two Rivers and Andoran characters were the easiest for him to write, while the Aiel and Seanchan were the hardest.
