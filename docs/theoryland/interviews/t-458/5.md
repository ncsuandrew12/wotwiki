#### Brandon Sanderson

Some other info that we learned during the Q&A included finding out that the most rewarding part of writing
*The Gathering Storm*
for Brandon was working with Harriet. It took 18 months of 14 hour days (although that includes a chunk of
*Towers of Midnight*
) to finish the book. The Two Rivers and Andoran characters were the easiest for him to write, while the Aiel and Seanchan were the hardest.
