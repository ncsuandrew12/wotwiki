# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#65)

#### Question

What Jasnah did, in the first book, with Shallan in the alleyway. And what happened at the end of this book, between Adolin and the other character. Would you put them on the same level? Or would you say that what Adolin did was maybe a little bit darker?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that what Adolin did was less dark, personally. I would say that what Adolin did was something that needed to be done, that no one else was capable of doing.

#### Question

Will it have any ramifications for him down the line? With how it was handled?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, there are definitely ramifications. How it's handled, there's lots of ramifications. And there are certain characters who would think that what he did is totally, totally, totally wrong.
