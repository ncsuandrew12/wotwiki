#### a young girl

How were you inspired by
*Dragonsbane*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was inspired by just how imaginative it was. I had never read a fantasy book before and I loved the idea of another world that was so similar and yet so different from our own.

#### Question (later)

When you read that one book, was that where your inspiration started, or were you alwaysâ€”

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was always telling stories, but I didn't find fantasy, and myself in fantasy, until I read that book.
