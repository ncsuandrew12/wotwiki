# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #59](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#59)

#### Question

Kaladin in the second book seemed to be a different Kaladin than at the end of the first book.

#### Brandon Sanderson

What way?

#### Question

Angrier, and my question is, why did you write him that way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He has always been angry. In the first book, he is focused on saving his men and now that his men are safe, all of those emotionsâ€”if you go look at him from the first nine chapters of
*Way of Kings*
, he's that way there, it's when he becomes focused on saving his men he has something to drive him and it kind of subsumes these things, but once they're safe all these things he hasn't dealt with came back out.
