# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #75](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#75)

#### Question

I know that there's three sorts of forms that magic presents itself in, the liquid and the solid and air. What would Breath be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Breath is definitely like Mist, it is in the form of the air.

#### Question

And is Stormlight the same?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Stormlight is the same. Good questions!

#### Question

Would Vasher be able to use Stormlight in the same way that he can get Breath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would not be immediately easy, but Stormlight could feed Nightblood.

#### Question

Which is why Szeth can wield Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Eh, you'll have to see if â€¦ but yes. That could theoretically happen. You can use most of the magics on most of the planets to fuel the other magics, if you know how to do it, it is not easy.
