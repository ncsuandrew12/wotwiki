# [Interview #1052, Entry #43]: WOR Signing Table Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#43)

#### Question

You talked about how when you're reading it's an active process and you're almost like the narrator of the story, you're inventing details that aren't necessarily in the book. How much of that process do you think gets lost in the audiobook process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think you lose a little bit, but you gain a little bit in return, their interpretation, and things like that. It does happen, you lose a little bit, but you get something else in return.
