# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#13)

#### Rhandric

Is Vasher trying to find Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher misses Nightblood and feels responsible for him.

#### Rhandric

How many worldhoppers have we seen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I haven't kept track, you've seen quite a few. There's one from Mistborn, did you catch him? I don't think people have really picked out the Terriswoman yet, who makes her way into them, but they're mostly not supposed to be noticeable yet, until you get to know them as characters and you look back and be like "oh that was that person."

#### Rhandric

Is it the Terriswoman I think it is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know which Terriswoman you think it is.

#### Rhandric

Tindwyl?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Kurkistan

Speaking of the Terriswoman, is she the nurse in
*Warbreaker*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

< Pauses; gleefully says > RAAAAAAFO!

#### Footnote

The last Q&A was transcribed by Kurkistan.
