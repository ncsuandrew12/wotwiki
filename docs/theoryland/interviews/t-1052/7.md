# [Interview #1052, Entry #7]: WOR Signing Table Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#7)

#### Question

We were talking that it's kind of a shame that Dalinar doesn't have his own "real" spren. I think it's an upgrade, is there a way I should think of this? Is it a cool thing or a bad thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a cool thing, it's also a very dangerous thing.

#### Question

Well [the Stormfather] controls the highstorms ... follow-up question: if he dies, does that affect the spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dying, as long as the oaths are not broken, does not affect the spren in a very terrible way. There are effects.
