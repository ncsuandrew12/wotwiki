#### 8-year-old girl

When is the next Alcatraz book coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am working on it right now, I hope to have it out by next year. I'm not sure when, but hopefully next year. [...] I did buy [the rights] back and I sold them to Tor, who's releasing a new edition, so you won't have to order them in from the UK anymore. [...] We will have a Tor edition starting in 2015, hopefully with the last book.
