# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #99](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#99)

#### Leiyan

I'm curious about the sun, it's described as white, and our sun is typically described as yellow. Is it a different type of star?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The yellowing of our sun is not actually caused...so our sun being yellow is not based on the star's actual color.
