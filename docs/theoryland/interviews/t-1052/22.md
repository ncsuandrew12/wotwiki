# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#22)

#### Sweetness

Since the evil on Threnody isn't a Shard, can you tell us anything about its actual nature? Is it an actual being, and is it related to Adonalsium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Everything is related to Adonalsium in the Cosmere, most of the magic you're seeing is a just a natural outgrowth of Cosmere related magic and cognitive shadows. The Evil is similarly related.
