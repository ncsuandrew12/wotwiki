# [Interview #1052, Entry #63]: WOR Signing Table Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#63)

#### Question

Do you know if Graphic Audio is ever going to tackle the Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would like them to, but it's really up to Tor Audio, or actually MacMillian Audio. They are the ones, because we sold the audio rights to them, that would decide when they're going to do subsidiary licenses. Which they only recently decided on Mistborn. So I'm sure Graphic Audio would like to do it, probably after a few books of this are out they'll start doing it.
