#### Question

Have you listened to your books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have. I do really like Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, so I listen just to see what their interpretation is. I love that Herdazians are Australian.

#### Question

Are they on for the rest of the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Well, they said that they will as long as they're free.
