# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#11)

#### Leiyan

Can you tell me the order of the three planets in the solar system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Leiyan

Because I know Braize is the third one, I've heard that, is that true?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm staying closed-lipped about a lot of this.

#### Leiyan

Can you tell me which is the most massive moon [of Roshar]? Not the biggest, but the most massive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think the biggest is the most massive. All three moons are much closer than our moon is.

#### Leiyan

And so is that Nomon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Leiyan

How big is Nomon on the night sky, like compared to our moon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Larger than our moon, but not dominating of the sky. [...] I do believe Nomon is bigger, but I had to have Peter run those calculations, so he may come back and say no Brandon, that's not possible, but I do believe it's bigger than our moon in the sky. You're supposed to be able to see moderately well by Nomon.

#### Leiyan

So I had some things I figured out, I just wanted to know if they're true or not. So I have that the orbits of the moons would precess so that the farthest point is always pointing towards the sun.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, one more time.

#### Leiyan

[uses diagram to explain the question]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, we have figured all this out. It's in the wiki--so me just saying--it's not in the wiki that you can find. I would need to go compare this. All the calculations on things like this--this is stuff where I sat down with Peter, who knows much more astronomy than me and said "here's what I want" and he's like "well it has to be this" and I put that in.

#### Leiyan

Do you know, do the moons orbit the opposite direction to Roshar's rotation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe they do but I'm not 100% sure.

#### Leiyan

There's no eclipses as far as I can tell, so the plane of the orbit must be strongly inclined, 'cause there'd be an eclipse every day if there were eclipses-

#### Brandon Sanderson

We had to fudge that because as you said, if there were any it'd be all the time.
