#### RIT

Alright, glowing Shardplate and retractable helmets. Is that a similar origin of the Shardbladesâ€”

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's a similarity, but they are also very different.

#### RIT

Yeah, I noticed they do seem like advanced fabrials, because Adolin just keeps going on and on about how they're all interchangeable and how they all feel comfortable after a while, and it doesn't have the same kind of thing with the Shardblades.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it doesn't. Though a Shardblade, used for a long time, will change shape slightly.
