# [Interview #1052, Entry #60]: WOR Signing Table Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#60)

#### Question

Birthright.

Ah ...

#### Question

So I've been in contact a little bit with [something], I own a RP gamer, and they went radio silence on me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yeah. I had dinner with Matt Scott like two weeks ago, he said it's still in development, but he's like buying a game studio that was working on it, or something? He had farmed it out? I think. So I don't know.

#### Question

Are you still writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wrote the story for them to use. The idea was I write the story, they build the game, and come back to me for dialogue. So I have got an overarching story for them but I don't write the dialogue till we actually have a game to plug things into. That's still my plan. He's still really interested in buying the Mistborn movie option, and he says that he's working on a mobile game, so he's really awesome ... but I have nothing to tell you right now.
