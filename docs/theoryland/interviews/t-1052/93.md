#### EHyde

What information do Stormwardens use to predict Highstorms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, many things, some of which is necessary to the process and some of which is not. But previous highstorm arrival is a very big part of it, and highstorms from previous years, most recent highstorms, and if they can get when the highstorm left the other side, that's a calculation that will help them, and things like this.
