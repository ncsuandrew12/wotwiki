#### Question

Do you think you're going to write in the Wheel of Time world at all?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's unlikely that I'll ever do any more Wheel of Time books. I don't think that Robert Jordan would want it to keep going.

#### Question

What about your
*Steelheart*
, how manyâ€”?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a trilogy. I've finished the second book and turned it in, then one more left to do, and then it'll be done.

#### Question

Final and kaput? No multiple trilogies?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmm ... you know, I could see ... but I have no plans right now to do any more. I have my next YA book that I've already got planned what I'm going to do.

#### Question

*The Rithmatist*
, how many in that series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's also three.
