# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #74](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#74)

#### Question

When does a person become a Surgebinder? Because Kaladin talks about when he was a child, about it being a familiar feeling, and Shallan obviously was younger. Or is it when they speak the Words?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The bond starts forming before the words are spoken, but if the words are never spoken that bond will eventually evaporate and get broken. But the bond will start forming before. Just like an emotion attracts a spren, acting in the way that the spren you would eventually bond will start drawing them toward you and that will start to create that bond.
