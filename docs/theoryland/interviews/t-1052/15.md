#### Question

Have you thought any more about metal allergies with your Allomancy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It definitely wouldn't be pleasant.

#### Question

Ok, I have this steel allergy, I got it last year, and I work in a steel plant.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would not be pleasant, but I would have the instinct that fewer people on Scadrial would have that allergy, because of the Investiture during their creation. But, it could totally happen.
