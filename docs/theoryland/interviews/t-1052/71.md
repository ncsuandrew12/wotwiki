# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #71](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#71)

#### Question

Which of your characters do you think would win in a fight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh … at what stage in their career?

#### Question

Not the Slivers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, so they don't count, the Shards of Adonalsium don't count … does Kelsier have atium?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Then … a Mistborn burning atium is really hard to beat in any other way.

#### Question

So you think that Kelsier would beat Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Kelsier would beat Vin if he had atium and she didn't. If they both did? Vin has more raw talent, Kelsier has more experience. So if you can pick Vin after she has more experience she will give him a fair fight, otherwise, not.
