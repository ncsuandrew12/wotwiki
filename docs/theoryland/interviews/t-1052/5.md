#### Question

How often do your characters take you completely by surprise when you're doing the actual writing, and take you away from your outline?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They don't do that. I cast people in my role, like not real people but I try a character out, and if they fit the role I keep going with them and if they don't then I throw that chapter away and I cast someone else. I rarely have someone go complete crazy off what I was expecting, if they do, it means they were probably the wrong character for that role.
