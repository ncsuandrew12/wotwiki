# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#32)

#### Question

You talk about music a lot in your books, but you never talk about the notation, or how advanced they've come with the chords and scales and stuff, do you have that all planned out or is that justâ€”

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have an idea in my head, but it's not something I spend a lot of time worldbuilding. [...] I play trumpet, not piano, so my music theory is all squished through brass, which leaves me with kind of a weird perspective on it. My wife did music theory, and played piano, and all this stuff, and me it's like, you know, "it comes out the front of the horn!"

#### Footnote

Music theory is generally easiest for pianists because they play more than one note at a time (as many as 11-12), and can play several voices in counterpoint with each other. Trumpet players often can't even read bass clef; pianists read both clefs and more commonly have the ability to play in any key.
