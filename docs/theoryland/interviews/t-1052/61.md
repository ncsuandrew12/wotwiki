# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #61](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#61)

#### Question

The epigraphs for The Way of Kings, that were talking about how the various Shardholders are influenced by their shards over time--how does that impact someone like Harmony, with multiple shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The main effect it's having on Harmony right now is his inability to act sometimes, because his two sides are pushing, and so he is having trouble being proactive. It'd take a long time before it really becomes manifest, but he's had several hundred years, so it's starting to have an effect.
