# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #45](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#45)

#### Question

I wanted to ask about how, you mentioned that in the [third] trilogy for Mistborn, all the things are tied together. All the different worlds. In books that you write after you've written that, are you going to attempt to tie them in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will tie them in. I've already seeded hidden things that I can use to tie them in the way I want to. So it should all be there, the things I want to use. When you read, watch for a character named Hoid.
