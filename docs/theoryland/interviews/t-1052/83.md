#### Question

Does Szeth have a puppy, and what would it be like if he did? Because I feel like he could really use one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Szeth could totally use a puppy. He totally could. He does not have an axehound pup, but he totally should get one. But he does now have something very puppy-like.
