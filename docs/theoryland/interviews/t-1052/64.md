#### Question

Before the Recreance, there were three Bondsmiths. Did they all bond supersprens, or is Dalinar an exception?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They did something similar.

#### Question

Can the Unmade be bonded?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow...plausible. Er, possible, I should say.

#### Question

If you came up with a Radiant-like ideal, for yourself as a writer, what would it be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What a great question! (writes the answer in asker's book).

#### Footnote

Does this imply that the unmade are spren?
