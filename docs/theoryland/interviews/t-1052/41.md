# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#41)

#### Question

So, Joshua [Bilmes ha]s looked at two of my manuscripts, how many did he look at of yours beforeâ€”?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think he looked at four. [...] If you're continuing to get better and better feedbacks, that's a really good sign with Joshua. Now, you should also be sending other places. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. But as long as you're getting increasingly good feedback, then he's paying attention, and he doesn't read a lot of new authors' work anymore, he has his assistants do that, so if he is reading it himself (and if he says he is, he is) then you are in a good position.
