# [Interview #1052, Entry #86]: WOR Signing Table Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#86)

#### Question

What's your working title for the third book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It has two. The original working title was Stones Unhallowed. However, Rothfuss is using Doors of Stone, and I kind of feel like I might want to do something different, so my interim title is Skybreaker, but it has to be an in-world book. The in-world book for book 3 is kind of a different one, so I can do a lot with it, but Stones Unhallowed is easier.
