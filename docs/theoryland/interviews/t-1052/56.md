# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #56](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#56)

#### Question

Who helped you go on when you had to do those eighteen drafts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My wife is a big support to me, but I wasn't married during the early books, and then it was just my own desire to write, and I did have a writing group that helped me, and they're good people too.
