# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#26)

#### Question

Is it the power of the bond between humans and spren, the Nahel bond, or from the swords—the existing Shardblades—that causes the eyes to turn light?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh ... yes.

#### Question

Does each specific order have their own spren that they would bond?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Each order has a spren that is distinctive. All Windrunners come from wind— from honorspren.
