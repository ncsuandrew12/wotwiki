# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #87](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#87)

#### Question

If somebody with some kind of magical ability, for example Allomancy, etc., were to travel off-world, would they still have that ability?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the ability. Some are easier to use off-world than others. You have seen Allomancy used off-world already.
