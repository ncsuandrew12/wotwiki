#### Leiyan

On the back of the Szeth card, it's a gamepiece?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, they just printed all of those random words there! Random collections of letters. It's really surprising that they would print all this on the back of the card and have it happen to turn out to spell out things like "Investiture," I can't believe that! I have no idea why that might've happened.
