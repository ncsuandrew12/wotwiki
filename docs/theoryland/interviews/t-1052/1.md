# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#1)

#### EHyde

All right, the transcript is finished to the best of my ability. Most of the juicy questions were already in NutiketAiel's report, but if people want the exact wording, and there's some other good stuff too, especially some fun less cosmere-related stuff.

#### Footnote

This is not the general Q&A but the questions asked at the signing table. Some questions were omitted because they were reported by the people who asked the questions, in which case their paraphrases were replaced with the verbatim transcript.
