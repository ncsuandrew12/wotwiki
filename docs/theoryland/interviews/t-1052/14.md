# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#14)

#### Question

Do you have any say in your covers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have a lot more than I used to. Originally, not much, though Tor, to their credit, even the first cover asked meâ€”gave me a choice of three illustrators, and said "which of these three would you like the most? And then I picked Stephan Martiniere, and I got the cover from him, that I really liked. Nowadays I can say "give me this artist" and they do.
