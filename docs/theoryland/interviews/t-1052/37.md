# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#37)

#### Question

Did you ever make a conscious choice to be as open as you are, in your process, with your fans?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was just really natural to me. I think it was me looking at things that I wished authors were doing, and I'm a product of my generation, with the internet and things like that, so, I wouldn't say conscious.
