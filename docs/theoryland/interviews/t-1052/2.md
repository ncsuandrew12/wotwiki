# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#2)

#### Question

Did it seem really awkward working with someone else's characters, with Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I thought that it would, but the fact that I've been reading them since I was a kid, they felt really natural to me, like writing my own characters. I'm quite pleasedâ€”I was quite surprised. Perrin and Rand and everyone, they're like my high school buddies. It was refreshingly familiar to me.
