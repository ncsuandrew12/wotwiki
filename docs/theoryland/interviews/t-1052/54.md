# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #54](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#54)

#### Question

Are the Wax and Wayne stories going to always be in stand-alone, or are they ever going to tie in to the main Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They will tie in, in fact I intended the first one to foreshadow stuff for the next trilogy, so you will find things tying in with what's going on, but I kind of wanted them to just be more independent, so we'll see. It'll be a little of both.
