# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#17)

#### Question

You said you've played Magic since it came out, what kind do you play the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I play draft the most right now, particularly cube draft, but any sort of draft I can be a part of I love. [...] And you know, any time I can play I enjoy it, but if there's a set that I can draft some sort of screwy combo deck like spider spawning or swarm or something, then that's the sort of set I love. Or some sort of screwy five color deck.

#### Question

I play a lot of commander.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Every time I play commander I get stomped. I haven't quite figured out how to make a commander deck that doesn't get stomped. But of course I think that the format's all about everyone getting stomped so, it makes sense.
