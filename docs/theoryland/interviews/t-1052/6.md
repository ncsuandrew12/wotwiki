# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#6)

#### Question

If Taravangian made the Diagram, and telling the future is of the Voidbringers, is that a bad sign?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on if you're speaking culturally or actually magically.

#### Question

Magically, I guess.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because he would claim to you that he did it all with strength of mind and no magical influence other than enhanced mind. That's what he would tell you. And so in that case it would not beâ€”culturally they'd look very weirdly at it, but spiritually he would say it's not of the Voidbringers.

#### Question

Right. He would say that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh-huh.
