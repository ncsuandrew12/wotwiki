# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #66](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#66)

#### Question

Hoid said [in Warbreaker] that he learned stories from a place where gods have died. Is that Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. I will say this. A god has died on Roshar. Only one, that we know. So, "gods" would not be plural.
