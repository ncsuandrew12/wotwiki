# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #73](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#73)

#### Question

If someone--Vasher says that Nightblood would kill him, is that just because he has this big deific Breath? Would it kill an ordinary person, like a drab?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would suck the Breath from anybody, and if they were unable to feed it he would feed on their soul.

#### Question

So they would die.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Anybody wielding Nightblood, he will suck their soul. For too long, he will eventually, if you draw him, he will suck your soul.
