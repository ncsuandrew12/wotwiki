# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #52](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#52)

#### Question

How are you going to finish the Cosmere stuff? Like when you get to book 35, how are you gonna resist like book 36, we're gonna say "Courage is held by a guy named Steve and according to Hoid he's pretty cool." Just extend it another ... how are you going to finish?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We'll see. We will see. The thing is there's a beginning, middle, and end to the shattering of Adonalsium and the involvement there. More stories can be told in the Cosmere, but there's a beginning, middle, and end to that. When I finish that, that is the sequence that I wanted to tell.

#### Question

And you have that outlined out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do.
