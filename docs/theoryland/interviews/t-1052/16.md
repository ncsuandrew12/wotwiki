# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#16)

#### Question

I really like the leatherboundâ€”are these [the Stormlight Archive] ever going to come out in a leatherbound edition?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would assume that someday we will make that happen, but it is not in the near future. You'll probably see a Mistborn leatherbound first. To kind of gauge the market.
