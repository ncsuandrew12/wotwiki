# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#9)

#### Question

So regarding Hoid, are we ever going to learn his real name at any point in time? I guess in
*Dragonsteel*
? I know he says about how he's borrowing stuff and about how he steals stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. You eventually know his real name, but it depends on what you define as real.

#### Question

So also, regarding the magic systems and stuff, I hear you have another book that's unpublished and that you can send it to people.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, just drop an email, say that you want a copy of
*White Sand*
. It's okay. It's not great.
