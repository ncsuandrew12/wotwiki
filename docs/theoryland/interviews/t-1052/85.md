#### Question

The Aimians seem disliked throughout the world. Is that based on something that has happened in the past?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes, but they're also really creepy.

#### Question

Are they open to manipulation like other sentient non-human humanoids of Roshar? The Parshendi? Or, similar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, RAFO.
