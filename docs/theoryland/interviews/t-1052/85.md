# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #85](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#85)

#### Question

The Aimians seem disliked throughout the world. Is that based on something that has happened in the past?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes, but they're also really creepy.

#### Question

Are they open to manipulation like other sentient non-human humanoids of Roshar? The Parshendi? Or, similar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, RAFO.
