# [Interview #1052: WOR Signing Table Q&A, Entry #96](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1052#96)

#### Leiyan

I'm guessing it's a RAFO, but why do Honorblades work the way they do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Honorblades were crafted before Shardblades existed--

#### Leiyan

So they were crafted.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They were crafted before Shardblades existed, and all Shardblades that exist came about as certain individuals trying to find out how to copy Honorblades.

#### Leiyan

So would it be fair to say that Honorblades are analagous to fabrials in some sense? Trap spren in a crystal yada yada Stormlight power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is an analogy there, that I think would pass the SAT's rigor for analogies.
