# [Interview #1148: Shadows of Self-Denver, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1148#5)

#### Granvil4

I asked if Sazed is the only one to hold more than one Shard.

#### Brandon Sanderson

“Sazed is the only one to currently hold two Shards.” After a few seconds, he added, “I’m not going to say he is the only one to ever hold two.” That’s all he said about it though.
