There was some question of that during the period Jordan wrote Conan novels. When Tor Books got underway in 1981, Jordan was selected to resume the series originated by Robert E. Howard and continued by L. Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter, Poul Anderson and others.

#### Robert Jordan

"I turned down the offer to do a Conan book initially. I was dubious about the prospect of writing in someone else's universe. But later, I agreed to do it and was surprised to find it a kick to return the character to his youthâ€”ideal for a series aimed at adolescent readers. Writing the Conan novels necessitated following a strict framework, and, as I've said, I don't especially like that sort of externally imposed discipline. So, I had to puzzle out how I could be fresh and original within a box already constructed by others' hands."
