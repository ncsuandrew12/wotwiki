#### William B. Thompson

In the realm of fantasy writing, Jordan has been less influenced than simply entertained by such works as Donaldson's
*Thomas Covenant*
series and the horror writing of Stephen King.

He never reads fantasy when he is in the midst of writing it.

#### Robert Jordan

"I read fantasies in between books. When writing, I make it a point to read other genres, plus philosophy, history, biography, mythology."
