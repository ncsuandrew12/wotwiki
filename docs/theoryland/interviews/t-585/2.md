#### Steve Goedecke

Hello from your fans at Stormblessed.com, and thank you for taking the time to answer some questions for us! And we'd also like to say, Congratulations on another NYT bestseller with
*Towers of Midnight*
! I think that is an endorsement from the Wheel of Time readership, and well-deserved, for your work on
*The Gathering Storm*
.
