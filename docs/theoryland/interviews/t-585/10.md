# [Interview #585: Stormblessed.com Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=585#10)

#### Question

Everyone's favorite Wheel of Time question has been answeredâ€”after
*Towers of Midnight*
, we now know who killed Asmodean. It doesn't seem right to leave you without a WoT question, so in honor of Asmodean: What do you think would happen if Rand managed to hurl Padan Fain through the Bore into the Dark One's prison?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Dark One would spit him back out because he tastes bad.

In honor of Asmodean, I'll say that there is a mysterious death in
*The Way of Kings*
that could use some resources devoted to it. I did not put it in there simply because of Asmodean, but as I thought about it after writing it, I said, "Oh wow, I wonder if people will pick up on that." So there you go.
