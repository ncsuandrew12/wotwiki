# [Interview #585: Stormblessed.com Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=585#8)

#### Question

You've said that Shadesmar is the cognitive relam connecting all the worlds in the cosmere, and that Hoid is very good at using Shadesmar. Should we take this to mean Shadesmar is how he travels between the worlds? Do the other worlds have different ways of accessing Shadesmar than the way(s) the people of Roshar use?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
