# [Interview #585, Entry #1]: Stormblessed.com Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=585#1)

#### Steve Goedecke

Last month, even before he finished his hectic
*Towers of Midnight*
tour, Brandon Sanderson kindly agreed to answer some questions for us in an email interview. We got right to work on some fun and interesting questions—Copes helped to catalog issues that people were curious about from the forums—and narrowed the list down to some of the ones that seemed least likely to get RAFO'ed (a RAFO, in case you haven't seen the term before, is an answer of "Read and find out"). We still cut it pretty close on a few of them, and we appreciate Brandon doing his best to tell us something without giving too much away! Click "more" to read the full interview (both questions and answers are free of major
*The Way of Kings*
and Wheel of Time spoilers, for those still reading).
