#### Question

At the end of
*The Way of Kings*
, several key characters seem to be converging on the Shattered Plains.
*The Way of Kings*
takes place mainly on the Plains and Kharbranth. Do you plan to spend much time in new locations in book 2?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Book 2 will begin with Shallan and Jasnah either very close to or arriving at the Shattered Plains.
