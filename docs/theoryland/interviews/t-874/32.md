# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#32)

#### [Indigo Kae (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/indigokae/status/294188154733334528)

Is the woman who told Rand at the end that he was right to bring Moridin, Nakomi?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191054712889344)

I have been advised to RAFO questions regarding most everything from there on.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191171146764288)

It's funny to say RAFO when there is no more to read, but what that term means is "This is supposed to be ambiguous."

#### [David Catherine](https://twitter.com/DavidCatherine/status/294192437071593472)

With all of the homages to global myths/legends, is Nakomi the Wandering Jew/Jenn?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211090022268928)

That's a very clever question that nobody has yet asked me. I'm not going to say more, however.

#### [Ryan Lee](https://twitter.com/RyanCurtissLee/status/294190000801730560)

I gotta ask, is Nakomi / the Woman at the End a Shard of Adonalsium? Perhaps Balance?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294202997699919873)

No. There is not crossover between my shared world and the Wheel of Time. (Sorry.)

#### [kcf](https://twitter.com/nethspace/status/294191064212971520)

Who helped Rand out of the Shayol Ghul after the fight with the Dark One and told him he knew what he needed to do?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294206478208888832)

Hi, Neth. This is one I'm not answering, but if you track me down in person, you might be able to beat it out of me.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294199631074697218)

Is Nakomi the avatar of the Creator?

#### [Werthead](https://twitter.com/Werthead/status/294200152158253056)

SIFADFOE (Scream In Frustration And Don't Find Out, Ever) :-)

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294201242392072193)

Yay, that means I can officially not give a shit about Nakomi. :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215450898870272)

You are allowed that right officially. She's becoming the Asmodean kill of this sequence of books.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215564262522881)

I, of course, should have realized she'd become so big a thing as she did—but that wasn't the intention.

#### [Melissa Houghton](https://twitter.com/MissyHoughton/status/294188274388455426)

I want to know what the heck was with Nakomi—who/what she is. Also was that her at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191430992265216)

Just answered this. Have a look below. (Sorry. It's a RAFO, I'm afraid.)

#### [Peter Wikberg](https://twitter.com/wikberget/status/294188953186226176)

Who/What is Nakomi?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196661650092033)

That is a good question, but not one I'm planning to answer any time soon. (sorry.)

#### [Arran Cook](https://twitter.com/Arrannnn/status/294189315582484480)

Who was Nakomi? How did the body swap happen? How did Rand light the pipe?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198148539244544)

You've asked all three of the big questions I'm not allowed or unable to answer, I'm afraid.

#### [Lachie Stoller](https://twitter.com/Lachiestoller/status/294189319046963200)

Who was the old Aiel lady at the end of Rand's battle?

#### [James Starke](https://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294189559615463424)

Is Nakomi the person that Rand encountered at the mouth of Shayol Ghul? And is she the embodiment of The Creator?

#### [Brandon](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198339614941184) [Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294199718291054594)

This is one that I'm not answering, I'm afraid. RJ wanted some things about the ending to remain ambiguous.
