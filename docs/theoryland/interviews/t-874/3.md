# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#3)

#### [Anele (6 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/interneth3ro/status/288117355870048256)

Any info on when
*A Memory of Light*
will be available on iBooks?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288130814078758913)

It will be a few months, I'm afraid. Harriet's decision, not Tor's or mine.

#### [Kevin Williams](https://twitter.com/kevmatwill/status/288117066001702912)

Will
*A Memory of Light*
be on iBooks on the 8th?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288130970660532225)

No, I believe it is April. Harriet insisted. I tried to get it simultaneous. This was the compromise.

#### [Zach Burmeister (8 January)](https://twitter.com/ZBurmeister/status/288743908396126208)

Why such a delay for the ebook release?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288744566734069760)

Harriet is uncomfortable with ebooks. She wanted a year delay. We talked her into a few months.

#### [Zak Bryson](https://twitter.com/krispyfresh/status/288755083347365888)

Super annoyed that ebook versions of
*A Memory of Light*
don't come out until April 9th. Own all the other books in ebook form.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288756216300191744)

I wish it were our choice. Harriet insisted.

#### [Zoe M](https://twitter.com/Zoe_MM/status/288796677832331269)

Wow, anger about the ebook is brutalizing those Amazon ratings.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288797404298375168)

Always does. I wish they would realize Tor couldn't change this, nor could I.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288738906642448384)

*A Memory of Light*
is out today! Yay! On my way to the airport after a brief night's sleep. See some of you tonight in the Twin Cities.

#### [BJ Whitkin](https://twitter.com/Itsjustbeej/status/288801718223921152)

Really??? Then why isn't it on my Nook?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288801939729285120)

Harriet insisted it be delayed on ebook.

#### [BJ Whitkin](https://twitter.com/Itsjustbeej/status/288801946435997696)

Did anyone ask her why no ebook? Did she answer?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288802176707485696)

She is worried ebook sales would cause the hardcover to not sell enough to hit #1 on the bestseller lists.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288802260375441408)

I disagree, as does TOR, but it is her decision. Longer explanation on my blog tomorrow.

#### [Nick Timakondu](https://twitter.com/NickTimakondu/status/288820818522275840)

*A Memory of Light*
not available on Kindle until April? What a stupid decision.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288821230365204480)

I'm afraid my hands are tied. Harriet insisted.

#### [Lis Mitchell](https://twitter.com/Pixelfish/status/288955315788070913)

I have to say I didn't realize till this morning and was quite bummed. No more physical books get bought here.

#### [Rachel Reams](https://twitter.com/sunraven01/status/289078047481683969)

I also do not buy physical books any longer. Just found out no
*Memory of Light*
ebook and I'm disappointed.

@torbooks Please release
*A Memory of Light*
in electronic format. cc @BrandSanderson

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289091340803923968)

See the
[end of my blog post](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#7)
today. Nothing I can do, I'm afraid.

#### [Dylan Verheul](https://twitter.com/dyve/status/289099692703354880)

Thanks for your openness. This says "rankings are more important than readers", but your explanation helps.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289109377321930753)

Well, Harriet doesn't
*get*
ebooks. She thinks they're like paperbacks. She figures if paperback readers will wait, why not ebook readers?

#### [tkm222 (13 January)](https://twitter.com/tkm222/status/290621630177234945)

Just read about reasons for no ebook... There are now illegal copies everywhere... I am waiting to buy but am very disappointed.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290639999865585664)

I am very sorry. Wish I could do more.

#### [E-R (14 January)](http://twitter.com/Opt1mus1980/status/290920681581973504)

Any idea when the Kindle or Nook edition of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290934114348056577)

April. (Explanation on my website. Terribly sorry about the delay.)
