Are Mat and Perrin still
*ta'veren*
after the Last Battle?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203828000133122)

That is an excellent question...that I'm not allowed to answer. (Sorry.) I feel bad. I'm giving you lots of RAFOs.

Is Rand still
*ta'veren*
? If not, how did he warp reality and light his pipe at the end?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207601707724800)

These are questions that I'm not answering, I'm afraid. RJ wanted some things about the ending to remain ambiguous.

#### [Mike W](https://twitter.com/paxeternus/status/294191571551797251)

How can you still be RAFO'ing stuff? What is left to read?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208505773174784)

To RJ, RAFO sometimes meant "Read, think about it, and decide." It didn't always mean "I'll give an answer."

#### [Peter Binkowski](https://twitter.com/peterbinks/status/294191774337990656)

Is 'RAFO' basically to mean we're never going to find some things out?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209176907968513)

There's a "Talk it over, see if you can figure it out" aspect to it as well.
