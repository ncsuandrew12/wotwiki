Don't you feel some of the character endings were too rushed (Fain, everyone Demandred killed)?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190444575858689)

Finishing everything that RJ left to be finished in the amount of space required results in some dynamic pacing.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190524041134080)

I don't feel rushed is the right term. But I can see how people might feel that way. I could have gone three more books.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190653108269057)

It was not right to do so. This was what he wanted, and I did my best to fit everything in. I'm pleased with the result.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190783106539520)

In regards to your specific questions, the Demandred kills were supposed to be abrupt to convey emotion of sudden loss.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190893634818048)

That's how things are in war. As for Fain, a piece of me does wish there had been time for more with him.

Do you plan on expanding on the Wheel of Time series more or is it done? Why did you have so many abrupt deaths?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205868482908161)

No, no more. RJ wouldn't want it. Abrupt deaths happen in war; it is the way this sort of thing plays out, I'm afraid.

Was there anything in
*A Memory of Light*
you wished you could have changed?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212202234253312)

I might have done more with Fain if I'd had the time and the pages.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212287856791552)

The biggest challenge for the book was fitting everyone in, and making sure they had relevant things to do.
