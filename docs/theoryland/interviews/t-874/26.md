I notice that Rand referred to Moridin as "Elan," not "Elan Morin." Why that stylistic choice?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294189396670963712)

Rand didn't think he deserved the third name.

But Elan Morin were his two names, like Lews Therin. Tedronai was his third name.

Speaking as Rand does was an intentional insult, as per my understanding via the notes.

I saw it as a familiarity, since he calls Ilyena by her first name only. Well, so does everyone...(she has three).

I view it this way, but it might be colored by my own personal experience. In Korea, using a very familial tone...

...is either endearing or incredibly offensive, depending on your relationship to the person. That's how I see it here.

At times, honestly, I don't know if Rand is intending insult or familiarity—perhaps both.
