Okay, so I went an hour and 45 minutes and Still have over 500 questions. I'm sorry to cut the #torchat off here. :(

We just received word that
*A Memory of Light*
is #1 on the
*New York Times*
list for the second week in a row. Wow!

It would be easy to keep going for the next six hours, but I don't have the time. I'll do more Q&A sessions in the next few weeks. #torchat

For now, we'll get the transcript of this up, and maybe you'll find that someone else asked your question. Thanks, all! #torchat
