# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#28)

So I always wondered... what ever happened to the Tinkers' song? Did I miss a resolution to that arc?

By specific instruction from RJ, the Tinkers have not found their song as of the end of
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294189928173162498)

The song of growing is not their "Song." The Song is a much more deep and philosophical concept, perhaps unattainable.

Do you imagine that Rand teaches "the song" to the Tu'athan after the events of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191869288673280)

Rand does not know The Song. Anything he'd try to teach them, they would not accept as The Song.

#### [Aaron Oster](https://twitter.com/TheAOster/status/294190111845916672)

Wait, are you saying Rand's song that Mat recognized wasn't the Tinkers' song?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203638291787776)

The Tinker "Song" is an ideal that goes far beyond any song that has actually ever existed.
