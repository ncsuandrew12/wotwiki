# [Interview #874, Entry #54]: Twitter 2013 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#54)

Did Demandred take over just a single faction of Sharans, or all of them?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210120005595136)

Multiple factions, but not all by a long shot.

Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't RJ say in a interview that Shara wouldn't be involved in any of the WoT books?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203502966734848)

The quotes I've seen say that nothing significant would happen there on screen.

#### Footnote

Brandon is correct; RJ never said that Shara would play no role at all, just that the story would travel to Shara itself for more than a brief visit comparable to Rand's and Aviendha's trip to Seanchan.
