Is Gaidal Cain, Grady's kid, Gadren?

That's a good theory. Some fans think he would be too old, however. What do you think?

#### Footnote

According to RJ's
[comments](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#23)
on the subject, he is too old; Rand thought he was about four years old in
*Lord of Chaos*
, and even if Rand was off, Gaidal can't have been any more than two months old at the time, and was more likely just being born. It stretches credulity that Rand would have mistaken a newborn baby for a four-year-old child.
