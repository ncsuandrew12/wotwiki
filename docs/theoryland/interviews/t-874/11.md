@Terez27 Do we know which character is
[dead by Harriet's choice](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#17)
?

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/290539142599827456)

Bela. @BrandSanderson
[told us](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#39)
[twice](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#26)
that she would survive. :( But apparently Harriet later insisted she should die.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290549706852028416)

Yeah. Harriet felt that we had painted that character into a corner, and the story demanded that conclusion.

#### [Daniel Shepard](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/290555796650090498)

Is that the
[GRRM moment](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#27)
? Or the character that was gonna recover from their injuries?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290556875982917632)

Character was going to recover.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290549958736752641)

She was right to make that call, but it does turn me into a liar. That's what I get for speaking too soon...

#### [Werthead](https://twitter.com/Werthead/status/290567025439432704)

That does seem slightly ludicrous. I think the fanbase turned Bela into a bit of a meme.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290567504508633090)

True, but I will note that Harriet personally has a special fondness for her.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290567799355629568)

She has said that she would joke with RJ that Bela was the character based on Harriet in the books.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290576171962351617)

Harriet even has "Bela" in her email address. She took her fate quite seriously.

#### [Werthead](https://twitter.com/Werthead/status/290567175205421056)

The average reader wouldn't even remember who she was. Weird this much effort was spent on her.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290575493856641027)

You think? Back when I was an average reader and hadn't talked about the books online, I loved Bela.
