# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#10)

Any chance of finding out what "Bao" or "The Wyld" mean since we have no glossary?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290306967061270528)

Both are a reference to Beowulf, and I meant the Wyld to mean "predator" or, in more common tongue, he who will kill the dragon.

#### Footnote

The name "Bao" also came from Bao Pham, a fan who has worked (along with Jimmy Liang, blademaster "Jaim" of The Yearly Brawl) teaching sword forms for JordanCon and the WoT track at DragonCon.
