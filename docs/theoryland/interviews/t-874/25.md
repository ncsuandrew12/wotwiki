# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#25)

With all the deaths that occurred in
*A Memory of Light*
, were there any that hit you harder than any others?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294188996983156736)

Egwene. After that, Bela. I'd promised she would live, but Harriet decided that I was cheating to keep her alive.

How long did it take you to write Egwene's death? What were your emotions then? How much had RJ written of it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207875935502337)

It was a hard one, to be sure. Hardest in the books. Had a long conversation with Team Jordan about how to manage it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207924702703617)

RJ had not written much of that sequence.

Why did Egwene have to die? Very sad.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294199986730704897)

I agree. But if you look at the arc of her character, you might begin to see why it was important.

Without spoilers, were there any characters you want to kill/save that you couldn't do to Jordan's wishes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196450655625216)

There was one. But it was Harriet's call, not RJ's, that ended them.

#### [Bellygod](https://twitter.com/Bellygod0607/status/294189008181944321)

Who did you find hardest to kill?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294197173275463680)

Egwene by a mile. Followed by Bela.

#### [Bellygod](https://twitter.com/Bellygod0607/status/294190813167099904)

Why did you kill Bela?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205146043396096)

I tried to keep her alive! Harriet told me I'd put her in too bad a situation, and she needed to die.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205181602701312)

She was right, of course, but it still hurts.
