# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#30)

#### [Alexi (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Fatal_Romantic/status/294188116279959552)

Is there a possibility of a new series focusing on the Seanchan?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190187829927938)

Afraid not. RJ did not leave notes about that series, and we feel that to do it would be exploiting his legacy.

#### [Keith Martin](https://twitter.com/kam2112/status/294189396792578049)

Do you think you might revisit WoT to continue some of the stories left untold?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198708613050368)

No. It is very unlikely. I feel that from here out, writing in the WoT world would be against RJ's wishes.

#### [Jade Kazmierski](https://twitter.com/jadekaz/status/294189640968196097)

I understand the series as it were is complete, but is there any chance for further novellas?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294200098357919744)

Unlikely. I don't believe that RJ would want us to do that.

#### [Marcel Stokvis](https://twitter.com/MarcelStokvis/status/294190028148596736)

Will you be finishing the prequels as well?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203371756347393)

Unlikely. I don't think RJ would want me to.

#### [Henry Koivuneva](https://twitter.com/hkoivuneva/status/294190632266780672)

Rereading the series, what is your opinion, could more books be written on the Fourth Age?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204561814597632)

Yes, many could—but they would be our projections, not RJ's vision. So we shouldn't do them.

#### [Neil Ritchie](https://twitter.com/Neiley83/status/294192576016293888)

Is this the absolute end? Darkfriends must still exist and the future is very unclear. Seems scope for more?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211874738798592)

It is not the end, but it is the end of what we will write. The rest is left to fan imaginations.
