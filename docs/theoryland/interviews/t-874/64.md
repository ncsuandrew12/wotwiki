Was wondering why the ending there was no conversation between Hawking and Tuon.

You're assuming because it wasn't shown on screen, it didn't happen...

What happened in the conversation between Tuon and Arthur Hawkwing?!?!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208578254938112)

It was interesting, I'll tell you that much.

Did Hawkwing talk with Tuon?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210792918753280)

Yes.

#### [Nick](https://twitter.com/ampsonic/status/294192561684373504)

How do you think Fortuona reacted to speaking with Hawking?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211553153138689)

With great consternation.
