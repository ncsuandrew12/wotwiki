At 11:52 PM on 11/6/13, I finished reading The Wheel of Time. To Robert Jordan, you, and all of team Jordan...Thank you.

It has been an honor. The epilogue as it stands now is the sequence I read 5 years ago—the last part that RJ left for us.

#### Footnote

This was clarified
[elsewhere](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#9)
. RJ didn't write the entire epilogue, but it's implied he wrote most of it, and certainly the Rand POVs at the end (this was RJ's 'last scene').
