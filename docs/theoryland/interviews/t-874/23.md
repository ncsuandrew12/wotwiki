Brandon, does the Oath Rod continue to be used in the Fourth Age? If so, for what purpose?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294188467477413888)

So far as I know, yes. And for the same purpose.

#### [Raj Iyer](https://twitter.com/iyer5/status/294188838807535616)

Do other groups start using the Rod too?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196013562986496)

Do you think the Aes Sedai are likely to let others manhandle one of their
*ter'angreal*
?

#### [Kamarile Sedai](https://twitter.com/AmyrlinEgwene/status/294188877873295361)

Did men start to use the Oath Rod too, or did it continue to be only women?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196202050818048)

No men. Neither group would like that. The Asha'man are NOT male Aes Sedai. RJ was clear about this in the notes.

#### [Keith Martin](https://twitter.com/kam2112/status/294190407976366083)

Will the White and Black Towers reunite to form one Aes Sedai again?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204009101807616)

RJ was clear to me that the Asha'man were not Aes Sedai, and were not going to become them.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204076424572928)

That said, a united male/female Aes Sedai will come again someday.

#### Footnote

Brandon is probably not referring to the 4th Age in his last tweet; more likely he's talking about the next turning of the Wheel.
