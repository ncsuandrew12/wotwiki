# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#29)

Okay, the pipe lighting . . . Any real explanation, or are we just going to wonder forever?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190059639427072)

I put it in as RJ instructed, and I know nothing more about it than fandom does, I'm afraid.

#### [James Starke](http://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294188328499150848)

Popular theory is that from his time with the Dark One/Creator/Pattern, he's able to manipulate The Pattern a bit.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191921298026497)

This is a good theory.

What's your opinion on how pipe lighting was or could have been done even if we don't have RJ's answer?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294205006062698496)

Ha. I agree with some of the fan discussions.

#### [Andrew Mudge](https://twitter.com/AndrewMudge/status/294192341282074625)

Is Rand the missing link between the Pattern and the Creator himself, possibly even the balancer of light/dark?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210595413168129)

That's one possible theory.

How did Rand light the pipe at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294192066588712960)

I know no more on this than fandom does, I'm afraid. RJ did not explain.

#### [Terry Benton](https://twitter.com/terrybenton/status/294188518782169088)

I still can't figure it out...how did Rand light his pipe? Is he in
*Tel'aran'rhioid*
? Is everybody??

#### [Dan Zambito](https://twitter.com/Historytechbito/status/294188658553135104)

Can you explain how Rand lit his pipe in the last scene? Did he discover a new power? Is he a new power?

#### [Brandon](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294193167580942336) [Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294195610494582784)

I'm afraid I don't know anything more than fandom does about this. RJ did not leave notes on the matter.
