[#torchat](http://torforge.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/january-torchat-lineup-revealed/)
here on Twitter.

@fionwe1987 (question about spoilers) @tordotcom That's a good question. Thoughts, Tor? Should I post a spoiler warning on all of this? Probably better to do so.

I'm starting #torchat. Tweet me your questions with that tag. SPOILERS ALLOWED. So don't watch if you haven't finished
*A Memory of Light*
.

Warning, I don't have time to look up of things in the notes during this, so I will frequently MAFO very detailed world questions.

Please do remember the hashtag. Also, I'll try to @ people directly to not flood your Twitter streams, so search for #torchat to watch.
