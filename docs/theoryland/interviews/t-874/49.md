Bloody ashes man, how does Mat go from "together they died" to walking away?!

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294201007741743104)

The "together" does not include Mat.

#### Footnote

The passage in question spoke of Fain and Mordeth as separate entities.
