# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#36)

Great structure from @BrandSanderson, by the way. The book required you break normal structural rules in just the right way. Great work.

Thanks, Bob. You rock.

So what kind of prewriting did you do for
*A Memory of Light*
@BrandSanderson?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294195744112517122)

Lots of practicing character viewpoints. I also make a huge outline, which started on big sheets of butcher paper.

Is there anything specific process-wise you learned from completing WoT that you will apply to future projects?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210689340436482)

I'm in awe of RJ's subtlety and hope to be able to transfer my understanding of that to my own works.

Did the ending of
*A Memory of Light*
influence the end of
*Emperor's Soul*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191586911334400)

Not intentionally, but it's hard not to be influenced by projects like this.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191708873310209)

For example, I wrote
*Rithmatist*
while developing the revision for
*The Way of Kings*
, and both ended up with a redhead artist.

#### [Brent Holmes](https://twitter.com/BrentAtGazette/status/294192496215486464)

Did the confrontation between Vin and Ruin in
*Hero of Ages*
influence the Rand v Dark One scenes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211256200617984)

Everything I do influences everything else, so I'd say yes—but in this case, I had RJ guiding me as a greater influence.

#### [Simon Ponder](https://twitter.com/lenire/status/294190621302853633)

How does it feel now that the Wheel of Time is over?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204442742513664)

Sad. Awesome, but sad.

#### [Chris from Jax](https://twitter.com/ckiernan99/status/294192657960419329)

Is it tough knowing you can't continue the story?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212090036633600)

Yes, and no. I feel the ending is the right one. And I can imagine in my head what happens, so for me, that is enough.
