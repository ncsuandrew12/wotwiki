# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#39)

#### [Aaron Oster (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/TheAOster/status/294188605818150914)

If, hypothetically, there was a body switch in WoT, how would it happen? Would it be an actual switch or illusion?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294194284054315009)

There are far more reasons, worldbuilding wise, to believe it was real than to believe it was illusion.

Is Rand's soul in Moridin's body?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294197597407698944)

Ha. Right to the point, are you? Let's just say that trickery is not likely in this case.

#### [TJ](https://twitter.com/Cyan220/status/294192684925603840)

Can you confirm that Rand's body was burned at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294212501393006593)

Okay, fine. Yes, I will confirm that Rand's body was indeed the one that was burned. :)

#### [Jonathan MacAlpine](https://twitter.com/apocriva/status/294191658122240002)

Why didn't anybody notice when a supposedly-dead Moridin got up and walked away?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294209086491332609)

I'd say coincidence. But there aren't many of those in the WoT world.

#### [Siraaj](https://twitter.com/siraaj/status/294191133075070977)

Seems like a conversation between the Creator and Rand was missing where "switch" and Alivia's role in it are laid out—thoughts?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207520308854784)

I believe that RJ included everything he wanted in this sequence.

#### [Jason Cassidy](https://twitter.com/jaybone1978/status/294189990060118017)

Why did Rand switch bodies at the end and why is he going incognito now? Did not understand that part.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294202910710054912)

RJ wrote these scenes, and intended to leave them as is. I don't think me delving into explanations is what he'd want.

#### [El Brian](https://twitter.com/El_Brian/status/294189325938216960)

Did the bonding between Rand, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Min transfer over to the new body?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294198504996352000)

Yes, though I don't know how or why.

#### [Kamarile Sedai](https://twitter.com/AmyrlinEgwene/status/294190127251587073)

Why did the bond survive the body switch at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203714208669699)

I don't know. RJ did not explain this one to me.

#### [J Crosby](https://twitter.com/Xolsiion/status/294190453912371200)

How were Rand/Elan able to switch bodies?

#### [Sean Duffy](https://twitter.com/kqrpnb/status/294191502031216640)

How did Rand wind up with Moridin's body?

#### [James Starke](https://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294192889825751041)

Could you explain further about the body switch and how it was possible?

#### [Brandon](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204180200050691) [Sander](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208237388042240) [son](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294213565861199872)

This is one that I'm not answering, I'm afraid. RJ wanted some things about the ending to remain ambiguous.
