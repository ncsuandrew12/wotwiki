# [Interview #874: Twitter 2013 (WoT), Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#33)

#### [Kirsten Gesenberg (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/SUNNYCR0W/status/294188315891097600)

Which scene is the "last scene" that RJ said he wrote first?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294191758324154368)

Pipe scene.

#### Footnote

RJ always said he
*could*
have written the scene in 1984, but he
[didn't actually write it](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#13)
until he was working on
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [James Starke](https://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/294188553234169856)

Robert Jordan wrote the entire epilogue.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294193957720698881)

Almost all. There were a few small inserts by me. Perrin was mine in the epilogue.

#### [Mike Cox](https://twitter.com/Mikecox20/status/294190007906873344)

I would like to know, how much of the last chapter was written by RJ and how much did you do?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203184098967552)

I did Perrin and some of the in-between writing with Loial. RJ did Mat, Rand, scene exiting the mountain, and others.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294203285911519232)

There are places where I tweaked bits, per editing, and places where I slipped in things he'd written to my sequences.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/294200837700481024)

Was the last scene written or dictated?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294215896157806592)

Written down. As was the scene with Isam [in] the prologue.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294216006199558144)

The Borderlander tower scene was dictated, I believe.
