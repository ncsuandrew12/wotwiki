Did Rand's third question to the Aelfinn involve whether/how the Dark One could be killed?

I think Maria and Harriet are planning to put these in the encyclopedia, but you are right on the third question.

#### [Peter Wikberg](https://twitter.com/wikberget/status/294190914715410434)

What did Moiraine ask Aelfinn/Eelfinn?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294206033251954688)

Ooh, good question. And one I don't have the answer to that handy, but we can MAFO that and ask Maria.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=7900)

Everything I know about Aelfinn/Eelfinn questions/wishes will be in the encyclopedia.
