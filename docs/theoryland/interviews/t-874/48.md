Which character was easiest to write and who was the hardest?

Easiest: Perrin. Hardest: Mat. Followed by Aviendha and Tuon.

Now that you're finished, what was your favorite scene to write? Character?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211345879007232)

Perrin, and the forging of his hammer. In
*A Memory of Light*
it was the sequence with Lan near the end.

What character was most difficult to write for?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211983841054721)

Mat was the most difficult for me to get right.

#### [Jacob Corbin](https://twitter.com/Corbinzsky/status/294191425250271233)

The Rand and Mat dialogue where they try to one up each other was amazing. Thank you for that (and the whole book).

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208147759972352)

That scene was one of my favorites to work on.

What was the most shocking thing you learned when first reading RJ's notes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294204372869582848)

Verin.
