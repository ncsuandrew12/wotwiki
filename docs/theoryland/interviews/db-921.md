## Entry #1

#### David Given

Chase and I arrived around 6:45 for a 7:00 signing. Standing room only—seats had been full since 5:00 according to some. Chatted with the crew, had some laughs, drank coffee.

Employee announcement—Rules Change! First time through the line sign three books w/Brandon & Harriet, second time through the line Brandon will personalize books—Harriett is going to leave.

Memory Keepers in red shirts roll in & tell us not to ask spoiler questions.

Brandon & Harriett arrive all smiles & waves. Brandon reviews the rules @ Spoilers and describes the photo bombing strategy. Show of hands for how many have not finished—about half.

Questions—lots of fairly good ones about the writing process—several Brandon asks the person to follow up with him in line because of spoilers. Retells the story of getting the Call from Harriett. Questions about Zany Magic Systems . Nice plugs for what he is working on. Harriett does a Jordan imitation, talks about where she saw herself in the book, and editing in general. Brandon says WoT and Ender's Game are the two most important books of our Generation. Question period lasted about 30 minutes & ended with an Amazing Harriett read of what Brandon called the Wind Paragraph:

"The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an age long pass, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning."

...which was great.

Lines were very long—store was packed. Signing was non eventful.

Overall a very fun Thursday night.

The only picture I took was of some Legos that I played with while waiting in line.
