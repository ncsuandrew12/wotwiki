# [Interview #478: TGS Signing Report - forkroot, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=478#3)

#### forkroot

My first question pertained to whether there was a mistake in the text when Joline is negotiating horse counts with Matâ€”did she overlook her Warders?

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS looked surprised and said that if indeed the text didn't account for them that it was a mistake as Joline would not have forgotten them.

#### Footnote

This was corrected for later editions.
