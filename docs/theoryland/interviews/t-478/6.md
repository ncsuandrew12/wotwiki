# [Interview #478: TGS Signing Report - forkroot, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=478#6)

OK, It's been said before, but I have to say it again. We WoT fans are fantastically lucky that Brandon was chosen to complete the series. This guy has obvious reverence for WoT, the necessary skills as a writer, and an almost fanatic devotion to "keeping it RJ's story". Plus he's just a great guy.

Given that he's been so generous with his time to us the fans, I'd like to make a quick shout out now for one of his cause celebres that he mentioned at the end of his group address: He made a plea for us to support independent booksellers (brick and mortar places). He pointed out that things like the signing certainly can't happen if all of the books are sold on-line.

So if you can't meet him at one of his signings but want to say "Thank You" in your own way, then go buy one of his books at your local independent bookseller!

Oops—so much for being brief. I'll follow up after Samadai if there are any loose ends to chase.

Oh yeah—one more thing...Portland needs to run their Red Line trains a little later. Cab fare was expensive!
