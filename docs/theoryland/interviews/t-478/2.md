# [Interview #478: TGS Signing Report - forkroot, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=478#2)

#### forkroot

Samadai had an early number so he went up and got his books signed. Due to my late arrival, my number was near the end. I made a huge mistake though: Obviously I didn't have my copy of
*The Gathering Storm*
with me, but I was planning to buy
*Warbreaker*
and have BWS sign that. Should have snagged and held a copy; instead I waited until my turn in line only to realize that all the copies were gone. So I picked up a couple of the
*Alcatraz*
books and Brandon signed those.

By now you should have expected that Brandon would be polite, patient, witty, engaging and an all-around good guy. And he was all of that. I guess what really stands out about him is his consideration for other people.

As was the case in San Diego, Brandon agreed to stay late to address the questions but asked that we do it outside the bookstore since they would like to close up. Samadai had gathered the list of questions that you all had requested, and Brandon answered them patiently and thoughtfully.

I won't steal Samadai's thunder on those answers, but I will give you the answers to the two questions that I asked.
