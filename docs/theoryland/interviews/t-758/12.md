# [Interview #758: ABC Interview: Why Brandon Sanderson Took on the Wheel of Time, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=758#12)

#### Michael Cathcart

Now, you also teach fantasy writing, I gather.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do. I took over the class at Brigham Young University—it's just the one class; I only teach it once a year—but it felt important to me when the other author who was teaching it retired that it still continued going, because it had been part of what helped a lot of new writers in this genre get their start. And so I've been teaching it for eight or nine years now; I took it over right after the other author retired.

#### Michael Cathcart

So that's one class a year, is it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep, one class a year. I'm as little a professor as one can be and still perhaps have the title. One class a year, one night a week, and even then I miss it several times a semester because I'm off touring doing things like this. I actually missed my finals on Saturday; I had to have my TA go collect finals for me because I was in Australia.

#### Michael Cathcart

I think you're a borderline professor. [laughter]
