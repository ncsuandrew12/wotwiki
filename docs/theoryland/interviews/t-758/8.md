# [Interview #758: ABC Interview: Why Brandon Sanderson Took on the Wheel of Time, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=758#8)

#### Michael Cathcart

This is Books and Arts Daily on RN, and my guest is the prolific American fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson, and we're talking to him because he took on the formidable task of completing another man's work. He's completed the Wheel of Time series, which of course is the work of Robert Jordan who died before he could finish.
