# [Interview #758: ABC Interview: Why Brandon Sanderson Took on the Wheel of Time, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=758#2)

#### Michael Cathcart

This is Books and Arts Daily on RN with Michael Cathcart, and we're going to look now at fantasy. You'd have to say that writing your own novel isn't an easy feat, but imagine trying to finish someone else's story. Brandon Sanderson is a prolific American fantasy writer; in fact he's the author of ten novels and we're still counting. Five years ago, he agreed to add to his workload and finish Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series, The Wheel of Time. Robert Jordan was in the middle of writing the twelfth and supposedly final book in the series when he died. That was in 2007. Well, Brandon is a lifelong fan of Robert's work, and he agreed to finish the book. In fact, he's turned it into a trilogy. He's already finished two of that trilogy—two books in that trilogy—and they topped the
*New York Times*
best-seller list, so he must have done a good job. He's now working on the third and final installment, and he joins us now from our Sydney studio. Brandon, welcome to Books and Arts Daily.

Thank you very much, Michael.
