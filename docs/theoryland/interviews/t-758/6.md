# [Interview #758, Entry #6]: ABC Interview: Why Brandon Sanderson Took on the Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=758#6)

#### Michael Cathcart

So when you came to write [RJ's] work, essentially, did you try to enter into his style in those respects, or did you maintain your own convictions, I guess?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's an excellent question, and it's one that I wrestled with for a long time. I worried. . . Eventually, I did actually try a few things, that I was just trying to imitate him, and I worried I would just come off as parody, honestly. And that was a big worry for me. At the end of the day I decided that what I needed to do was to get the voices right for the characters. Robert Jordan writes a very intense third person limited, where each line is colored by the vision of the character he's writing for at the moment.

And I felt that if I could get the souls of the characters right, even if I were coming in and doing it stylistically a little bit differently, the books would still
*feel*
right, if that makes any sense. And that became my goal and my quest: get the characters' souls to feel right. I often use the metaphor, I say it's like you're watching a television series, and the director changes—the actors are still the same, but the director changes—and that's what I was going for.

#### Michael Cathcart

It's a hard core, though, isn't it? I mean, Wheel of Time fans are very,
*very*
hard-core...

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are.

#### Michael Cathcart

...and (laughs) I wondered whether any of them had misgivings about you stepping in this way.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I got a great deal of email. My inbox flooded as soon as I was announced. And there was really no justification I could give. All I could say is, "Well, wait until the book comes out. Let's see what I can do. If it stands up on its own, then that's the best proof I can give, and nothing I can say earlier will do a better job of that. If it falls down, then no justification I give now will mean anything anyway." And so I just focused on the writing and trying to get the book out and, you know, trying to....a real challenge was making sure that it fulfilled
*his*
vision for the series, and not mine, because I was a fan, and sometimes you can let that inner fan take over, and that can be a bad thing for a story. You want the story to have power and emotion; you don't want it to be a big list of inside jokes.
