# [Interview #758: ABC Interview: Why Brandon Sanderson Took on the Wheel of Time, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=758#3)

#### Michael Cathcart

Now, you're a successful writer in your own right. Why did you want to finish someone else's work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I started reading Robert Jordan when I was fifteen, right at the beginning, when his books started coming out in the Wheel of Time. And, life-long fan. I mean, they inspired me, they're part of what made me want to be a writer, and I've always loved them. And so when this chance came at me, it wasn't something I could pass up. It wasn't something I was expecting. It wasn't something I had applied for. But when the phone call came, I just couldn't say no. Just imagine some little kid that I was when I was reading these books, and the imagination of them, and what they inspired me to become. And then, later on, kind of being able to help out in the last books, it's just...it's amazing.

#### Michael Cathcart

I totally get this. You know, I feel that about working on this radio station. This radio station I've worked for all my life, suddenly I have the fun of being on it. I can never quite get over it. Every day the red light goes on, I think, "Oh, this is great!"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah, that happens to me. I think, "What am I doing? I'm working on the Wheel of Time?" You know, these characters I grew up with, that in many ways were my high school buddies? Now I'm telling their story. It's mind-blowing.
