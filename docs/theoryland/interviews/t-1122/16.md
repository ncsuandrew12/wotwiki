The Dark Souls series, I started on Demon Souls when it was actually hard, but I like them all. I like the level design, I like that they’re not coddling you. I’ve always loved the Civilization games, I play those quite extensively. In fact when I was in college I spent many a long night in my friends room playing Civilization, until he was like “Go to bed”. I just played Skyrim, i tend to wait a few years on those games so I can get mods and things l like. I thought Skyrim was the best of the Elder Scrolls games, I’ve played them all since Daggerfall and they fixed a lot of the problems like the leveling was always bad and some of the dungeon designs were so repetitive. This one they fixed all that and I had a blast.
