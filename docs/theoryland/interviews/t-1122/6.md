# [Interview #1122: Central Library, Seattle, WA, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1122#6)

#### WeiryWriter

So I know your kids are probably too young to have read your books but are they familiar with your characters and if so do they have favorites?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re not familiar with my characters, 7, 5, and 2. The seven-year-old is getting old enough that I could read him books, but I don’t want to read him my books first. I want him to read stuff like Dragon’s Blood by Jane Yolen or something. We’ll let him read my books if he wants to. I remember I was reading an interview with Tad Williams once and he said “People ask, you’re a famous author, how do you stay humble” and he said “Well the other day we all went out as a family because I finished a book. And my son said ‘What’s the celebration?’ and I said ‘Well I finished my book’ and my son said ‘That’s a good job, finishing reading a book.’”
