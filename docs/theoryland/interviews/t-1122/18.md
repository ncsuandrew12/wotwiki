#### Question

My other question is about the phrase “Shadows of Self”. It’s mentioned in the last Mistborn book [...] so are we ever going to see the shadows in Shadows of Self?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We are not going-- Well yes and no. What it is referencing in this book is the different roles that each person plays in their life. That is the core meaning of Shadows of Self. But there is also, there is a kandra involved, which they change shape and become different people, so “who are you?” and identity is a big thing.
