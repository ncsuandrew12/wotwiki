#### WeiryWriter

I really like Alloy of Law, do you see yourself making anymore of those in-universe novellas? [...]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I do see myself doing many more novellas. I enjoy the process, it helps me get stories out of my brain that are itching at me without having to start another 7 book series or whatever. What I reading to you tonight is from a novella but it is not cosmere. Though I do have several more cosmere novellas going. [discussion on currently released novellas and where to find them] Iâ€™m planning to do many more, I really enjoy it. I think short fiction is fun and exciting-- short for me.
