So my friend wanted me to ask you, after we both read Firefight, is there anything you can say about Instabam? Powers or anything.

#### Brandon Sanderson

See facetiously in my head I had Instabam have power over instant potatoes, but I’m probably not going to do that. But that is what I had in my head when I wrote that name. Yeah, instant potatoes “Poom” can cook food at the snap of fingers. I don’t know what their powers are. I didn’t work that out. You can say instant potatoes if you want.
