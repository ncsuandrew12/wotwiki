#### Question

What is a sparkflicker and what is it used for?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh good question, are you 17th Shard as well? You’ll be interested in this. Sparkflickers are [...] Herdazians, their fingernails are stone. A sparkflicker is so they can start fires. They’re actually flint-and-steel-ing. So it’s a fire-maker using their actual fingernails.

#### Question

So they don’t have a martial application?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really [... males yes if your fingernails are rough]. but there is a deep implication to that that I don’t think people have picked out yet.
