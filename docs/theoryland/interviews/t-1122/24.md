# [Interview #1122: Central Library, Seattle, WA, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1122#24)

#### Question

Is Investiture universal? By that I mean, if an Allomancer got Stormlight somehow could they use that to fuel Allomancy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is always possible, so yes. But in some case it requires some quote-unquote hacking, like an AC vs a DC current or we’ve got a 120 Volt and they’ve got 240. [...] I guess hacking is the wrong term, adapters.
