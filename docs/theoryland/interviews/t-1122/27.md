#### Question

Do Allomantic Pushes and Pulls generate friction?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So… \*sigh\* I’ve had to ask myself this because if they didn’t generate friction certain things that I do in the books wouldn’t happen. I assume if you’ve seen the physics of it you’ve noticed.
I have to go with-- Yes but the physics of it I’m a little wishy-washy on. I mean it’s pretty obvious from the way I do things that they do.
You have? You’ve seen the science of it, you Push things up in midair. If they didn’t two Allomancers couldn’t both push on a coin and hold it in place, but it does get held in place.
I do have to say that Peter is going to break his brain trying to figure out how that works. But it’s canon, I put it in the books so it’s not like we can just ignore the fact.

#### Footnote

Questioner's comment: Yes, I’ve won a 17 page argument.
