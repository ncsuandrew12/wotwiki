#### Question

So with the cosmere, do you come up with stories and see if they fit? Or does the cosmere lend itself to stories already?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s mostly the first. [...] When I come up with a story I’ll ask, “Does this fit the cosmere?” and if not [...] I don’t want to be doing far-future science fiction stuff in the cosmere, yet [...] Or the Rithmatist which I bounced back and forth with, I eventually decided it just didn’t fit the story. If things do fit, I put them in.

#### Question

Is that a really exciting moment[when things fit]? Or…

#### Brandon Sanderson

)No, it’s just nice. I like all my stories. The cosmere-- Part of my rules for myself is “The cosmere is not my entire body of work” because then I would try to shoehorn more things in and I’ve found sometimes when authors create a multiverse they shoehorn everything in. Stephen King did this, [Asimov] it doesn’t work. I think if it is a deliberate thing I'm intentionally doing, then it gains more cooler than if I tried to make everything connected.
