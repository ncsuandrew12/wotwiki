Also is there any reason why you are looking at doing Mistborn in the 40’s?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Just because I want to see-- It’s where I feel excited by a story and if I go all the way to the 80’s, which I’m going to do eventually, we lose the Age of Exploration, my last shots at it. I think in the 40’s we could still have a shot at Age of exploration even though it’s well past that, you know what I mean? [...] but by 80’s they’re launching satellites, right? The world is known. So if I want to do one more thing before then I could do-- The thing about the Mistborn world is that it is mostly uninhabited. It’s like an Earth-sized planet but most of the continents have no people. that’s really exciting from a storytelling aspect.
