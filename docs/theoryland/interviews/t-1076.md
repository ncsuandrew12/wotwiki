## [Entry #1](./t-1076/1)

#### Question

Who are the 5 main characters from the first half of The Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kaladin, Shallan, Szeth, Eshonai, Dalinar in that order.

## [Entry #2](./t-1076/2)

#### Question

When are we going to get Hoid’s book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid has 6 books, they are the 3 books of Dragonsteel, which are prequels and the last Mistborn trilogy of the nine book arc will have him as a main character.

## [Entry #3](./t-1076/3)

#### Question

What powers does [Hoid] have, what magics is he using?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you watch in these books, he has used on screen so far three of the different magics?

#### Question

Have we seen those three, do we know what those three are?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know at least two of them. More obvious clues are in [
*Words of Radiance*
]. Watch where he and Kaladin have some interactions. Watch carefully, you will see something in what he mentions. You've seen him and Shallan, that scene in one of her flashbacks, in that scene he uses one if you watch.

## [Entry #4](./t-1076/4)

#### Question

I was interested in the implications of Gaz coming back.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Gaz was always planned to come back. Which is why there's kind of a mystery to him in the first book, like where did he go? It's something Robert Jordan did that I liked.

## [Entry #5](./t-1076/5)

#### Question

Do you know how you're going to write how Hoid goes between worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I do. There is a big clue in
*Words of Radiance*
. There is a very big clue in the very first book I published.

## [Entry #6](./t-1076/6)

#### Question

Do you hear the Parshendi song as you write it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

To an extent, yes, but I'm not as musically inclined as some, and so if we ever do it, I'd probably have somebody else come up with something more... It's more of a cadence though.

## [Entry #7](./t-1076/7)

#### Question

Are you going to expand on the cosmere in its own book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, the thing that started it all, Dragonsteel, is going to be about the cosmere a lot more, and the third Mistborn trilogy will be also. I want to make sure that it never comes to the forefront until I am warning people, "Now, you need to know this stuff."

## [Entry #8](./t-1076/8)

#### Question

Will you ever have characters use the different systems of magic openly in front of each other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll warn you this, the third Mistborn trilogy is a space opera, which will involve travel between planets.

## [Entry #9](./t-1076/9)

#### Question

What was Kaladin's original decision that you changed?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kaladin won the Plate and Blade in chapter one and kept it.

## [Entry #10](./t-1076/10)

#### Question

How did you decide that you were going to tackle racism, classism, gender, all those things in
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One of the things I like about Fantasy is the ability to tackle things like this in a way that removes the baggage from our current society which is why you see me doing things like the gender relations centered around whether the hand is sleeved or not. I want to do something that is one step removed so that it is pertinent... The Parshendi-Human thing is going to be a big deal for the series so I wanted to introduce it early on in the books.

## [Entry #11](./t-1076/11)

#### Question

Would aluminum give an atium shadow? Like if someone threw an aluminum spear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The aluminum would not give an atium shadow. Good question.

## [Entry #12](./t-1076/12)

#### Question

When you were planning Zahel being Vasher, how long did you do that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher was in the 2002 version of
*The Way of Kings*
by name. I only changed him to the new name after I finished this entire draft. Because I was like, oh he'd probably go under a pseudonym. So he's been in Roshar 12 years our time.

## [Entry #13](./t-1076/13)

#### Question

The Ars Arcanum, is there an in-cosmere author of that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it is in cosmere

#### Question

Because it seems like it'd be written by someone like Hoid.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not him. I don't know if I've released who it is; but it's probably not who people are thinking but it is in-world.

## [Entry #14](./t-1076/14)

#### Question

So what was the Moment?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was actually right near the climax. It was the phrase 'These words are accepted.'... Oh I thought you were talking about the Moment of Inspiration. Oh the moment you're asking about is the moment where Kaladin, in the original writing, he took the Blade and plate instead of turning it down.

## [Entry #15](./t-1076/15)

#### Question

Why didn't Shallan summon her Shardblade on the ship when they were attacked?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Shardblade has a lot of... I mean if you look at it she thought about it. She has this psychological thing where she ignores the past, and it's so painful to her, the things that happened.

## [Entry #16](./t-1076/16)

#### Question

Why did you gloss over [audio obscured]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because Jasnah, that was not going to happen in this book. In the initial plot it didn't happen, and Shallan was unable to, in the initial scenes I wrote, come into her own and so I had to make major revisions to the plot for this outline, the biggest thing I did was that.

## [Entry #17](./t-1076/17)

#### Question

What's your favorite original Shardholder?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know... The tricky thing is that I'm going to have to write them as their personalities because right now they are just concepts. I'm very fond of Bavadin but I can't say.

## [Entry #18](./t-1076/18)

#### Question

Is Bavadin the only shard on Taldain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is the only shard on the planet.

#### Question

Is he the sun?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO

## [Entry #19](./t-1076/19)

#### Question

Would a Hemalurgic spike take surges?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hemalurgy can interact with every one of the magics. I designed it specifically in writing Mistborn for future use. Because some of the magics are so limited by their planet I wanted one that transcended all of them and Hemalurgy is very important to the entire cosmere Its invention is a thing of great power and great danger to the entire cosmere.

## [Entry #20](./t-1076/20)

#### Question

Have people not from/on Scadrial used Hemalurgy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #21](./t-1076/21)

#### Question

What was the pouch on the Radiant in Dalinar's vision in
*Words of Radiance*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. I'm not saying its important, but you have to get a RAFO.

## [Entry #22](./t-1076/22)

#### Question

Were there spren bonds before Aharietiam?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not going to answer that one either but we will delve much more into this. The spren were around back then but they're not nearly what they are now they've changed over the course of the book obviously. I think the cosmere theorists have figured it out. They are much more prevalent following Honor and what happened to him, but there were some spren on the planet before even that happened.

## [Entry #23](./t-1076/23)

#### Question

Are there other shards in the Taldain solar system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Now that's a clever question. There is only one for that solar system. There are other places with only one. It's not uncommon. We've gone to places with more than one because that is where the conflict is cosmere-centric.

## [Entry #24](./t-1076/24)

#### Question

What were Jasnah's "last thoughts"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Her "last thoughts" were of escaping.

## [Entry #25](./t-1076/25)

#### Question

Is Jasnah's book going to be one of the backstories?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is. She's on the back five.

## [Entry #26](./t-1076/26)

#### Question

So that bit at the end [of
*Words of Radiance*
with Szeth...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's setting up for book 3, which is going to be crazy.

## [Entry #27](./t-1076/27)

#### Question

Do all the humans have innate Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that they all do. I don't think that you've seen anyone without innate Investiture yet. [Drabs] do not have innate Investiture. And on Scadrial they have the pieces of Ruin and Preservation in them. And they do have it on Roshar.

#### Question

Which Shard is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll have to RAFO

## [Entry #28](./t-1076/28)

#### Question

In
*The Way of Kings*
you do this one thing from the PoV of Gaz, where you turn him from random bad guy to interesting character. You said that if we read carefully we could figure out what happened to him but I never could?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So he had his debts. He was owing people debts and they came due and he deserted.

## [Entry #29](./t-1076/29)

#### Question

What's the deal with safehands?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll find out eventually. There is something it originated in. Inspired by bottoms of feet being offensive in Korea.

## [Entry #30](./t-1076/30)

#### Question

Why do they ride horses instead of fast insects of some sort?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is an excellent question that I am not going to answer.

## [Entry #31](./t-1076/31)

#### Question

At the very end of
*Words of Radiance*
, Dalinar touches a Shardblade and it screams at him. Should that particular Blade have been safe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No it should not have. It's a clue that something has happened. There are other clues that something is wrong with what the story you've been told is.

#### Question

Because Option 2 is that it's unsafe to touch an honorblade, but there's no evidence of that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is no evidence of that. There's much stronger evidence that something else is going on.

#### Question

Did Hoid switch out the blades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid did not switch out the blades, but good question.

## [Entry #32](./t-1076/32)

#### Question

Does
*The Silence Divine*
take place in the cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does, it takes place on a planet called Threnody. There is no shard on that planet however. The magic is more something you interact with, not something you perform because there isn't a shard there.

#### Footnote

Brandon makes a mistake here, confusing the stories of "
*The Silence Divine*
" and "
*Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell*
".
*The Silence Divine*
takes place on Ashyn, whereas Threnody is the setting for
*Shadows for Silence*

## [Entry #33](./t-1076/33)

#### Question

If Kelsier's Cognitive Shadow or a Seon went to the Forests of Hell, would they be shades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that is the same thing. The people on that planet; their Investiture; the lack of shard means that their cognitive shadows react differently. The ghost of Leras is the same thing too.

## [Entry #34](./t-1076/34)

#### Question

If Nightblood were on Roshar would he be a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, they are exactly the same thing. He is a Shardblade that is twisted and is a lot more powerful than normal.

## [Entry #35](./t-1076/35)

#### [The Question/Anaroth85 (paraphrased question)](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/5853-san-francisco-wor-signing/page-3#entry106161)

During the Final Empire Era, had anyone on Scadrial, particularly Sazed, Tindwyl, or Elend, read The Way of Kings?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/5853-san-francisco-wor-signing/page-3#entry106161)

The Way of Kings as a novel is known off-world, but not on any of the planets you mentioned. At least not currently.
