## [Entry #1](./t-494/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've got the Photoshop contest winners below, but first the weekly updates. In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations I discuss
[TenSoon's visit to Urteau](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/331/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fifty-Nine)
and
[Vin attacking without using Allomancy](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/332/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Sixty)
.

This past weekend was BYU's science fiction/fantasy symposium, Life, the Universe & Everything. This was my first convention as Guest of Honor (as well as my first con after the release of
*The Gathering Storm*
), and there was a huge crowd—including our largest crowd ever for an episode of Writing Excuses, several of which we recorded at the con. Up first—airing as this week's episode—James Dashner joined Dan, Howard, and me to discuss pacing.

. I also did a couple of interviews during the convention; one with Provo's Daily Herald resulted in a video that they've put up
[on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYPvXkBUz8o)
.

My assistant also sent out a newsletter to everyone on my mailing list for the first time in almost four years. I've posted a copy
[here](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/60/Brandon-Sanderson-Newsletter-for-February-2010)
. Baby pictures included! The newsletter is mostly for the benefit of people who don't come to my site very often, but if you tell me what city you're in, I also send out reminders when I'm signing nearby. Consider putting your name on the list; anyone who
[sends me an email](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/contact)
gets added.

And now to the Photoshop contest. I recruited Maria from Team Jordan, Jason and Jenn from Dragonmount, and my assistant Peter to help judge, and we eventually settled on winners for first, second, and third place. I also picked two Judge's Choice winners from other entries I found especially deserving.

FIRST PLACE

This picture of Tam holding a baby iPad Photoshopped by John S. fits in such a creepy way. As the big winner, John picked a copy of the hardcover
*Able One*
by Ben Bova for me to buy from Mysterious Galaxy and have shipped to him. He also gets a signed copy of Mistborn. Congratulations, John!

SECOND PLACE

I can't believe all the things people did with my head in this contest! Laird Duncan wins a copy of
*Imager*
by L. E. Modesitt, plus a signed copy of Mistborn.

THIRD PLACE

This one had the judges cracking up. Gavin Doyle wins a copy of
*The Revolution Business*
by Charlie Stross (and a signed copy of Mistborn).

JUDGE'S CHOICE

These entries by Michael Willett (left) and Valeryan (right) get special Judge's Choice awards. Michael's Photoshopping is just so good here, and the whole concept fits so well. And I couldn't stop laughing when I saw Valeryan's entry the first time—I imagined Lews Therin rocking out to Journey's greatest hits, unable to keep the tears in. (Valeryan, you haven't responded to my assistant yet, so I don't know whether you want me to send you a copy of the Mistborn Table of Allomantic Metals or the Mistborn paperback. Please check your email!) Both of you have my highest appreciation for your skill and excecution.

The full slate of entries is up in a
[Picasa album](https://picasaweb.google.com/109650037631101102272/WheelOfTimeEbookReaderPhotoshopContest)
for your perusal. There were so many great entries; you guys are really creative. Have fun looking at all the entries, and remember to support your local independent bookseller!
