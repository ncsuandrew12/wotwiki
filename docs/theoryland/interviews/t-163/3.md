#### Robert Jordan

I'm still not going to tell you. [laughter] Someone has sent me a logical chain reaction working out correctly who killed Asmodean using only the evidence that is in the books. [The next part is inaudible on my recording, but I remember him making reference to two things. One, he did not tell the person who submitted the explanation that they were correct; and two, he just likes watching us squirm.]
