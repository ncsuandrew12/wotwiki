# [Interview #163: COT Signing Report - JD Urbanski, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=163#8)

#### JD Urbanski

During our conversation Jordan stopped in mid signing to ponder my questions and when he answered he looked me straight in the eye. After the second question he seemed to be waiting for another question, and while I did have more ready, I figured I had held his line up long enough and simply thanked him for his comments. So, overall I must say that Jordan really impressed me with his presence, but I was disappointed that we didn't have a general Q&A session that the other tour reporters have mentioned. It was worth waiting to meet him and if you can make it to a signing I suggest you do so.
