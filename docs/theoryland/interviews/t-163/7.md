# [Interview #163: COT Signing Report - JD Urbanski, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=163#7)

#### JD Urbanski

My second question was did he believe that genre books deserved to win the major literary prizes such as the Pulitzer or the Booker.

#### Robert Jordan

Before I had finished Jordan began, "Of course, of course. But you'll notice that some books that are fantasy are not called fantasy. Doris Lessing writes fantasy. A.S. Byatt writes fantasy. [inaudible name] is fantasy, writes fantasy. The magical realists write fantasy. If you write and deny that you write fantasy then you're acceptable for a major award and/or the accolades of the critics. If you say that you write fantasy, then you've marked yourself as living in the ghetto. So, I write fantasy and I wear my ghetto tattoos proudly."
