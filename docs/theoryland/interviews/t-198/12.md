# [Interview #198, Entry #12]: DragonCon Signing Reports - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=198#12)

#### Matt Hatch

You have been killing my theories left and right since I got here.

#### Robert Jordan

I have always thought that the small whimper of a theory as it dies is a beautiful sound.

(General laughter all around.)

#### Matt Hatch

Ouch. Okay, now that you have killed my black cord theory, are the oaths and covenants Forsaken make with the Dark One necessary for the Dark One to transmigrate a soul?

#### Robert Jordan

They are not necessary, but he is not likely to do it for anyone who hasn't done, who hasn't sworn to him.

#### Matt Hatch

He doesn't have access to all souls to be able to grab any soul?

#### Robert Jordan

No, no, no. Because of the Bore and the fact that the bore is best perceived, the Bore doesn't really exist in Shayol Ghul, the Bore exists everywhere, it's simply in Shayol Ghul where it can be perceived most easily. By the same token he has greater access to people at Shayol Ghul than he does elsewhere, or did, and uh, that's, when you know, Rahvin died, Rahvin is balefired out of time, slain out of time, cannot be reached, gone. Be'lal, (names someone else).

#### Matt Hatch

Well, then is there something unique about the Forsaken other than the fact that they are his favorites that he would transmigrate them, or be able to?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, he would have been a lot less likely to in an earlier time when they were a lot of powerful knowledgeable channelers who were in his service. Essentially half the people in the world who could channel were on his side, during the War of the Shadow. Now he has very few, he's got the Black Ajah, and a few wilders, and some stuff I ain't going in to, but uh he doesn't have a lot, but he can't afford to waste assets.

#### Matt Hatch

Okay.
