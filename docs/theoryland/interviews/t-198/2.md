#### Isabel

Since you said Galad fancied Nynaeve first. But in
*The Great Hunt*
I thought he fancied Egwene first because he asked Egwene for a walk in the garden.

#### Robert Jordan

Galad just thought Egwene was pretty and that it would be nice to walk with her. (Harriet added that it doesn't always have to be love at first sight.)

#### Isabel

I wanted to ask RJ some more about the Galad fancied Nynaeve thing. I searched up the quotes in book two that pointed to Egwene. (Didn't have three with me and no good access to internet or my notes.) With this answer I really think there are much more relations and mistaken thought by characters than we thought. Gawyn thought Galad fancied Egwene, remember...And not all quotes are what they seem to be. I think 90 percent of the people or even more just assumed the Elayne quote was a mistake. I certainly did!!!
