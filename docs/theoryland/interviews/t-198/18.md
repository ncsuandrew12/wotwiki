# [Interview #198: DragonCon Signing Reports - Matt Hatch, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=198#18)

#### [IsabelÂ (later)](http://theoryland.yuku.com/topic/9911/hehe-a-not-so-very-interesting-question-asked#.UB3OG0SXPA8)

I just remembered one question I asked RJ. And I thought I didn't include it. I asked if Calian and Shivan are born at the end of every Age.

#### Robert Jordan

As far as I remember the answer was yes. ;)

#### Isabel

I think I also asked if they are already born, but that must have been a RAFO. :)

Not very interesting, but perhaps another Theorylander was with me at that time. ;) (I thought I didn't include it [in an earlier report], but I am not 100 percent sure. :p )
