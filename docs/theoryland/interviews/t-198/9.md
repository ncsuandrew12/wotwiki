# [Interview #198: DragonCon Signing Reports - Matt Hatch, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=198#9)

#### Ted Herman

Is Shaidar Haran an avatar to the world beyond the Bore?

#### Robert Jordan

I am not certain you can really call him an avatar because I generally think of an avatar as having exactly the same powers as, and it is not, Shaidar Haran does not have nearly as much power as the Dark One. It's as though the Dark One is able to project a shadowy form of himself into this creature. It is the Dark One in shadowy form.

#### Ted Herman

Is it twenty-four seven, or just part time?

#### Robert Jordan

Twenty-four seven.

#### Ted Herman

Ohh.

#### Harriet

Shaidar Haran has another life in the suburbs.

#### Ted Herman

Yeah, he has two and half little fades running around.

#### Harriet

He has to go home for the weekend to cut the grass. I don't think so.
