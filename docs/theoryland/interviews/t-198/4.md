#### Isabel

Nynaeve was born with the spark, right?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Isabel

Because yesterday there was a question about Learners...somebody who is not born with the spark, but is born with the ability to learn, could they begin channeling unconsciously?

#### Robert Jordan

No, they could not, they would have to make a conscious effort. They could make a conscious effort without a teacher and maybe succeed, but without a teacher they've got a very small chance of actually doing it.
