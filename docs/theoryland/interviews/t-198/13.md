# [Interview #198: DragonCon Signing Reports - Matt Hatch, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=198#13)

#### Isabel

Have you started writing the next book already?

#### Robert Jordan

In a sort of desultory way, working, the week after I handed in the final manuscript, and sent it off to New York, I started working half day here, three quarter day there, a half day again.

#### Matt Hatch

Well, I am hoping for that fifteen hundred page book.

#### Robert Jordan

It may be—I am not saying it will be that big—and I will fight them doing a George R.R Martin on me.

#### Matt Hatch

Yeah, please do.
