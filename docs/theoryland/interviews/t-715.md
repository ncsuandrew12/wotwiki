#### [SwiftxJustice (Mon Jan 16)](http://twitter.com/SwiftxJustice/status/158757364760190977)

Quick question to help me settle a debate. Could allomancy affect a shard plate/blade?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Mon Jan 16)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159044890074939392)

No. Investiture interferes with most magics.

Wait, are Mistborn and Stormlight Archive somehow connected?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Thu Jan 19)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159835105878224897)

Multiple people from Mistborn appeared in
*The Way of Kings*
.

"Multiple people" includes Hoid.

#### [MIKEYSIMMONS2 (Wed Jan 18)](http://twitter.com/MIKEYSIMMONS2/status/159518892602048512)

What advice would you give to writers for expanding description and vocabulary

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Thu Jan 19)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159836036569104384)

For the first, learn to be brief and concrete. We have done writing excuses on the topic.

For the second, look for the best (most precise) word, not some random term from the thesaurus. (Sp?)

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=715#4)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Thu Jan 19)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159885651473469440)

Right now, taking a (short) break from the WoT rewrite to spend an evening working on the Mistborn video game script.

#### [Allison Hagen](http://twitter.com/AllisonHagen/status/159886846850105344)

XBox? PC?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159888847088521216)

Both.

#### [QRevolution](http://twitter.com/qrevolution/status/159888220526616576)

I don't suppose you can tell us who's developing it yet, can you?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159889167378165760)

Afraid I'm not allowed to say yet.

#### [Abel Silva](http://twitter.com/abelsilva/status/159889667683127296)

Is Epic games developing? Is this how they got you to write the Infinity Blade novella?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159890360691208192)

I hope to do some projects with Epic in the future, but they are not doing this one.

Part of why I took that project, however, was to get more experience with video game storytelling and plotting.

#### [Electrik Viking](http://twitter.com/electrikviking/status/160109109692207104)

Really looking forward to Mistborn game will it be xbox, do you get to be Kel?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160186601924853761)

It's set hundreds of years before the first book.

#### [Minimana93](http://twitter.com/Mimimana93/status/160107750733529089)

hello I've read
*Elantris*
and
*Mistborn*
(best books ever!) May I ask when the video game is planned to be released? Thanks

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160186793701015553)

Summer/Fall 2013, I think.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=715#5)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Web Feb 01)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164810394303602689)

Subterranean Press has announced preorder availability of my new novella "Legion," coming sometime in the summer/fall.

#### [WHURSMABELLY](http://twitter.com/whursmabelly/status/165384222574522368)

Did you know there's a Marvel Comics character called Legion who has abilities very similair to those found in your novella?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/165392919543554049)

Someone mentioned it to me yesterday. I'm afraid, though, it's impossible not to do things that Marve/DC haven't covered.

Magneto vs Allomancy, for example, or about a billion gravity manipulation superheroes vs Szeth.

When I write something, I can't ask "Has anyone done this before?" because the answer will ALWAYS be yes.

:) That said, it's amusing (but perhaps not surprising) that we both used the same idea with the name.

#### [WHURSMABELLY](http://twitter.com/whursmabelly/status/165398826079883264)

Have you ever felt the need to change anything in your writing that was TOO close to something already out there?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/165456650789072899)

Yes, I have—but only in the pre-publication stage. If I'd known about the Marvel character, for example

I probably would have used another name. Still, knowing now means I can change it if I do a full novel.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Fri Feb 03)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/165315207185444864)

About to do my first event in Taiwan. I will be knighting people. They have a sword for me and everything.

So . . . turns out I'm kind of a superstar here. That event was crazy big. Thank you for making me feel loved, Taiwan.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=715#7)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Wed Feb 08)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167313062221709314)

Oh, bureaucracy, you are my bane. It always takes me like five minutes to figure out how to spell that word . . .

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=715#8)

#### [zas678 (Mon Feb 20)](https://twitter.com/#!/zas678/status/171708690532012032/embed)

We have conflicting reports on chronology. Is
[this](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#48)
right, or is
[this](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=708#7)
right?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Mon Feb 20)](https://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/171711832069910528/embed)

The second. I revised my placement of KINGS relative to HERO after realizing a behind-the-scenes conflict.

ALLOY had to happen after KINGS for Cosmere reasons. I had two timelines arguing, and in plotting Stormlight 2, I fixed this.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=715#9)

#### [zas678 (Mar 5 2012)](https://twitter.com/#!/zas678/status/176763965328732160)

Hey @PeterAhlstrom could you tell us what Aona's Shard was? Brandon
said he'd look it up
and get back to us, but.... [he never got back to us.]

#### [Peter Ahlstrom (Mar 5 2012)](https://twitter.com/#!/PeterAhlstrom/status/176764934020022273)

I thought sure that was answered already. But anyway, the answer is yes [Aona is Devotion].
