## Entry #1

#### Ha T. Nguyen

Well, I saw RJ in Seattle on Sunday and he was nice and answered my questions. Also, he personalized books if you went twice around the line. Which I did.

## Entry #2

#### Ha T. Nguyen

I asked who killed Asmodean, the Hot New Choice (HNC) or Graendal?

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that one day he might answer this question, but, if people would just analyze where everyone was at the time, it could be figured out.

#### Ha T. Nguyen

So, I'm thinking, Graendal, since she is the only one who had a timeline that could be figured out. Currently, that is. Unless, someone comes up with one for the HNC.

## Entry #3

#### Ha T. Nguyen

He is currently writing the next book so, maybe, maybe, next year?

Unfortunately, I couldn't think of any more questions.

Ha
