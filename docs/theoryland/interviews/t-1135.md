## [Entry #1](./t-1135/1)

#### KChan

Are all magics on Sel their own individual systems, or are they different manifestations of the same system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are different manifestations of the same system.

## [Entry #2](./t-1135/2)

#### KChan

Are all magics on Sel influenced by both Devotion and Dominion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #3](./t-1135/3)

#### Shardlet

In hemalurgy, does the person doing the spiking need to have Scadrian investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Question

So, anyone with the knowledge could spike someone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Tags

hemalurgy

## [Entry #4](./t-1135/4)

#### Shardlet

You said previously that a slider's bubble is anchored to its position on Scadrial rather than on the slider's position or on the train (if the burner was on a train). If the slider was on a rock in space, would the bubble be anchored to a position relative to Scadrial, the rock or something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #5](./t-1135/5)

#### Shardlet

A slider and a pulser are standing near each other and each put up a bubble. Neither is standing close enough to the other to be within the other's bubble, but they are near enough that their bubbles would overlap what effect would you have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The bubbles would overlap and it would be like a Venn diagram (i.e., outside both bubbles-normal time, in sliders bubble-fast time, in pulser's bubble-slow time, in the overlap-normal time).

## [Entry #6](./t-1135/6)

#### Shardlet

If a time bubble is raised in a vacuum, is the diameter larger than a bubble raised in atmosphere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, atmosphere has no effect on bubble diameter.

## [Entry #7](./t-1135/7)

#### Shardlet

If a Scadrian allomancer had a baby with a Nalthian (and the baby was born on Nalthis), could the baby have an original Breath and also be a Natural allomancer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It could happen, the baby would have a bit of Preservation and a bit of Endowment.
