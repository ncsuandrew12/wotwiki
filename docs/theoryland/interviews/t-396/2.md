# [Interview #396: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: MB3 Proofreads Due..., Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=396#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

As for
*A Memory of Light*
, I've been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes revisions lately. I didn't put up a progress bar for them, since they're scattered revisions here and there, and it's harder to judge when they'll be finished. It seems odd to put up a progress bar for something I know will only take one day—which some of the revisions do—but I don't know exactly how long they will take all together, or even how many there will be. I do occasionally find time to write some new material, and so I'll keep updating the main progress bar.
