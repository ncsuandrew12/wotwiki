#### Brandon Sanderson

Hey, it's time for me to send in corrections for the mass market version of Mistborn Three. I just wanted to throw out to the readers a question: Did any of you spot any big problems that were continuity/proofreading errors? Did I forget and use silver instead of tin anywhere? Use the wrong name for a character? That sort of thing. If you spotted a big proofreading error like this, feel free to drop me an email or post on my Livejournal to give me a heads up.
