## Entry #1

#### Robert Jordan

Dear Carolyn:

Thanks for your letter of May 21, and for the copies of
*The Chronicles*
, which I enjoyed very much. Please keep them coming. Your take on the prophecies is interesting. Hmmmm.

Oh my dear, I do hope there will not be ten books all told. I'm planning for eight, at present, and hope very strongly that I can wrap it all up in that length. Enjoy your vacation!

Best Regards,

Robert Jordan
