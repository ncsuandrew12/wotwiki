# [Interview #369: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Wheel of Time Movie Deal, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=369#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

People have already started emailing me about this.

My response is . . . huzzah! Congratulations Harriet! I know that things have been stalled for a long time on this front, and while she mentioned to me that something like this might be coming, I didn't think it would be so soon.

I'm afraid I'm not the one to ask about specifics, however. Even if I knew them, I wouldn't be comfortable sharing them. But I'm sure more will be coming in the future. All I will say is to remember that things like this tend to move very slowly. I hope that won't be the case here, but chances are good that it will be many years before we actually get to see the movie.

Now, back to work on Book Twelve. . . .
