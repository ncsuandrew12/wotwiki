# [Interview #1060: Graeme + Brandon Sanderson + Three Questions = ?, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1060#3)

#### Graeme Flory

2. Shard plate and shard blades can win wars, what would you have made out of shard to win the battles in your day?

#### Brandon Sanderson

These are very inventive questions. What would I want made out of this stuff? Someone once suggested a Shardpen. But no, a Shardpen isn't going to work any better than a non-Shardpen. I would say a Shardphone. If I could get a phone that never broke and everything always worked perfectly on itâ€”or a Shardlaptop, that would be awesome.
