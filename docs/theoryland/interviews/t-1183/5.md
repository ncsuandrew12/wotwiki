# [Interview #1183, Entry #5]: Deseret News Q&A: Brandon Sanderson on the importance of fiction and how writing influences his LDS faith](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1183#5)

#### Justin Carmony

That leads into my next question: why did you pick Dalinar to tell his backstory in this particular book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's interesting because originally I was going to do Dalinar in book five. That was the original outline. But I found that (was) the story I was telling in this book.

… What I wanted to have happen in these books is the character's backstory offers insight, parallel or some sort of interweaving with the main plot that the characters are going through in the present in order to change your perspective both on the past and on the present by what you read in the character's backstory. That's the goal. … I found that the more I worked on this book the more Dalinar's paralleled, or at sometimes contrasted nicely to the story that was going on right now. So I switched, it was going to be Szeth's and I switched to Dalinar and I am really pleased with how that went. The back and forth between the person Dalinar is becoming in this book, and the person he used to be, the journey he began when he was younger, and is only now meeting his fulfillment in his middle age, that story paralleled so nicely.
