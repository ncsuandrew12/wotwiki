First off, congratulations on having the most pre-ordered audiobook in
[Audible.com](https://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Oathbringer-Audiobook/B0718Z5K4C/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srImg?qid=1510338045&sr=1-1)
's history.

Thank you, that was very cool. â€¦ Some people might know there really is an audiobook renaissance going on. They've been gaining ground the last decade, but really recently they've been just exploding. A lot of people are finding that they love listening to audiobooks, and what they particularly love listening to audiobooks for are books that are otherwise bulky and hard to carry around. They are not only a really good value on Audible, or your audiobook website of choice, but also since they are so big and heavy they are just much more portable in audiobook form. So we tend to do really well in audio, but I still didn't expect to be the No. 1 most pre-ordered book of all-time on Audible.
