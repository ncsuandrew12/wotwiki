# [Interview #1183: Deseret News Q&A: Brandon Sanderson on the importance of fiction and how writing influences his LDS faith, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1183#11)

#### Felix Bauhardt

Will there be more spin-off books in the world of Roshar? (like
*Edgedancer*
for example, as it's not a main series entry)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I've got an outline for one right now. I don't know if I'll write it sooner or later, but there is a really good chance it'll get written between the next two Stormlight books.
