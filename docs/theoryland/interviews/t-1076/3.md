# [Interview #1076: WoR Signing Report - Bartbug, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1076#3)

#### Question

What powers does [Hoid] have, what magics is he using?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you watch in these books, he has used on screen so far three of the different magics?

#### Question

Have we seen those three, do we know what those three are?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know at least two of them. More obvious clues are in [
*Words of Radiance*
]. Watch where he and Kaladin have some interactions. Watch carefully, you will see something in what he mentions. You've seen him and Shallan, that scene in one of her flashbacks, in that scene he uses one if you watch.
