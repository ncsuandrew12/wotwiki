#### Question

Why did you gloss over [audio obscured]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because Jasnah, that was not going to happen in this book. In the initial plot it didn't happen, and Shallan was unable to, in the initial scenes I wrote, come into her own and so I had to make major revisions to the plot for this outline, the biggest thing I did was that.
