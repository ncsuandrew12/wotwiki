#### Question

If Kelsier's Cognitive Shadow or a Seon went to the Forests of Hell, would they be shades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that is the same thing. The people on that planet; their Investiture; the lack of shard means that their cognitive shadows react differently. The ghost of Leras is the same thing too.
