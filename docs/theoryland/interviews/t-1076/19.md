#### Question

Would a Hemalurgic spike take surges?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hemalurgy can interact with every one of the magics. I designed it specifically in writing Mistborn for future use. Because some of the magics are so limited by their planet I wanted one that transcended all of them and Hemalurgy is very important to the entire cosmere Its invention is a thing of great power and great danger to the entire cosmere.
