#### Question

Do all the humans have innate Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that they all do. I don't think that you've seen anyone without innate Investiture yet. [Drabs] do not have innate Investiture. And on Scadrial they have the pieces of Ruin and Preservation in them. And they do have it on Roshar.

#### Question

Which Shard is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll have to RAFO
