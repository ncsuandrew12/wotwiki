# [Interview #1076: WoR Signing Report - Bartbug, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1076#12)

#### Question

When you were planning Zahel being Vasher, how long did you do that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher was in the 2002 version of
*The Way of Kings*
by name. I only changed him to the new name after I finished this entire draft. Because I was like, oh he'd probably go under a pseudonym. So he's been in Roshar 12 years our time.
