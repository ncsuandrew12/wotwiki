#### Question

At the very end of
*Words of Radiance*
, Dalinar touches a Shardblade and it screams at him. Should that particular Blade have been safe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No it should not have. It's a clue that something has happened. There are other clues that something is wrong with what the story you've been told is.

#### Question

Because Option 2 is that it's unsafe to touch an honorblade, but there's no evidence of that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is no evidence of that. There's much stronger evidence that something else is going on.

#### Question

Did Hoid switch out the blades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid did not switch out the blades, but good question.
