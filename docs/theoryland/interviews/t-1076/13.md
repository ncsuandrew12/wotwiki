#### Question

The Ars Arcanum, is there an in-cosmere author of that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it is in cosmere

#### Question

Because it seems like it'd be written by someone like Hoid.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not him. I don't know if I've released who it is; but it's probably not who people are thinking but it is in-world.
