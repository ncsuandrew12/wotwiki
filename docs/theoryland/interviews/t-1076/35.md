#### [The Question/Anaroth85 (paraphrased question)](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/5853-san-francisco-wor-signing/page-3#entry106161)

During the Final Empire Era, had anyone on Scadrial, particularly Sazed, Tindwyl, or Elend, read The Way of Kings?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/5853-san-francisco-wor-signing/page-3#entry106161)

The Way of Kings as a novel is known off-world, but not on any of the planets you mentioned. At least not currently.
