# [Interview #1076: WoR Signing Report - Bartbug, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1076#7)

#### Question

Are you going to expand on the cosmere in its own book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, the thing that started it all, Dragonsteel, is going to be about the cosmere a lot more, and the third Mistborn trilogy will be also. I want to make sure that it never comes to the forefront until I am warning people, "Now, you need to know this stuff."
