#### Question

How did you decide that you were going to tackle racism, classism, gender, all those things in
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One of the things I like about Fantasy is the ability to tackle things like this in a way that removes the baggage from our current society which is why you see me doing things like the gender relations centered around whether the hand is sleeved or not. I want to do something that is one step removed so that it is pertinent... The Parshendi-Human thing is going to be a big deal for the series so I wanted to introduce it early on in the books.
