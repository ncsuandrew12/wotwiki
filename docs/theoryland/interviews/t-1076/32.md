# [Interview #1076: WoR Signing Report - Bartbug, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1076#32)

#### Question

Does
*The Silence Divine*
take place in the cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does, it takes place on a planet called Threnody. There is no shard on that planet however. The magic is more something you interact with, not something you perform because there isn't a shard there.

#### Footnote

Brandon makes a mistake here, confusing the stories of "
*The Silence Divine*
" and "
*Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell*
".
*The Silence Divine*
takes place on Ashyn, whereas Threnody is the setting for
*Shadows for Silence*
