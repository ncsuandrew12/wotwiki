## Entry #1

#### Nicrosil

Just got back, asked a few questions. Please note that these are super paraphrased, but I did see someone's IPhone on the table, so we hopefully have a transcript!

#### Question

Have we seen another Lightweaver?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The power? Yes. The Order? No.

## Entry #2

#### Nicrosil

Would any of the Orders be okay with one being an assassin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Nicrosil

Please note that a family member decided to drop in at this point, so I may have heard wrong. Woops.

## Entry #4

#### Nicrosil

Can you Compound to the point where you become a Savant?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, being a Savant is when you burn so much it alters your spirit, Compounding is similar but different.

#### Nicrosil

He might have heard the question wrong here, I don't know. I should have asked it differently. But, there goes my theory :P

## Entry #6

#### Nicrosil

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*Laughs\* Everyone loves Stick. But no, there aren't any plans to have more Stick.

So that was cool! It's a real shame though that my copy of WoK is currently on loan <\_< .
