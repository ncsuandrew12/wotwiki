***Towers of Midnight*
: What did I learn?**
  

Set Your Sights High

I've never been one to dodge a challenge. However, after failing to do
*The Way of Kings*
right in 2002, I was timid about tackling complex narratives across many, many viewpoints.
*Towers of Midnight*
marked the largest-scale book I'd ever attempted, with the most complexity of viewpoints, the greatest number of distinct and different scenes to balance, and the most ambitious forms of storytelling. Aviendha's trip through the glass pillars was the most audacious thing I believe I pitched at Team Jordan, and was one of the things about which they were the most skeptical. Perrin's balance between action and inaction risked having him descend into passiveness.

I worked on the new version of
*The Way of Kings*
during this time, in 2009–10, when I was also working on
*Towers of Midnight*
. I doubt I will ever be more busy than I was in those two years, tackling two of the biggest books of my career at the same time. However, during this time I entered a place in my writing where something clicked, dealing with the next stage of my writing career. I'd always wanted to master the complex epic—my favorite stories of all time fit this mold. Before this, however, I'd done very few sequels—and
*Towers of Midnight*
was the most complicated sequel I'm ever likely to do.

I learned a great deal about myself during this period, and the results are on the pages of these two books,
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*The Way of Kings*
.
