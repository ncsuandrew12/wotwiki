# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#6)

#### Richard Fife

So, after this I go and attend the Sanderson workshop on writing, where he had to fit into two one-hour sessions the fourteen week class he teaches at BYU. He did a good job of the summary, though, and gave some insight into the writing of
*A Memory of Light*
as well. I'll get into that a bit later.

I run up and snag a fiber-one bar for lunch, then head back down at one o'clock and watch the Belly-dancing demo/class. Mmm, belly-dancers. It gives a really good idea of the Tiganzaâ€”poor Perrin.
