# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#12)

#### Richard Fife

Day Three: Sunday

I wake up at Seven. Again, don't ask why. I get my things packed up and out to my car, then go and have breakfast with Alan and his wife. Much fun conversation and discussion. Oh, and I will stop being mean, no I did not learn any secrets that I cannot tell you during all my hobnobbing with Team Jordan. They are very tight-lipped, and even delighted in taunting us.
