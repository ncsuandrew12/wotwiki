# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#8)

#### Richard Fife

So, next panel was Team Jordan, which I also gophered. Alan and Maria, RJ's assistants, Wilson, Harriet, Brandon, and Tom all offered us some good logic and reasoning behind the split, what to expect in the writing, and told us that while they would not mind seeing the prologue e-pub'd over at Simon & Schuster, the agent is currently in England, and any exact details will have to wait. The reasons for the split are much as one might expect: the whole of
*A Memory of Light*
is starting to look more like it might be 900k words, so three 300k books just made more sense.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Also, Harriet promised us (to many applause) that we will not get just one very satisfying climax in
*The Gathering Storm*
, but TWO! The whole
*A Memory of Light*
has 6 total, and they have organized the material and action to give us two in each book. To this effect, though, do not expect to see absolutely everyone. They had to save some stuff for book 2 and 3, so if the character/plot you are wanting the most isn't in book 12, it likely will be in book 13. More on exactly why later.
