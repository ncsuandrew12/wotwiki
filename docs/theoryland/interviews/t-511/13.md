#### Richard Fife

So yeah, after breakfast with Alan, I go to the
*gai'shain*
/volunteer appreciation breakfast-thingie. I got a nice
[hookmark](http://www.hookmarks.com/)
, with the Wheel of Time symbol on it. After the first wave of swag was given out, Tiff the
*Gai'shain*
Coordinator used a random number generator to give out stuff randomly, including some nice shawls. Well, she offered up a shawl, hit the button, and my name came up. She said, "um, you can take a con shirt instead," to which I puffed up my chest and said, "I'll take the shawl." I now own a wonderful yellow shawl, and I did wear it for the rest of the con. Alas, (or fortunately), I do not think anyone got a picture of me in it.
