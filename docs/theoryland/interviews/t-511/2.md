#### Richard Fife

Day 1: Friday

I arrived around noon, picked up my badge, but alas not a room key because my room wasn't ready yet. So, I went over to the restaurant and drank a soda while writing a bit on my laptop. I then happened to glance over and see Tom Doherty and Harriet Jordan themselves, sitting at a table and working on something. I respectfully kept my distance, but it was a wonderful indicator of things to come.
