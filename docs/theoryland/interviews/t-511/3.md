# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#3)

#### Richard Fife

At one o'clock, we had the opening ceremony. Jason from
[Dragonmount](http://dragonmount.com)
created a funny, 40 page stage-skit that "recapped" all 11 books and introduced the Con. The actors were the Con guests, community leaders and some people from Tor, and... Yours Truly. There was a joke of Matt from
[Theoryland](http://theoryland.com)
refusing to play Mat, so they needed a volunteer, and it got to be me. And I was truly a volunteerâ€”my script cued me as "Volunteer Mat", and I had not seen it until Jason handed it to me. Getting to be on stage with everyone else was the next great indicator of the weekend. I know there is at least one recording of the ceremony, and I hope to find it soon just so that I can see what it was like from somewhere besides stage left. (and so anyone who missed the live feed or wasn't there can see it too).
