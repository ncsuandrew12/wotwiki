# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#15)

#### Richard Fife

So, after Brandon's Panel, where he explained this, I made my goodbyes and made the drive home. Alas, it was a seven hour drive, so I missed the only other panel I was interested in with Red Eagle, where they were talking about—ready for it again?—a Wheel of Time live-action movie. I did chat with the producer some the night before, and I will tell you this: the man is a mega-fan. I have strong hopes for this.
