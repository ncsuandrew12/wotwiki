# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#16)

#### Richard Fife

Coda: Monday

Iâ€™m back in "The Real World" right now, putting off doing work while typing this up. I admit to feeling detached and listless, and my co-workers are poking jokes at my constant drifting off.

JordonCon was amazing. Thank you to the Liangs et al for their wonderful and hard work, to all the guests who came, and to all of my fellow volunteers who helped keep things moving. I look forward to seeing all of you again at DragonCon, and I will definitely be back next year for JordanCon 2010. RJ may have left us, but we shall ensure his legacy continues, and perhaps even beyond the WoT universe. I foresee a whole cadre of authors that, through their own writing and own worlds, continue the work and vision that Robert Jordan laid down not for a world and story, but for the very concept of what a fantasy can be.

Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of Time!
