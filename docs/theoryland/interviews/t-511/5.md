# [Interview #511: Recap of JordanCon - Richard Fife, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#5)

#### Richard Fife

Day 2: Saturday

I wake up at six AM (don't ask why, I just did, no alarm), and get ready for the day. I then go down and eat breakfast with Jimmy, our blademaster and con security. From him, I learn that Tom Doherty is giving an interview for the Robert Jordan Documentary soon, and I weasel myself a spot in the room (only non-documentary staff in there) and take a listen. It was a wonderful interview, even with the falling light fixture, and I can say that when it comes out, it will be well worth the watch. I'm all the more glad to have seen this since I missed the pre-screening of other parts of the documentary later in the day.
