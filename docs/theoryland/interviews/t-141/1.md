#### Robert Jordan

If you want to be a writer, go be an accountant. If you want to write, write.

I know a lot of people who want to be a writer, and it's a very different thing from wanting to write.

It doesn't do any good to think about writing. It doesn't do any good to talk about writing. It doesn't do any good to go to caf√©s and sit there in your black turtle neck sweater with a coffee or beer and impress the girls with the fact that you are a writer, if what you have is the same three chapters sitting in a drawer that have been there for the last five years.

You write. You send it to a publisher. And when you've put it in the mail, you start writing again.

You send it to a publisher because the act of creation is not complete until you have an observer. It doesn't matter whether it's writing, or painting, or sculpting. If a painter sticks a painting in a closet, if a sculptor throws a drop cloth over the sculpture, the act of creation is not complete. Completion happens when you put it in front of an observer.
