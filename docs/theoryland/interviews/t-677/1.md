Guys, Jordan is a great man! He was most accessible and likable...he answered questions for over an hour and signed lots of books..think Dany R Snow presented four books to autograph and he good-naturedly signed all four.

Also notable was the presence of Luke Trugenberger who presented Mr Jordan. Luke is a really delightful and accessible person and if he keeps his promise will come to visit us on the Barrier...(At this point the purchase of his book is a must for me ... but I spent all my money on the 22 euro
*The Shadow Rising*
).

#### FOOTNOTEâ€”LINDA TAGLIERI

Both men are writers, but the poster probably means Luca, since the Italian translation of
*The Shadow Rising*
was published in 2004, the year of this post.
