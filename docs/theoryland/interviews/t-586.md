## [Entry #1](./t-586/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are two new interviews with me out there. First is
[this one at The Fringe](http://thefringemagazine.blogspot.com/2010/12/author-interview-brandon-sanderson.html)
, which covers some familiar ground with a few new questions. And then
[here's one at Stormblessed](http://www.stormblessed.com/2010/12/25/interview-with-brandon-sanderson/)
, which sheds some new light on details in
*The Way of Kings*
.

## [Entry #2](./t-586/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
are on the long nominees list for the 2010/2011 David Gemmell Legend Award. Last year,
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Warbreaker*
were both voted into the short list and ended up losing the final ballot to
*Empire*
by Graham McNeill. Anyway, there are a lot of worthy books on the list, so go vote for the one book you think deserves the award. You can only vote ONCE, and multiple votes will cause ALL of your votes to be discarded. Round two will be sometime after March.

## [Entry #3](./t-586/3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The most recent
*Warbreaker*
annotation is a
[long one](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/413/Warbreaker-Chapter-Thirty-Five)
. It covers a climax in Vivenna's plot, when she finds out what's really been happening with Denth. Don't read the annotation if you haven't read the book!
