Thanks for jumping on today Mr. Sanderson!

I just wanted to pop in and say you're one of the reasons I even read Wheel of Time. When I heard you were finishing the story up, I decided to take six months to read it. All I can say is thank you for finishing what Robert Jordan set out to do.

I guess since I'm here, I'll ask:

Which Wheel of Time character is your favorite now, and which one do you feel you identify with most?

Thanks again for doing this AMA, can't wait to meet you someday!

It was an honor.

My favorite now, after actually finishing the series, is Mat. But my favorite all time is Perrin, and he is the one I identify with the most.
