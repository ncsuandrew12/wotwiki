Wheel of Time question here. My understanding is that the title
*A Memory of Light*
refers specifically to a particular scene that actually happens at the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
. This has always bothered me that the title does not match up to the scene it references. Could you comment on this and how you decided to title the books?

The answer from the other poster is, in part, the correct answer. (I wrote most of TGS hoping I'd be able to publish the entire thing as one book.) However, philosophically, I always envisioned "A Memory of Light" to not mean any specific moment, but instead, the idea that the shadow was so strong upon the land that light had become but a memory--yet a very important one, driving people to seek it again and fight in the Last Battle.

Because of this, it felt as if the final book of the three was the right place to use the title. Beyond that, I'm pretty sure RJ would have wanted that title on the final volume of the three.
