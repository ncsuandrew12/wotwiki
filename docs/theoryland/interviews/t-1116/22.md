What kind of gaming do you do? Console? PC? Tabletop RPGs? Magic? Just curious!

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit)](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ytg2h/im_novelist_brandon_sanderson_ama/cpcx8mq)

All of the above.

Most recent game: Endless Legend, PC. Most recent console game: Dark Souls 2. Favorite Tabletop: West End's old Star Wars.

What's your favorite faction in Endless Legend? Would you consider doing some writing for it?

I actually have only had time to play two factions: Wind Walkers and Vaulters. Of the two, I preferred the Vaulters. I enjoyed the game a lot, but my time is limited, so I'm going to wait for some DLCS to change up the game before coming back to try another faction. The cultists are really intriguing to me.

I was disappointed that end of the faction quests didn't give story resolution to me, and that prevented me from feeling REALLY eager to jump into another faction until there's more of an ending. I was sad to not hear what happened to vaulters robot dude, for example.

Uhh any chance of some dark souls influence spilling into your books, or maybe not directly but thematically (a bit of grim-dark fantasy coming from you)? have you seen vaati vidya's videos about dark souls lore, they are amazing I highly recommend them?

I read the 4 mistborn books. After I'm done with Malazan (halfway through book 8), I plan on going back to your novels but everything seems to be connected and I don't know how to tackle the ecosystem you've created, it's kind of intimidating so what's your recommendation?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit)](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ytg2h/im_novelist_brandon_sanderson_ama/cpdanpi)

Don't worry too much about the connection; it's basically all easter eggs at this point. If you liked Mistborn, you could read Steelheart--which has a similar feel, and is completely unconnected to anything else. If you want something less intimidating, you could try Elantris or Warbreaker, which are both stand alone stories. But finish Malazan first for sure. :)
