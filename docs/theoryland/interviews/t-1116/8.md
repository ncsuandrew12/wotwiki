Hi Brandon, just one question for you today.

Out of the genres you haven't written in, which one do you really want to give a shot?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit)](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ytg2h/im_novelist_brandon_sanderson_ama/cpcsxgq)

Hmmm... Noir. Maybe true urban fantasy, though I have one unpublished manuscript in that genre, which means technically I have given it a shot.
