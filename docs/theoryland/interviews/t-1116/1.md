Hi Brandon! Love your work!

Quick question: I had a hard time "hearing" the Parshendi's singing in my head while reading
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Words of Radiance*
. Are there any real world examples you drew from you could give me so we have a better idea of what they sound like to you?

It was tough, as I didn't want to constrain their language in English to a certain rhythm, as I felt it would be too gimmicky on the page. I used Hindu chants in my head, though, so that might help.
