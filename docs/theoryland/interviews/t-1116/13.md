How do you come up with names for your characters? Sorry if you've been asked that before.

I use a variety of methods. In a deep worldbuilding piece, like The Stormlight Archive, I delve into actual linguistics and develop my own rules. But for many pieces, I look for something that feels right, and allow myself to be guided by the real-world linguistics of a culture in our world to give a "feel" for the culture.
