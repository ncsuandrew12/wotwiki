Hey Brandon! It was lovely interrogating hanging out with you in Chicago, so I'll keep this somewhat brief :)

[Cosmere] Can any two Shards be joined together, like "Preservation and Ruin", or does it depend on their Intents?
  
[Mistborn] What difference does Allomantic strength make when using gold/electrum, if any?
  
[Stormlight Archive] Have you planned out the interludes for Book #3, and if so - any returning characters? Share one?
  
[Fandom] Can you do another Q&A with The 17th Shard, so we can ask the good questions there? :P

Thank you for doing this - and everything else you do :)

Cosmere: Any can be joined, theoretically, but boy, some of the pairings would have an odd resulting pressure on the one holding them. And similar intents make for an easier time melding.
  
Stormlight: Yes, I have. Taravangian will be one, unless I move it to an actual chapter. We'll have to see how things play out.
