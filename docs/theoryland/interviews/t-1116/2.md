Hi Brandon! I fell in love with the first two Stormlight Archives and the Mistborn novels and I am making my way through the Cosmere. I have a few of questions for you:

1. What is your process for creating a system of magic?
  
2. If you could spend the day with any of the characters that you have created, who would it be?
  
3. If I mail you one of my books, will you sign it for me?
  
4. What are your thoughts on people getting tattoos based on your work?

Thanks again and keep on being awesome!

Thanks!

1. My essays on the Laws of Magic are probably the best place to start. (Just google "Sanderson's Laws.") The truth is, I'm just looking for something that twigs my imagination in an interesting way. A way to approach a science or fantastical element in a way I haven't ever read before.
  
2. Wayne would probably be hilarious, but the truth is probably Sazed. I could learn a thing or two, I'll bet.
  
3. Yes indeed! All you need to do is contact me through the webform on my website, and one of my assistants will send you instructions on how to get the book signed. I do this all the time.
  
4. I'm flattered.
