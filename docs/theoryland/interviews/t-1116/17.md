I picked up a signed paperback of Well of Ascension at the O'Hare airport last year while traveling for work.

Random question to you and other authors: do you ask permission to sign or do you just meander in and start signing your own books?

Have you ever been second-guessed when doing so?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit)](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2ytg2h/im_novelist_brandon_sanderson_ama/cpcwz59)

I do it half and half. At a good bookstore, like the ones in O'Hare, I will usually introduce myself. But at some airports, the bookstores are little more than news stands, and the people working there aren't always very alert. I doubt they hand-sell books, so it's just easier for both of us (and sometimes more fun for fans) if I just stealth sign and go.

I've been stopped once or twice, but usually with an "Oh, are you the author?" never a "What are you doing to those books?"
