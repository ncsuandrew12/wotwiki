# [Interview #1116: Brandon Sanderson - /r/books AMA March 2015, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1116#3)

It has been explained that all things exists between three realms: Physical, Spiritual, and Cognitive.

I have surmised that different things "exist more" in a certain realm than another though all things have some presence in the three. Humans appear to "exist more" in the Physical realm. Spren appear to "exist more" in the Cognitive realm (Shadesmar in SA). Investiture appears to have various forms in the Physical Realm (e.g., alomantic metals, mist, stormlight).

Question 1: Does investiture have a consistent form (regardless of magic system and its Physical form) in one of the other realms?

Question 2: Vasher has shown us that he can substitue his need for Breath with another investiture (presumably Stormlight). To what extent is investiture interchangeable between magic systems?

Question 3: Is investiture finite? Hemalurgy and a Return's need to consume breath seems to show us that it can be destroyed. If it is finite, is the Cosmere's magic source doomed to the law of entropy?

1. It's consistent in the Spiritual Realm. Location isn't particularly important there.
  
2. Very interchangeable, but not always simple to apply.
  
3. Investiture can not be created or destroyed. It follows it's own version of the laws of Thermodynamics.

So what happens to the investiture that is lost when a person is spiked and the spike isn't set in the new person immediately? Does it return to the big pool of investiture in the sky like the power from wheel of time where if its not actively being used it returns to the source?

What happens to someone's body when it's not being used by a particular person? The system is built to work like that.
