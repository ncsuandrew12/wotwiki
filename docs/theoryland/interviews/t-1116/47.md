Can you comment on
[this thread/question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/2yt1iz/spoilers_all_strategy_for_fighting_a_mistborn/)
, I'm very curious!

I like this strategy. Thinking outside the proverbial box. I think it has a good chance of succeeding, depending. Remember, emotional Allomancy is NOT mind control. And a duralumin-fueled blast of emotion is going to draw a lot of attention to itself, but will still be stunning. So yes, I'd say this is a valid method of taking on someone with atium.
