Hi Brandon! Thank you so much for doing this! I love your work, and I just had a couple questions regarding it...

1) I've heard somewhere that you already have a backstory for Hoid written, but you're waiting to release it as it would reveal too much about the Cosmere universe... is this true?
  
2) Do you ever plan on bringing different realms together?
  
3) Do you have a favorite series to write? Or is one more difficult to write than another?
  
4) What is your favorite book (or series) to read for pleasure (either by yourself, or another author)?

Again, thank you so much for doing this AMA, and I'm really looking forward to the rest of your work!

1) Yes, this is true.
  
2) Yes I do.
  
3) Stormlight is most difficult, but also the most fulfilling. Not sure if it's the most "Fun." It's a lot of work. But that's a good thing.
  
4) Anything by Terry Pratchett. (See my blog post today for more.)
