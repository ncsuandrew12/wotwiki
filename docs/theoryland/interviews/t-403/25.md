#### Question

I lived in Charleston during Hugoâ€”has that influenced you or the story in any way?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think your presence influenced me at all! As for the storm, it didn't influence me either, except that I have noticed sometimes, when the wind gets high, I climb up on the roof for no particular reason.
