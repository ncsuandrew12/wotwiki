# [Interview #403: AOL Chat 2, Entry #83](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=403#83)

#### Question

What is there to Lan's brother Isam, in the Waste? Is he a Darkfriend, or more?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out.

#### Footnote

Isam is Lan's cousin, and he has no connection to the Waste that we know of. He was merged with Luc to form Slayer, though, and in that form he killed Rand's father Janduin (but in the Blight rather than in the Waste).
