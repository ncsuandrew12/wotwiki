#### Question

Interesting parallels between your life and Heinlein, who also turned to writing after illness forced him from a military career. Mr. Jordan, how did you become interested in writing?

#### Robert Jordan

I was reading Mark Twain. I was five years old, and I wanted to make stories like that.
