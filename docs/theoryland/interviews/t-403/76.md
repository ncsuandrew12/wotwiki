#### Question

I was curious about your attitude towards women. They have a strong (Aes Sedai for instance) presence in your books. I am glad you break the stereotype of 'women in chains needs Conan type to help her'. When you get writers block, what do you do to get it back into form?

#### Robert Jordan

i'VE NEVER HAD WRITER'S (SORRY) blockâ€“but I've sometimes had caps lock.
