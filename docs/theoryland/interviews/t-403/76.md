#### Question

I was curious about your attitude towards women. They have a strong (Aes Sedai for instance) presence in your books. I am glad you break the stereotype of 'women in chains needs Conan type to help her'. When you get writers block, what do you do to get it back into form?

i'VE NEVER HAD WRITER'S (SORRY) blockâ€“but I've sometimes had caps lock.
