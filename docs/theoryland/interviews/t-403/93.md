#### Question

I'm sorry. How long after publishing
*The Eye of the World*
did you recognize the extent of the popularity of your book, and did you know at that time that the "World" would grow to such a great proportion (i.e., that you'd have written this many books)?

#### Robert Jordan

I never expected anything like this, and I really don't know how long it took me to realize that the books were very popular. It rather crept up on me.
