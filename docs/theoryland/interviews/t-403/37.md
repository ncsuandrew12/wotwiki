#### Question

When did you first develop the idea for Wheel of Time? How long had you been working on it before it was accepted by a publisher?

#### Robert Jordan

The very first notion came to me nearly twenty years ago; I spent ten or twelve years mulling it over, told my then-publisher about it, and he offered me a contract.
