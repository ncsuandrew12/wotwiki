#### Question

Who if any are Mr. Jordan's favorite authors?

#### Robert Jordan

Tad Williams, Robert Holdstock, Ray Feist, Janny Wurts, C. S. Friedman, Barry Hughart, and we'll cut it off there before it gets too long. I assume the last question meant in fantasy, because my favorite authors overall are Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austin. Austen. Sorry, Jane.
