#### Question

Am I seeing things that aren't there, or are there several references to the Arthurian Legends in the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, there are. Among many others. The Arthurian legend is the most recognizable in the United States. The others are much less so and you don't pick them out as easily.
