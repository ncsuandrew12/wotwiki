#### Question

Mr. Jordan, are there any fantasy writers, beside yourself, that interest you?

#### Robert Jordan

It's a moderately long list, but ... Tad Williams, Holdstock, Ray Feist, Janny Wurts, Barry Hughart, C. S. Friedman, and really that's just the beginning, the ones that come off the top of my head.
