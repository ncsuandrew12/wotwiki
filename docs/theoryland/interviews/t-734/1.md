# [Interview #734, Entry #1]: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - "Wars of the Future" with Robert Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=734#1)

#### The Faith Kamsha

The theme of "Wars of the future", raised to the fifth congress of Russian fiction, has an eerie, but not completely unexpected development. Now we do not see skyscrapers crumble before our eyes in the catastrophe movies, but in documentaries, and they have created no mythical King Kong, but one that is at least biologically related to the form of Homo Sapiens. Unfortunately, the science fiction writers were much closer to the truth than those who should have been able anticipate and prevent such events, if it was at all possible to prevent. Included among these authors is Robert Jordan, the author of the extraordinarily popular book series "The Wheel of Time", which is also a TV series in Russia. A veteran of the Vietnam War, Robert Jordan, speaks on the mechanisms and specific nature of 21st Century warfare.

In any case, Mr. Jordan's opinion about the past, present and future of the warfare seems to be very relevant and rather interesting.
