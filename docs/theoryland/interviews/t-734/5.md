# [Interview #734, Entry #5]: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - "Wars of the Future" with Robert Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=734#5)

#### Question

But the First World War, and even more—the Second World War quite clearly illustrate that this belief, i.e. the war will pass you by, is unsound.

#### Robert Jordan

This lesson was forgotten the next day. After completion of the Second World War something occurred, that was unprecedented in human history. We lived for fifty-five years without a global war. Offhand I cannot even recall another precedent, when some large nation went for a half-century without a major war. At least in Europe or America, I'm can’t cite any such instances.
