## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#1)

#### Awesomeness Summoned

I was at the Houston signing last night and recorded the entire book signing Q&A's. Some of these have already been posted above but here is all the WoB from the event. I left out most of the ones we already knew and some are paraphrased since they were hard to hear the exact wording but there was some good info last night. Enjoy!

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#2)

#### Question

Where was Pattern before Shallan drew him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was around. The bonding process had started when Shallan was young but then she pushed him away and he withdrew mostly to the Cognitive Realm until the bonding was started again and she pulled him fully into the Physical when she drew him.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#3)

#### Question

What is the Realmatic composition of Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Investure is intended to be the building blocks of the cosmere so I would say for the most part it transcends the different realms. Probably more of the Spiritual if anything but more accurately it transcends them.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#4)

#### Question

Were the heralds born on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#5)

#### Question

If Hoid were to hold an unsheathed Nightblood, would he feel sick?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Loud laughing) RAFO

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#6)

#### Question

Are the Ghostbloods accounted for in the Diagram?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Ghostbloods are in the Diagram.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#7)

#### Question

Why is Vasher on Roshar? Is he trying to get back Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kind of a RAFO. I won't go into all his reasons right now but there is one thing that was difficult to get on Nalthis that is much easier to get on Roshar. Going to Roshar solved that problem for him.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#8)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

Why did you put Nightblood in The Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood and Vasher were in the original version of the Way of Kings before I wrote Warbreaker. Warbreaker in a way was actually introducing those two characters I'd already created.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#9)

#### Question

Can you write an unknown ideal [in my book]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are still rough so this might not be the exact wording but: "I will stand when others fall."

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#10)

#### Question

How much more powerful is Nightblood than a a regular Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I haven't actually quantified that in my own mind so can't give an accurate comparison at this point. I will say that when he is fully consuming Investiture he can do some really freaky things.

#### Footnote

In the past Brandon has described Nightblood as being "magnitudes more invested than a shardblade".

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#11)

#### Question

If a non Windrunner picked up Jezrien's honorblade would they gain Windrunner powers as well?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

If a Windrunner picked up that blade, would their abilities be enhanced?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There would be some compounding but strength is not as much an issue with surgebinding as is the strength of the spren bond and how much Stormlight you are using.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#12)

#### Question

Why were all the shardblades swords when they can take on any weapon form they want? Would they all revert to swords when they die?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When they die they'd revert to the basic form which was a sword since they were patterned after honorblades.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#13)

#### Question

Feruchemists that can store Investiture, would they be able to then use that to power Allomancy with say stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#14)

#### Question

Lift is my favorite character even though she was only in that one chapter.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will see much more of Lift in the future. Lift is seeded there because she will be very important later on.

#### Footnote

Brandon has said that Lift will be one of the focus/flashback characters for the "back five".

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#15)

#### Question

Have we seen Cultivation's magic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#16)

#### Question

Is Hoid the most knowledgeable about what's going on in the cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, Khriss is the most aware by a long shot. Nazh knows a lot as well. Hoid might know more than Nazh but he is pretty in the know as well so it's close.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#17)

#### Question

Are the Parshendi of Odium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not originally.

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#18)

#### Question

Are the Parshendi of Cultivation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not originally.

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#19)

#### Question

Is the Nightwatcher a spren of Cultivation in a similar way that the Stormfather is to Honor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Nightwatcher is not Cultivation but is related. You're on the right track.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#20)

#### Question

Demoux is the only world hopper we've seen that inherently ages. Is there something about world hopping that makes someone not age?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are ways around that. It is not intrinsic to the process. You would need to do something special.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#21)

#### Question

Are there one or two shard pools on Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#22)

#### Question

Will there still be Hemalurgy in the Alloy of Law series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#23)

#### Question

Can a Hemalurgy chart be made?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. We will make one eventually.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#24)

#### Question

The ending of Mistborn was hidden in the first chapter epigraphs. Is there something similar to that in
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is, but they are hidden in different places. The last chapter of The Stormlight Archive is somewhere in these two books.

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#25)

#### Question

Is it possible to steal Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's theoretically possible.

## [Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#26)

#### Question

Is there a region based magic like Elantris on any of the other worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Aon magic is unique to that planet because it is intrinsic to the shard that created it, but you could theoretically hack the magic system so that AonDor would work on another planet.

## [Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#27)

#### Question

In the chapter 84 code, does the sequence 111 denote a special character such as a space between words

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not believe there is a 111 to separate words unless it was added by Peter when I wasn't looking.

Is this a question from the 17th Shard?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will say this, the key is in another epigraph.

#### Footnote

The code in question was decoded by Darmad of the 17th Shard

[17rh Shard](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/6398-wor-chapter-84-code/page-21?p=110247#entry110247)

## [Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#28)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

RAFO'd any questions about where the shardpools are.

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#29)

#### Question

Are the Parshendi of Honor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

## [Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#30)

#### Question

Can anyone other than a Parshendi bond a voidspren? Like, can a human bond a voidspren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is theoretically possible but humans are not good at bonding spren in the same way.

## [Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#31)

#### Question

How about the other way around? Can a Parshendi bond a KR spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Historically, the Parshendi were not made Knights Radiant, or the parshmen weren't.

#### Question

Can they become squires maybe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Historically they did not, but it's not impossible.
