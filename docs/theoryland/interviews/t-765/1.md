# [Interview #765, Entry #1]: Superstars Writing Seminar - Mark Grayson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=765#1)

#### Mark Grayson

I talked to Brandon last week at a quick signing he did for locals on his newsletter list after he was done with a writing seminar in Las Vegas.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He indicated that [Bayrd's POV] was not the part of this prologue that RJ wrote. Meaning that scene was his.

#### MARK GRAYSON

I thought he did a really good job with it. Very RJ-esque in my opinion.
