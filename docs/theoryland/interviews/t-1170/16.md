#### Question

When will Stormlight 3 come out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm hoping next Christmas. My original plan was to turn in the book by Spring so that Tor has 9 months to finalize it, but then the other day I got a call from Tom Doherty, the founder of Tor, and he told me that I could take till June if I wanted and it would still get a Christmas release. So I've got until June if I need it.

#### Footnote

This surprised me, as Peter has said on here that the process of taking a book's first draft and turning it into the product that sits on shelves takes about a year. So hearing that Tom Doherty said it could be done in 6 months for a book that's easily 2 or 3 times as large as normal, everyday books, was a bit surprising.
(note by Ted: it is now November 2016 and the first draft is 99% done)
