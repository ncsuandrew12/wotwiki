# [Interview #1170, Entry #3]: Shadows of Self - Lansing, MI](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1170#3)

#### Question

Okay. During the chase scene in Shadows of Self, it seems that allomancy follows conservation of momentum.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Allomancy does indeed follow the conservation of momentum.

#### Footnote

I thought this was obvious because Brandon's magic systems almost always follow physics unless noted otherwise, but I couldn't remember if it was ever confirmed for sure, so I figured I'd include it here.
