# [Interview #1170: Shadows of Self - Lansing, MI, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1170#4)

#### Question

Did you write all the pieces in the broadsheet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, actually I let a lot of my friends write the different pieces. \*lists names both from Dragonsteel Ent. and others\* It's really cool. Actually, Isaac, one of my artists, wrote the Allomancer Jak piece for Bands of Mourning, and it'll be the first time something he's written has been published. It's really good. You'll like it.
