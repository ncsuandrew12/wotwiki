This is about fabrials. In Elantris, you mention that the Elantrians have these Aon Tia plates. Using the same technique to make those plates, is it possible for Elantrians to make portable fabrials?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That...yes, that would be possible. But remember, the plates would get weaker the further from Elantris you get.
