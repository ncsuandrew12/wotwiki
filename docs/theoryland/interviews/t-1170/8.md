# [Interview #1170, Entry #8]: Shadows of Self - Lansing, MI](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1170#8)

#### Question

Are you thinking about making the Soonies and selling them in your store?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hah, actually yeah. What I hope to do is make a dog shaped doll, that you can flip inside out. And when you flip it inside out it turns into a Mistwraith. \*people all around who heard flip out (this was late into the signing, not much other background noise anymore)\*

#### Footnote

For the record, this was asked by one of the lurkers mentioned, and I told him to join and participate, so if you were planning on posting this yourself, sorry to steal your thunder!
