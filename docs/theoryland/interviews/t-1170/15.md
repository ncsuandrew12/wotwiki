# [Interview #1170: Shadows of Self - Lansing, MI, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1170#15)

#### Question

Why does Glys hide? Does it have to do with his bond or magic, or is it just his personality.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a little of both. His personality plays a big part, but there's something else too.

#### Footnote

When I do bother listening to the recording, I'll be looking for this one. I'm not confident I'm remembering the answer correctly, so take it with a grain of salt for now.
