# [Interview #1170: Shadows of Self - Lansing, MI, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1170#12)

#### Blaze1616

Does being an Elantrian make one feel like how Szeth describes holding Stormlight, or like how Vin describes holding the Mists?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*grins\* No, no it's a completely different feeling.

#### Blaze1616

I...see...

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*still smiling\* You know, no one asks about the Dor or Elantris. More people should be asking about the Dor. It's very important, and there's a reason why it's so different from the other systems.

#### Blaze1616

\*shocked face\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not...It's not some huge thing. It's not mind blowing. But there's a simple reason, and it reveals things about the Cosmere.

#### Footnote

He seemed very happy that three of my questions that night revolved around Elantris. I wanted to ask a couple more, such as if Hoid felt he should have been made an Elantrian because of the Moon Sceptre, but Brandon seemed to want to leave since the signing finished just a little after 11 rather than sometime after 12, so I said goodbye and left.
