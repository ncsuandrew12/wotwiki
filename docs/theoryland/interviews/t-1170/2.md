#### Blaze1616

Now that Wax's old earring is gone, could you reveal what it was allomantically charged with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*smile\* I'm not going to reveal which allomantic metal it was charged with right now.

#### Footnote

He seemed to hesitate before answering, and I immediately mentally hit myself for using the word allomantic, in case it's feruchemically charged, but then he repeated the word allomantic in his reply. Again, the above is paraphrased, but his response pretty much solidifies that the charge is allomantic in my mind.
