#### Blaze1616

You've revealed that the Shard Endowment is female, and in the book the Idrians refer to Austre as a male. Are they the same being?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*sly smile\* No, they are not.

#### Question

\*eyes widen\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

Who do you think Austre is?

#### Question

Well, my best guess would then be some ancient Returned.

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*smiles again\* That's a good guess.
