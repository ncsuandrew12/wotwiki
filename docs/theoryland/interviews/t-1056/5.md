# [Interview #1056: Brandon Sanderson gears up for release of latest novel, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1056#5)

#### Karen Hoag

What types of worlds do you create?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I create worlds that feel like our world, but not. I like the "but not." Fantasy is about the "but not," the "what is different, what couldn't be, but what do I maybe wished could be?" or "What do I wonder about?" There are things that come from my dreams and my imaginations and then I try to make them feel real.
