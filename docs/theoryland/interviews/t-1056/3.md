# [Interview #1056: Brandon Sanderson gears up for release of latest novel, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1056#3)

#### Karen Hoag

What do you think of the BYU signing for
*Words of Radiance*
? Are crowds different from location to location of your signings and appearances?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Provo has always been my biggest signing area from my very first book,
*Elantris*
. The biggest of the signings I've had was the one at the Waldenbooks, there in the Towne Centre Mall. Ever since then, I think, teaching at BYU, being a BYU alum (has helped) with crowds always being biggest in Provo.

But places I've gone repeatedly, there are these great bastions of fandom for me. Portland is always enormous and San Diego is always really good. These are places I've been going for years and years, but it's always the BYU signing that's the big one. We cap out often at 1,000 people at these signings which is very large for a book signing.
