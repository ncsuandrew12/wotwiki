# [Interview #1056: Brandon Sanderson gears up for release of latest novel, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1056#2)

#### Karen Hoag

Brandon, you are a celebrity and Utah County claims you. How do you feel about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I feel pretty good about it. I passed a milestone recently where I realized I had lived in Utah County longer than anywhere elseâ€”which may not seem like much of a milestone to you, but for years I was from Nebraska, transplanted to Utah. Now, I am from Utah with my origins in Nebraska.

Though the celebrity part, I'm not 100 percent sure about. As a writer, we get to do this thing we love and it's about the stories. It's not about us. I don't write these to be a celebrity. I write these so that I can tell the stories I want to tell, so I like the focus to be on the books and less on me.
