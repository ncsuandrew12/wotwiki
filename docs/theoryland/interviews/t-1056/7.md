# [Interview #1056: Brandon Sanderson gears up for release of latest novel, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1056#7)

#### Karen Hoag

All right. Who are you a fan of, maybe one who has inspired you? In what way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, the obvious answer is Robert Jordan who's been a big inspiration to me through my life. But I would say some of the most inspiring works I've read are the works of Victor Hugo. I love his abilities to characterize real people with all of their scratches and their flaws, but they are still heroic at heart. This is the sort of thing that I really love to read.
