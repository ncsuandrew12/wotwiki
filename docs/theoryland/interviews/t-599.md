and
[*Towers of Midnight*](http://genreforjapan.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/item-50-hardback-copy-of-the-gathering-storm-towers-of-midnight/)

A couple of years ago, I was an instructor at the
[Writing & Illustrating for Young Readers](http://www.wifyr.com/)
conference in Utah. I'm unable to do it again this year in June due to my Europe tour (more on that later as details are finalized), but it's a valuable experience if you want to break in to creating books for children.
[Instructors this year](http://www.wifyr.com/faculty.html)
include Louise Plummer and Holly Black, among others. The workshops are filling up fast, so it's a good idea to
[register](http://www.wifyr.com/registration/)
quickly.

Audible.com is once again putting on its
[Tournament of Audiobooks](http://www.audible.com/tournament)
, and
*Towers of Midnight*
is one of the competitors. The first round is underway, and so far
*Towers*
is narrowly beating out
*American Assassin*
. If you want to vote,

. (
*The Gathering Storm*
won last year's tournament.)

Suvudu has
[Vin up against Jon Snow](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/03/cage-match-2011-jon-snow-versus-vin.html)
in the semifinals of this year's cage match. Since Jon Snow hails from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, he's probably going to win. Which I'm perfectly fine with, as George is a true master of a writer. Besides, I really have no interest in seeing both Vin and Perrin winning their semifinal matches (Perrin will be pitted against Quick Ben from Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen, who is no pushover) and facing each other in the final.

This week's
[Writing Excuses podcast episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/03/27/)
features Larry Correia and Robison Wells joining Dan and Howard to talk about writing action scenes. The most recent
*Warbreaker*
annotation covers more on
[Siri and Susebron's relationship](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/426/Warbreaker-Chapter-Forty-Eight)
. And I have a new batch of
[Twitter posts](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/74/Tweets-March-21-March-25)
up.
