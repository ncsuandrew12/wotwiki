# [Interview #688: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=688#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Inquisitor at the end is indeed Marsh. He stayed alive using the same trick that TLR used.

#### ZAS

I said that I actually had a related question.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He said "Oh, do you want to ask why Marsh has a Feruchemical Atium spike?"

#### ZAS

I blinked, and said that my question was actually "Why did Bloody Tan see Ten-Soon (as the Survivor) and Marsh (as Ironeyes)?"

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He said that he was not answering any questions on what Bloody Tan saw, or thought he saw.

#### ZAS

I then said, "But now that you mention it, why does Marsh have a Feruchemical Atium spike?"

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He told me "You'll have to figure that out! Good job on getting two RAFOs in a row!"
