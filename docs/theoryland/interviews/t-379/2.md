# [Interview #379: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Alcatraz Revision Done!, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=379#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've begun to get pages back on the sections of
*A Memory of Light*
I sent to Harriet, and the responses are very encouraging. There are things I need to change, of course, but that's the case in any book. Mostly, she's asked me to be more descriptive in places. We've also got Alan and Maria working full time catching inconsistencies and the like. But I'm really enjoying the process. Harriet is a world class editorâ€”she really is great at what she does.
