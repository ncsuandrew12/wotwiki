# [Interview #386: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Tour Notes, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=386#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

First off, remember that I'm doing my first ever signing in New York City this Friday! This is a pretty big deal, as it's hard to get a signing in NYC. There are just too many important people wanting signings there, and it means that if you're a smaller author, you don't have much of a chance. However, it looks like I'm beginning to get a tad of attention, as my publicist was able to get me a signing. If you live in the area, please consider dropping by!
