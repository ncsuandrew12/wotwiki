#### Brandon Sanderson

One note for those of you who are interested in getting a copy of the issue of
*Asimov's*
SF Magazine in which I had a novella. It was in and out of stores before I realized it was there. (I didn't realize how quickly ahead of their 'on sale' month magazines often leave newsstands.) Fortunately, my friends at the Seattle University Bookstore rescued a few copies for me and had me sign them. If you want to get a signed copy, call the University Bookstore and ask for the Children's Desk. (It's the main help desk on the floor that also has SF.) Ask them for one of the signed copies of the October/November issue of
*Asimov's*
. If they're confused, then ask for Duane if he's there. But they should know what you're talking about.
