# [Interview #1112, Entry #15]: JordanCon 6 - Cosmere questions](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1112#15)

#### Question

Will you tell us a little about the sword from Warbreaker?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood is a weapon that I devised. He is partially inspired by my love of Michael Moorcock's writing. He was built into the cosmere using many of the foundational cosmere magic system things that exist on multiple worlds.
