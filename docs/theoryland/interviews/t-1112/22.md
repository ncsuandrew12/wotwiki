#### Question

Are we going to see any chapters that are expressly(?) Hoid now that he is becoming more and more important?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You have seen two. Are you going to see more? Yes. I would say that if you look at the structure of the first two Stormlight books, you will find several themes and those themes are likely to be repeated in future books. And Hoid does like having the last word.
