#### Question

Hoid mentions that no story is new, is repeated, this feels like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time overarching philosophy, any connection?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Certainly, though it is more a storyteller's connection. Storytellers know that the same stories are told over and over and we have just learned to interpret them differently for our different lives.
