# [Interview #1112: JordanCon 6 - Cosmere questions, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1112#27)

#### Question

Hoid mentions that no story is new, is repeated, this feels like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time overarching philosophy, any connection?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Certainly, though it is more a storyteller's connection. Storytellers know that the same stories are told over and over and we have just learned to interpret them differently for our different lives.
