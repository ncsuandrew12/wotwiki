#### Question

Why was the base form of Shardblades chosen to be blades, as swords?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's because the Shardblades were devised-- I can't spoil the second book-- They were devised as imitations of the Honorblades, which were created and given to the Heralds. So since the original pattern was the Honorblades, they were built to feel like the Honorblades.
