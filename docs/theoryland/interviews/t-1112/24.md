#### Question

Unknown question.

Hoid waxes poetic on the idea that the more people expect the harder it is on the artist. This is more the critic in me having noticed my own expectations for a piece play dramatically into how much I enjoy it

How someone who analyzes art like a critic in my analyzes art what would be an observation they would make. Hoid is not me and he does not voice necessarily my personal opinions but he is an artist and a critic so he notices some of the things I notice.
