# [Interview #637: Neth Space Interview: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=637#2)

#### Neth

A few years ago
[I had the privilege of meeting Brandon and spending a good bit of time with him](http://nethspace.blogspot.com/2009/11/my-evening-with-brandon-sanderson.html)
while he was touring for
*The Gathering Storm*
. He's a great guy and very easy to talk to. So, it was late one night when I finished reading
*The Alloy of Law*
and I was excited, I simply had to talk with someone about it (
[my review is here](http://nethspace.blogspot.com/2011/11/review-alloy-of-law-by-brandon.html)
). So, I got on the computer—however this was over a month before the official release date, and not many people had read the book and certainly no one was talking publicly about it. Naturally, I thought that it'd be awesome to talk with Brandon about it—of course we all know how busy he is wrapping up the Wheel of Time. So, next best thing, I set up an interview with him with the help of his ever-faithful assistant, Peter. I love that a long-lasting blog comes with such privileges. Anyway, the interview below is the result and it's almost entirely focused on
*The Alloy of Law*
. Of course since I didn't really want to spoil the whole book, we don't discuss everything that I wanted to, but this should give a nice taste of what
*The Alloy of Law*
has to offer. Warning, question 4 contains spoilers for the original
*Mistborn*
trilogy (Brandon mentions as much so there is a second warning).

Thanks again to Brandon for taking time out of his busy schedule to answer these questions and thanks again to Peter for making it happen. Enjoy!
