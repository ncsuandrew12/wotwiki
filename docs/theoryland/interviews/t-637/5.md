# [Interview #637: Neth Space Interview: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=637#5)

#### Neth

Wax is quite the archetype, complete with a side-kick and (potential) love interest. Where did he come from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't generally sit down and say I'm going to write someone who's this archetype or that archetype. What I wanted for this book, honestly, was just to have fun. I love writing epic, awesome stories; I love stories that are full of deep character conflict and broad world-spanning conflict—but sometimes I just want to back away from that and have fun.

The Wax archetype with the sidekick—the two of them were built from the ground up to be characters who played off one another well to facilitate good banter. Because I like to write good banter. I like to read it, I like to enjoy it. Whether it's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, or Holmes and Watson or whatever—I get a kick out of these types of stories. So when I was writing this book, I was really just saying let's step back for a little while from the kind of stories I was writing with
*The Way of Kings*
and the Wheel of Time—which are both (I hope) very awesome, and deep, and complex—and let's do something that's just fun.
