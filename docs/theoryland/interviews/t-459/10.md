# [Interview #459: TGS Signing Report - Paul Grow, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=459#10)

#### Question

Another fan asked if the balefiring of Graendal could bring back Asmodean, if in fact Graendal was the person who killed him.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon essentially said no, because it happened much too long ago. At best balefire burns someone out of the Pattern three days to a week at the absolute most. But usually more like five minutes.
