# [Interview #459: TGS Signing Report - Paul Grow, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=459#4)

#### Question

One fan said his favorite character was Padan Fain and ask if we would see more of him.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon responded that he could not say, but joked that he may or may not have been writing about him on the train.

#### Paul Grow

I laughed and said as I was typing that "Brandon said Padan Fain will be in the next book."

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon looked at me with little humor, saying "I did NOT say that."

#### Paul Grow

So let that be a warning to you and to me. I take full responsibility for this media report, I hope I get everything right but anyone can make a mistake or misunderstand something, so reader beware.
