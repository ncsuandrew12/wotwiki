# [Interview #459: TGS Signing Report - Paul Grow, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=459#2)

#### Paul Grow

I asked him a direct question: Where is Demandred? On whom or on what did the Dark One order him to use balefire in book 6? I answered my own question: Surely he is with the Borderlander Army waiting to use balefire on Rand directly. Rand would be burned out of the Pattern and the Pattern would unravel because it it couldn't exist without him. The Dark One wins.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said someone killed by balefire could be reborn and woven back into the Pattern later, but the Dark One cannot resurrect that person.
