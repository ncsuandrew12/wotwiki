#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon explained that the True Power can only be used by someone that the Dark One has allowed to use it. The True Power is perhaps more powerful than the One Power in the way a drugged up person is more powerful than someone not drugged up. In the moment the drugged up person may be, but in the long run maybe not.

Further explaining the True Power, he said the Guardian in Far Madding cannot stop it.
