#### Jennifer Liang

Friday 9/2/05:

The convention officially began at 1 PM on Friday. I ran the Opening Ceremonies, which was a recap of the last five years and some introductions. Turn-out was better than I expected, since Robert Jordan had his
[first signing](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196)
at the same time. It was followed by our
*New Spring*
discussion group.

#### Robert Jordan

Our big event for the day was a reading from
*Knife of Dreams*
by Robert Jordan. I had been told that it would be a reading from "Embers Falling on Dry Grass", the prologue that has been available for a few months in the
*New Spring*
paperback. However, Jordan surprised us by reading a section from somewhere in the middle of the book, which was a Mat POV. There are spoiler descriptions of the scene already posted on different sites, so I won't say more than that. Afterwards, he took questions from the audience.
