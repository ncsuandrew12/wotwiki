# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#14)

#### Jennifer Liang

After the sword forms, it was time for the Winespring Inn party, which featured performances by Three Quarter Ale and Jawarl Belly dancing troop, both of which are staples of the Renaissance festival/convention circuit in the south east. They packed in such a tight crowd that there was no room for audience participation games like we normally do. Oh well, next time we'll get a bigger room for this event. I kicked everyone out at midnight so I could go to bed. (Read: Help consume the leftover booze on the tenth floor until about three in the morning.)
