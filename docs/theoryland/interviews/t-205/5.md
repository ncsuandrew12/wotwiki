#### Jennifer Liang

Saturday 9/3/05:

Saturday kicked off bright and early with the fourth annual Dragon\*Con parade. Once again, I marched as the Amyrlin Seat. We had several Tinkers, a group of Asha'man, a Seanchan woman, Mat Cauthon, the Daughter Heir of Andor and dozens of Aes Sedai. We marched from Woodruff Park to the Marriott by way of Atlanta's legendary Peachtree Street. The highlight was marching past the Hyatt and seeing Robert Jordan and his wife sitting on the planters clapping and cheering for us. It was one of those beautiful, rare moments that stays with you forever.

Afterwards, we held a discussion group on the misunderstood cultures from the series, such as the Seanchan.
