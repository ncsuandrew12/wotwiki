# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#11)

#### Jennifer Liang

Sunday 9/4/05:

Sunday began quietly with a book discussion group and the fan art panel. The art panel had low turn out due to being scheduled against Robert Jordan's final signing.

However, things picked up again when we hosted a Q&A session with Robert Jordan and his wife. If you donâ€™t know already, Harriet is the editor of the series. She is probably the only person who knows as much about the series, including background details, as he does. They are also very much in love with each other, even after all the years of living and working together. They pick on each other constantly.

#### Harriet

The big reveal of this session is that Harriet's next project, after she is done editing the next book in the series will be to take all of Jordan's background notes and edit them together into a complete "Wheel of Time Encyclopedia", with the complete Old Tongue dictionary, glossary of every term that appears in the books and character and setting information. Applause broke out when she said that. You can read another partial transcript here: http://p079.ezboard.com/ftheorylandfrm30.showMessage?topicID=6.topic
