# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#10)

#### Jennifer Liang

The other important event of Saturday was the first annual Gleeman's Competition. We only had two contestants this year, so we asked them to just perform one piece from their repertoire (They were required to participate in three events: story telling, music, and hidden talent). Melissa from TarValon.net performed slight of hand tricks and Ben from Dragonmount read an original story about Gaidal Cain he had composed. There was a little bit of random performances by people in the crowd after that, and we disbanded. We'll try this competition again next year, as I still believe there is enough talent in the WoT fandom for something like this to happen.
