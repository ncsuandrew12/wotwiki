#### Jennifer Liang

My personal favorite moments this year are walking in the parade and having the Jordans cheer for us, being given a "thank you" gift from one of the fans of the track (I still have my red hand sticker in my purse, Brian. I haven't decided where to stick it yet.), wearing silk pjs, bunny slippers and my stole to three consecutive drinking parties, and walking with the Jordans while they went shopping in the Dealer's Hall. We had a GREAT convention this year and I can't wait until I see everyone again in 2006.

Now I'm going back to bed.
