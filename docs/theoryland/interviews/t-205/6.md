# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#6)

#### Robert Jordan

The next big event was the formal interview with Robert Jordan, conducted by Dragonmount's own Shannan Lieb (Serinia Latar, Head of the Gray Ajah).

#### Jennifer Liang

I'm currently trying to get a copy of the video Dragon\*Con made of this event and permission to post it online. However, in the meantime, the good people at Theoryland.com made their own tape and have put a transcript online here. http://p079.ezboard.com/ftheorylandfrm30.showMessage?topicID=1.topic

This was notable as the first time I have ever had people lining up outside a room for an event I put on at Dragon\*Con. There were about three hundred people patiently standing in the lobby of the Hyatt waiting for Tech Ops to finish turning the room over to us. It was something I had to get used to quickly that weekend.
