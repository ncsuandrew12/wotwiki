Thursday 9/1/05:

Thursday is not officially part of the convention. However, so many people have become Dragon\*Con savvy over the last few years and realized that early arrival is the way to go, that it might as well be. Thursday afternoon was spent hanging our new flags in the Kennesaw conference room of the Hyatt and meeting all the WoT fans coming from out of town. I had dinner that night with the Dragonmount group, which turned into a big gossip session. ("Remember that crazy chick that used to post back in 1999...") That night I split my time between the TarValon.net Pants Free Party and a group of noisy, drunk WoT fans on the tenth floor lounge of the Marriott. We were there until the hotel staff asked us to leave.

Remember the tenth floor. It pops up frequently.
