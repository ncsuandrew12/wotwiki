After that we had the fifth annual Wheel of Time Costume Contest, with celebrity judges Teresa Patterson, Harriet McDougal and Robert Jordan. We had our largest turnout yet for this event, with over twenty contestants and several hundred people in attendance.

The winner of the Master category was Melissa Craib and Ben Gunderson for their portrayal of a Green sister and her Warder. I forget the name of the winner of the Novice category, but the costume was a Keeper raised from the Brown Ajah. Other notable costumes include a member of the Deathwatch Guard, Elayne Trakand, two Myrrdraal and several Mat Cauthons. It was an excellent year for costumes.
