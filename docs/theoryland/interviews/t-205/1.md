# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#1)

#### Jennifer Liang

Robert Jordan was the Guest of Honor for Dragon\*Con 2005, which was recently held in Atlanta, Georgia. For the last five years I have had the honor of serving as the Director of Wheel of Time programming at this convention. Though Robert Jordan was a guest of the convention in 1996, this is the first time he has attended while I've been associated with it. We also had cover artist Darrell K. Sweet, Teresa Patterson, co-author of the Guide, and Les and Ernst Dabel, producers of the
*New Spring*
graphic novel as guests.
