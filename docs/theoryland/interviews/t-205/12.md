# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#12)

#### Jennifer Liang

Our next big event was a presentation by the Dabel brothers regarding their production of
*New Spring*
.

#### Dabel Brothers

They showed us previews for the next few issues and explained the collaborative process that creates the comics.

First the adapter, Charles Dixon, writes a script that meets with Robert Jordan's approval. Then the artist begins drawing sketches, which are submitted to a panel of fan consultants who check them for accuracy and the general "feel" of the series. After they are checked again by Robert Jordan, they are sent to the colorist and sent to the consultants for approval again. If everything checks out, the letterer adds the dialogue and captions and they are sent on for publication.

They also announced that based on fan feedback for their first limited edition collector's print of Mat Cauthon, they will be releasing a series of computer wallpapers featuring the characters from the main series. These are still in development, but from what I've seen so far, they should be excellent.
