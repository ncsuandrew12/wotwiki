# [Interview #205: DragonCon Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=205#9)

#### Jennifer Liang

Immediately following that, we had a Q&A session with Teresa Patterson.

#### Teresa Patterson

Teresa, as always, was a very funny, interesting lady to talk to. She spoke about some of her upcoming projects and her work as a balloon sculptor.

She explained that the Guide was written with deliberate inaccuracies. One of the reoccurring themes of the series is that people donâ€™t necessarily know all they think they do, but still have to make decisions based on what they know. They decided the book would be written from the point of view of a historian who had good, but not necessarily great information on a variety of subjects. So Jordan withheld information from her while she was writing the book, or he would tell her things, but then ask that she not include it.

She said that she would love to work on another project like this again, but that was up to the publishers.
