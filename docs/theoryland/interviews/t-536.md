Peter here again. Brandon is back from his tour, but he's been very active online everywhere except his own website, it seems! First up, last weekend John Scalzi's Whatever blog featured a guest post essay by Brandon entitled
[Postmodernism in Fantasy](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/09/12/postmodernism-in-fantasy-an-essay-by-brandon-sanderson/)
. For people confused about what that might cover, let me say it involves a Jewel music video. (Okay, I know that doesn't help. Just go read it.)

To follow that up, Brandon is joined by hit fantasy writer Brent Weeks over on the Babel Clash blog for this week (and I think next week too), posting back and forth at each other. Brent played off Brandon's Whatever essay and they went from there, talking about foreshadowing, deus ex machina, and other writing concepts.

Three different interviews mostly about
*The Way of Kings*
have gone up recently, from seven prominent review bloggers who pooled questions in three separate groups and submitted them to Tor. I asked Brandon these questions right before his tour started, and his recorded answers took eighty minutes of audio. So they're pretty detailed and interesting. Check all of them out.

Tomorrow Brandon will be appearing at the Orem Barnes & Noble Authorpalooza, with over 40 other local authors including people like (um, I can't find a comprehensive list, so I won't guarantee this): Dan Wells, Brandon Mull, Jessica Day George, James Dashner, etc. The address is on Brandon's events page. It's at 1:00, so if you're nearby, grab all your books and head down there.

And if you look at that events page you'll notice that the book tour for
*Towers of Midnight*
has been arranged, and Harriet McDougal will be accompanying Brandon in every city this time around. It's going to be a shorter tour; Brandon has spent over half a month on tour already and needs a bit of a break. He does plan a much longer tour when
*A Memory of Light*
comes out; Brandon has some ideas about how to make that the best tour ever for the fans. But that's a long way off; Brandon still has to write the book! In any case, for those who will ask, yes, there will be a "Storm Leader"-type program for the
*Towers*
tour; keep your eyes peeled on Dragonmount for details on the Tower Guards program.
