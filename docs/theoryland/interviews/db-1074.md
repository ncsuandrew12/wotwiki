-- [17th Shard (Report)](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/6497-word-of-brandon-from-huntington-beach-signing/#entry105706)


## Entry #1

#### ericth

What is Odium's edge. Vin and Ati killed each other but Rayse has downed 3 shards and survived. Was it skill, ability, numbers or possibly un-dispersed power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some combination of the above.

## Entry #2

#### ericth

Could Sazed take down Rayse since he has two shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Rayse is VERY scared of Sazed. However, given Sazed is a composite of two diametrically opposed shards, he finds it very difficult to act.
