## Entry #1

#### Tim Kington

I was at the signing in Dayton, OH on Friday. The signing followed the pattern of the others that have been reported lately, but there were a few interesting things I had not heard before. Cautionâ€”spoilers ahead.

## Entry #2

#### Question

When Rand hears Lews Therin, is this happening across time, or are they both in the present?

#### Robert Jordan

They're both in the present.

## Entry #3

#### Question

Will there be a WOT movie?

#### Robert Jordan

There may be. Right now RJ has on his desk some kind of outline, which is one of the first steps in developing a screenplay. Red Eagle Entertainment has the rights.

## Entry #4

#### Robert Jordan

He really doesn't like Apple. It was hard to hear this answer, but he was saying something about how he started writing on the Apple II, and when he switched to Apple 3, the file formats changed, and he couldn't get to any of his data. The same thing happened again when he moved to the Mac, and so he swore he would never buy anything Apple again. He says the only thing from Apple that he uses now is Quicktime.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Was the gizmo used to capture Elayne a shocklance?

#### Robert Jordan

It was a variation. A shocklance is more like a rifle, and this was more like a pistol.

## Entry #6

#### Question

What software do you use to write?

#### Robert Jordan

WordPerfect 9. Word sucks. He went on to explain several of the lame things about Word. The one that I remember is that if you import things from WordPerfect, it screws up the fonts.

## Entry #7

#### Question

Were the Kin inspired by some real-life group?

#### Robert Jordan

No, as far as I know, I made them up.

## Entry #8

#### Question

Was Mat's use of crossbows in
*Knife of Dreams*
based on the way crossbows were really used?

#### Robert Jordan

The thing that made crossbows better than longbows was that you could train someone to use a crossbow much faster than you could train them to use a bow. Then when muskets came along, they were better because they didn't require much training, and the firing rate was improved.

## Entry #9

#### Question

What are female Trollocs like?

#### Robert Jordan

They are basically breeding machines. They give birth to litters, and are quite fierce in defense of their children.

## Entry #10

#### Question

Were the Dragon Banner and the Horn of Valere made at the same time?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Question

Then why did Hawkwing need Rand to produce the banner at Falme before he could attack?

#### Robert Jordan

Legends change.

## Entry #11

#### Question

Why can't Shadowspawn pass through gateways?

#### Robert Jordan

It's because they're artificial constructs. They can't tolerate the passage.

#### Question

So would a Nym have the same problem?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Question

How about Ogier?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Ogier are not artificial constructs.
