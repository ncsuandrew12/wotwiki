# [Interview #1100: Firefight Signing Report - Fletchershair, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#8)

#### fletchershair

Is there any chance of queer characters later on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There already are some; Drehy the bridge man is gay and Ranette is some form of queer[he specified it, but I couldn't tell what he said and I had already asked loads of questions and the line was long]. There will definitely be more.

#### Footnote

Brandon has previously mentioned that there is a lesbian in
*The Alloy of Law*
, presumably Ranette.
