#### Tom Burke

I introduced myself as an internet user. I told him that some on the net seemed to think that every other person was a Darkfriend. He replied, "I've heard". I told him that my feeling was that the number of Darkfriends in Randland were probably between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000.

#### Robert Jordan

He replied, "Closer to the later, of course we see more of them because of the
*ta'veren*

#### Tom Burke

#### Robert Jordan

He responded, "Yes, of course."
