# [Interview #41: LOC Signing Report - Tom Burke, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=41#5)

#### Robert Jordan

We talked a bit about the Aiel culture. Robert constantly referred to the Amer-Indian, Arab, and African cultures. In particular, how come they don't show signs of being malnourished? "Belly dancers live in the desert and yet, have been known to be full bodied. It is the people who have had their fields burned that might be a little malnourished."
