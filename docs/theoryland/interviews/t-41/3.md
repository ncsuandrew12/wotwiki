# [Interview #41: LOC Signing Report - Tom Burke, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=41#3)

#### Tom Burke

I asked if the Aiel attacks were done by the Shaido and their allies.

#### Robert Jordan

He responded, "If someone thinks otherwise, they should read the books."

I stated that twenty Darkfriends would be a heavy investment to lose all at once. Jordan replied, "Not at all. It's very easy for me to make some more. It is their trustworthiness that is more of a problem."
