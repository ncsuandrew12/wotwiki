Hey dudes, I have some interesting factoids for you. So, I always make sure to order a signed book from Sam Weller's (now Weller's Bookworks) and ask some sort of ridiculous cosmere question. I strongly believe I've posted what was signed in my Alloy of Law copy, but I honestly can't find it (though it was referenced in one of the first Shardcasts: http://www.17thshard...-is-not-a-d-r91). So, I guess I'm posting that too, again.
In Alloy, I asked: "Give us the name of a Shard's intent we have not seen before."

There is one who just wants to hide and survive.

In Emperor's Soul, I asked: "Is the reason why it is hard to get to Shadesmar on Sel because Devotion and Dominion being Splintered?"

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/2652-clues-in-signed-things/#entry46099)

That is part of it (a little).
Then, hidden later in the book: "Has to do with the name of that expanse."
