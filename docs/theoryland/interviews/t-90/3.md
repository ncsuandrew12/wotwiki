#### Question

A reader asked when the term "Ajah" came to have the meaning it has in Rand's time.

He said that until at least 500 years after the Tower was founded, it meant a temporary association for a specific purpose, and was a lower-case noun. Its proper-noun sense arose afterwards, supplanting the earlier usage after the Trolloc Wars.
