#### Question

A reader asked when the term "Ajah" came to have the meaning it has in Rand's time.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that until at least 500 years after the Tower was founded, it meant a temporary association for a specific purpose, and was a lower-case noun. Its proper-noun sense arose afterwards, supplanting the earlier usage after the Trolloc Wars.
