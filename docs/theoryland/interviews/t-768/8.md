**AonDor**

This Aon has a powerful and unusual AonDor counterpart. A properly drawn Aon Ene puts forth a light, known by many as the Light of the Mind. When sitting in this Aon's light, one's mental abilities are enhanced. The Elantrian—or anyone else who happens to be close to the Aon—can memorize more quickly, think more clearly, and stave off mind-clouding effects of tiredness and sickness.

Used in conjunction with other Aons, Aon Ene is what is known as a "linking Aon." Using it properly in the Aon equation will link subsections of Aon lists together, coordinating which effects take place at which times during the Aon list's progression. It is an important Aon to learn to use well for complex Aon linkings, and no true AonDor master is without substantial practice in its use.
