#### Brandon Sanderson

Finally, I haven't posted one of these in a while, so here's an
*A Memory of Light*
relative progress list update!
*A Memory of Light*
has passed up
*Warbreaker*
,
*Winter's Heart*
, and
*Hero of Ages*
—and it's within one more percentage point of
*The Dragon Reborn*
. You can rest easy that, no matter what else happens, at least this won't be the shortest WoT book in the main series. :)
