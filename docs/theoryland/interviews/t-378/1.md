# [Interview #378, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Annotation + Random Notes](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=378#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

First off, I've posted a new
*Well of Ascension*
annotation:
[Chapter Forty-Four](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/236/Mistborn-2-Forty-Four)

Secondly, there's another website that is sponsoring a giveaway of my books, this one by the FantasyBookCritic blog. They're giving away an entire Mistborn trilogy set.

Thirdly, we've sold about 75 of the 100
[copies of Mistborn Two I have up for sale](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/store/item/23/Signed-Mistborn-Book-2%E2%80%94%E2%80%94Hardback)
. These probably won't last another week, so hurry up if you want one.

Fourthly, I received a nice email from some folks who have started up a Mistborn Fansiteâ€”the first one I know of. It's call Mistborn Empire. Thanks, guys! You flatter me.
