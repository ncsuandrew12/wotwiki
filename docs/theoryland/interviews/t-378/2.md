# [Interview #378: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Annotation + Random Notes, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=378#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Fifthly, I've finished the revision of
*A Memory of Light*
Part One, which tops out at around 250,000 words. I then sent that chunk off to Harriet for review. A lot of you have emailed to ask me what she thought of what I'd written so far. Well, this is the first sizable chunk of writing she's seen on the book, so the honest truth is that I don't know yet! I'm nervous, as can be expected. It could be months before she gets back on those pages, though. 250k is a LOT of writing. In a lot of genres, that alone would be nearly three books worth of material. Here, it's just one portion of the novel.

Sixthly, that means it's time for me to zip on over and finish the two other edits I need to do this year. I warned you about these back in June. One is the
*Warbreaker*
Copyedit, the other is the
*Alcatraz*
Three final draft. I dove into
*Alcatraz*
last night, and the revision is going very quick and easy. I suspect that I'll be done with it by the end of the week, or early next week at the latest. The
*Warbreaker*
edit will take a tad longer, but I plan to be done with it by the
[time I leave on tour](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/696/Hero-of-Ages-Book-Tour!)
. That leaves me with two and a half months to finish the other 150k of
*A Memory of Light*
and meet my goal of 400k by December. It's doable, but will be close, with the book tour distracting me. Keep an eye on the website to watch and see if I make it!
