#### TsorovanSaidin

Just got done at the Salt Lake signing!

My buddy and I drove 7 hours for this. I got the last question at the Q&A too! Brandon talked to us for a good five minutes, since my buddy and I were the only two to bring leather bounds in, being 2 of the only 125 made for the public, he was very impressed and took the time to make sure the personalizations were special. I wrote Lan's "I am just a man, that is all I have ever been." He liked that so he wrote it.

For my buddy he wrote in there "there are neither beginnings not endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time, but it was an ending."

He was really impressed that we both brought a leather bound. In my ToM I threw in "it's time to toss the dice." And he goes, "do you want it in Old Tongue?" I about freaked out. That man is a true fan. And in my hard backed AMoL I asked him to put the Androl quote I wrote in there, and he was happy to oblige. Needless to say it was a good night. They also had Wheel Of Time iPhone cases and I'm getting one of those.
