Was anything new revealed during the Q&A?

#### TsorovanSaidin

Not really.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He said Androl was strictly him, no sorta fan shout out. But as fans, we all sorta have those things we see as "should be" possible. And for Brandon, Androl was like playing Portal. That's why Androl came across as such a real character. Androl Is Brandon thrown into the world.
