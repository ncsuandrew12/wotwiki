# [Interview #1003: AMOL Signing Report - TsorovanSaidin, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1003#3)

#### TsorovanSaidin

The only other thing we asked him was about a certain lighting of a pipe.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He said that he has no idea what the ending with Rand lightning the pipe truly meant. That was completely RJ. I asked him, based on my own theory, that what Rand did was a by product of him being almost a convergence of the Pattern. Since he wove with all three powers and wove the whole of the Age lace that he was now able to bend the Pattern and essentially "weave reality." Which would be more far helpful than the One Power. It may also explain why he's burnt out and not going crazy because of, he has a far better substation.

#### TsorovanSaidin

Pops! Forgot to add! Brandon said he doesn't know for sure but, that is close to his own theory. And they ARE releasing the complete encyclopedia on the series. He estimates by sometime next year.
