## [Entry #1](./t-1136/1)

#### Cadmium

Well, yes. hmm. We... we've seen someone with a hemallurgic spike communicate or under the control of Ruin or Harmony. Can other spikes communi, sorry no people, well Shards... ugh so nervous." (Trying to get it accurate.)
Brandon looks a little confused at me, but smiles.
"Can other \*Shards\* communicate or control those individuals?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Good Question. Yes... \*scribbles\* They can certainly communicate...

#### Question

(I excitedly, but rudely, interrupt a bit) To what extent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

not to the extent that Ruin did. The others could communicate but it'd be vague or faint, not as direct as Ruin was. He connects to us, well, them through the little bit of Preservation that he had or could touch. Because the spike pierces the soul.

#### Question

What about on other planets than Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It'd work the same way. but again probably vaguer or fainter. Might go unnoticed.

#### relient23

Are the lines that an Allomancer sees when burning iron or steel are in the physical realm, the spiritual realm, or the cognitive realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"It is more spiritual realm than anything."

## [Entry #3](./t-1136/3)

#### relient23

If you're burning atium, can you predict the trajectory of an atium (atium, not aluminum) bullet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Atium? Yes. But aluminum... Maybe not so much sly smile"

## [Entry #4](./t-1136/4)

#### Eadwina

Will we ever get to see or experience the cognitive realm on any other planets to the extent that we have on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Are there inhabitants there like there are in Shadesmar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

...yes.

#### Tags
