# [Interview #429: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: The Gathering Storm coming sooner than expected, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=429#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I got home late last night from Worldcon, where Howard Tayler was beaten to the Best Graphic Story Hugo Award by the much-deserving Phil and Kaja Foglio with
[Girl Genius](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/)
. Congratulations!

In
[this week's Writing Excuses episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/08/08/writing-excuses-season-3-episode-11-trimming/)
Howard, Dan, and I talk about trimmingâ€”tightening your prose and reducing word count without changing your story. And while at Worldcon we recorded three episodes with the puppeteer and Campbell-winning writer
[Mary Robinette Kowal](http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/)
, so that's something to look forward to in upcoming podcasts.

And since it's Tuesday, a new Mistborn 3 annotation has gone up and I have three links to give you:
[Part One Wrap-Up](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/275/Mistborn-3-Part-One-Wrap-Up)
,
[Chapter Fourteen](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/276/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fourteen)
, and
[Chapter Fifteen](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/277/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fifteen)
. The beginning of Part Two is when Spook shows up, so these are chapters I particularly like. It's more setup, but with a more epic scope like
*Hero of Ages*
has, more setup is necessary.
