# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#19)

#### Week 19 Question

How far can a channeler Travel with the One Power? I know they can Travel anywhere on the globe, and enter
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
through a slightly different weave, but is it possible to Travel to other planets, or even planets in other galaxies?

#### Robert Jordan

Travel to other planets within the solar system would require a circle of fairly strong channelers, though not necessarily as many as thirteen, depending on exactly how far out they wanted to go. Travel to a planet in another solar system would require a rather large circle (of the maximum possible size) of very strong channelers, and there would a limit on how far they could go in one jump. They could planet-hop, of course. Travel to another galaxy would be beyond them even if they began on the planet in this galaxy nearest the target galaxy.
