# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#22)

#### Week 22 Question

How many people have you met that have named their children or pets after characters in your books?

#### Robert Jordan

A fair number, though I haven't kept count. I'd say a couple of dozen, at least. Whether there are any who I haven't met, and who haven't written to tell me, I couldn't say, of course.
