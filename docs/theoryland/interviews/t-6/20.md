# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#20)

#### Week 20 Question (LordJuss)

Why was Aginor so interested in the Eye of the World? He could channel clean
*saidin*
anyway so it shouldn't have been an issue?

#### Robert Jordan

He was able to channel clean
*saidin*
, true, but only through the "filter" which had been provided by the Dark One just a short time previously, which meant the Dark One would be aware of him channeling wherever he was. Remember, Aginor was the creator of the Trollocs; he is quite able to reason things out clearly, at least in a scientific sense. Also, he wasn't certain whether or not the Dark One also would know what he was doing when he channeled, too. For someone as secretive, competitive, and generally untrustworthy as the one of the Forsaken, the Eye of the World amounted to a valuable asset if it could be secured. To put it simply, Aginor saw a means of channeling without the Dark One looking over his shoulder, and maybe a way to increase his own power at the expense of those who didn't have that advantage. Balthamel might well have been for the long drop, administered by Aginor, if things hadn't worked out differently.
