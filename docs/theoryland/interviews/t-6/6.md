# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#6)

#### Week 6 Question

How were the
*Gholams*
made? Were they created or bred like the Trollocs? How exactly are they controlled if they are immune to the One Power?

#### Robert Jordan

The
*gholam*
—singular and plural are the same—were created, not bred. Supposedly their creation involved making them so that they would be obedient to the Chosen, whoever they might be at any given time. This was an attempt at copying something that had turned up in Myrddraal, which seem incapable of disobeying one of the Chosen, possibly because of the use of the True Power in creation of the Trollocs, the parent stock of the Myrddraal. Even Aginor, who created the Trollocs, and thus indirectly the Myrddraal, was uncertain about the actual cause. (Becoming one of the Forsaken involves receiving a mark from the Dark One in return for your oaths; this mark is invisible and cannot be sensed by another human being, even another of the Forsaken, but it can be by certain non-human creatures, including Myrddraal and Draghkar among others. This may play a part in the Myrddraal's obedience but doesn't explain it completely.) This element in
*gholam*
has some flaws, however, as we have seen in a small measure. In any case, if I were you, I wouldn't try giving orders to a
*gholam*
unless I were one of the Forsaken.
