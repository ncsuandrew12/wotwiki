# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#2)

#### Week 2 Question

The other big murder mysteryâ€”Ispan and Adeleas. Have you given us sufficient clues in the books that you think we should be able to figure out this one? Any hints on where to look?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I haven't given you enough information to solve the murders of Adeleas and Ispan, but they will be solved in
*Knife of Dreams*
. How's that for a hint?

#### Footnote

There were hints, such as Careane showing her face at the Kin's farm, but there were also red herrings pointing at Sareitha.
