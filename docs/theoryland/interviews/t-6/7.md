#### Week 7 Question

What was the most respected Talent in the Age of Legends? Why?

#### Robert Jordan

Healing was probably the most respected single Talent in the Age of Legends, in part because it eased suffering (disease had been all been eradicated, but injuries still occurred) and in part because high levels of ability in that Talent were much more rare than high levels in most other Talents.

#### Footnote

Healers were known as Restorers in the Age of Legends.
