# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#3)

#### Week 3 Question

How do the Seanchan Ogier cope with the Longing, given that their duties in the Deathwatch Guard take them overseas? Are there many
*stedding*
in Seanchan?

#### Robert Jordan

There are many more
*stedding*
in Seanchan than there are in the part of the world where the story is taking place, and that is why the Seanchan Ogier don't suffer from the Longing. Because there are so many more
*stedding*
, they were able to find them more easily even during the Breaking and therefore never had the very extended separation that Ogier on this side of the Aryth Ocean had, though they seldom were able to settle in one for very long until the Breaking ended.
