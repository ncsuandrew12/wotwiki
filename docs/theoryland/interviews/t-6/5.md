# [Interview #6: TOR Questions of the Week Part II, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=6#5)

#### Week 5 Question

Will Hurin the Sniffer return in any of the remaining books? Please? We miss him. Could you share some insight as to why you decided not to use him after
*The Great Hunt*
?

#### Robert Jordan

He'll turn up again. He hasn't reappeared earlier because the part he had to play was a sidelight to the main story. You should be able to glean some of what he was doing, what effect he and the news he brought was having, from the news that came out of the Borderlands in the books following
*The Dragon Reborn*
, though.
