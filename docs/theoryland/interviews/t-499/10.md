# [Interview #499: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#10)

#### Luckers

If you had to name a single moment and a single plotline that was your favourite, what would they be? You're only allowed one. \*grins evilly\*

#### Maria Simons

Your evil grin is wasted. This one is easy. I have a favorite chapterâ€”chapter five of
*Lord of Chaos*
, "A Different Dance." There is just so much classic Mat in that chapter: when he can't keep up with Betse's mouth and Talmanes hums "A Frog on the Ice", his dance with Betse with the memories from just before the Trolloc Wars, taking out the Hunter of the Horn with a low blow, and so much more. I absolutely love that chapter. It may have been that chapter that cemented the love for Mat.
