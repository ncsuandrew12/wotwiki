So that's about it. I want to say thanks again to Maria for putting up with me—it was amazing to get such an insight into Team Jordan, and the process that led to us getting these amazing books, and on behalf of all the fandom thank you for your work on the series—I feel very comfortable knowing the ending is in the hands of such a dedicated group of people!

Thanks, also, to Jennifer Liang, our very own Kathana, for helping me in this. It would not have happened without her!
