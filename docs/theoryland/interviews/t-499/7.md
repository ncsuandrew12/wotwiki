# [Interview #499, Entry #7]: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#7)

#### Luckers

Brandon said that as much as he was terribly excited to be involved in finishing the Wheel, there was an element of sadness as a fan to not be coming to the final product fresh. Is that true for you also?

#### Maria Simons

Yes, it is. I would have loved to see how Jim put it all together. The sadness is ameliorated somewhat by the fact that I got so much from Jim himself in his last days, and that Brandon did such an amazing job with
*The Gathering Storm*
, and is a joy to work with.
