# [Interview #499: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#1)

#### Luckers

Hey everyone, Luckers here. Most of you will have heard of Maria (The Maria from MAFO—Maria and Find Out), who along with Alan Romanczuk work for Team Jordan in making sure the continuity of the series is maintained—essentially, they're the ones who go through the four million words of notes to supply Brandon with the information he needs to keep the series running on path.

These guys are the mechanics which keep the world running, and recently I was given a chance to get to know Maria a little better. Here is the interview; I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.

Oh, and please note that Maria refers to Robert Jordan as Jim (which is his real name—James Oliver Rigney).
