# [Interview #499: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#13)

#### Luckers

What are your plans post-WoT? Will you be involved with the potential Outrigger/Prequel Release? And what is beyond that for you?

#### Maria Simons

Even after the last book is finished, there will still be things to do. It probably won't be quite as exciting as working on a new book, but I do a lot that doesn't directly involve the book in progress. Since no decision has been made on the outriggers/prequels, I can't really say anything about them.
