# [Interview #499, Entry #6]: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#6)

#### Luckers

You said Jim didn't like to spoil you. Did this include you having access to the
notes on pre-existing issuesâ€”as in resolutions to current mysteries and plotlines? I guess the question is, how much insider information did you have along the way? And, as a fan, did it ever make you gasp (squeal, laugh, pull your braid...)?

#### Maria Simons

In the early days, Jim didn't want to spoil me. After not getting to work on
*A Crown of Swords*
, I went on a campaign to convince Jim that I didn't mind spoilers, doing things like pointing out that I frequently reread murder mysteries. I finally had some success. At some point, early on (I think 1997ish) he realized that he had multiple files with the same name in his gazillions of notes. He asked me if I would be willing to consolidate notes, given that it was quite possible that I would find spoilers. I gave him an emphatic yes, and he passed the notes to me. The first thing I did was look up Verin; it was amazingly cool to get the scoop on her. I may have squealed. And I knew who killed Asmodean pretty early on, too. Some things he did keep hidden, though. He really enjoyed pulling off surprises..
