# [Interview #499: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#9)

#### Luckers

So is Talmanes your favorite character then? If not, who is, and have they always been so or has it changed as time has passed?

#### Maria Simons

Mat is my absolute favorite. I love me some Mat. I don't know exactly when the real Mat-love started; I started liking him a lot when he took out Galad and Gawyn with his quarterstaff. I don't remember who my favorite was before that, but I did like Rand, Perrin, Lan, Verin and Moiraine (Mat was okay then, but the whole nasty dagger attitude kept him from being top tier). I didn't love Nynaeve at first, but she has really grown on me over the years. Talmanes is my favorite secondary character. Other second tier characters that I love are Siuan Sanche, Gareth Bryne, Bayle Doman, Rhuarc, Halwin Norry, Bain, Chiad, and Gaul. Okay, I better stop now. That list could get very large.

#### Luckers

Which is the character you most identify with? (Personally I'm thinking you and Verin are peas from a pod).

#### Maria Simons

I do adore sneaky sneaky Verin. I identify myself as a member of the Brown Ajah, that's for sure; I'm constantly studying books and notes. But when I'm handling all the financial stuff, I identify with Halwin Norry.
