# [Interview #499: Interview with Maria Simons by Luckers, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=499#12)

#### Luckers

Are you and Harriet working on the encylopedia now, or is that more of a 'after everything is done' kind of thing?

#### Maria Simons

Harriet, Alan, Marcia and I have all put in some work on the encyclopedia. If there's nothing else pressing, we work on it. Of course, there's no way that we can finish it before the series is finished; once
*A Memory of Light*
is done, we'll kick it into high gear.
