# [Interview #771: TOM Signing Report - Mr. Black, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=771#2)

#### Mr. Black

The Nakomi scene really jumped out at me as something that just seemed downright odd in the story. Today, I had the chance to ask Brandon about this scene at a book signing in Northern Virginia. I specifically asked him if the scene is something he plans to address in the next book.

#### Brandon Sanderson

To paraphrase, he stated that he wants to keep the specifics of what happened close to the chest for now, and that he has not decided whether he will address it in the next book.

#### Mr. Black

The fact that Brandon may leave the identity of Nakomi unanswered makes me doubt that it was either Verin or one of the Forsaken. I am much more inclined to think that it was either a result of Aviendha camping next to a Portal Stone, or a "ghostly" encounter. As I told Brandon, I hope he leaves the issue unresolved. I like the sense of mystery behind this scene. :)

I asked Brandon about the chapter with Aviendha and Nakomi. I stated that it was a very striking encounter, and it reminded me thematically of the meeting with Tom Bombadil in Lord of the Rings, i.e., something mysterious an unexplained. I asked him if he would develop the encounter any further. He stated that he did not want to discuss the character any further at the moment, because he might explore the encounter in
*A Memory of Light*
. I told him that I hope he never explains Nakomi. ;)
