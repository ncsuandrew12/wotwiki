## Entry #1

#### Eformo

I was at the Dallas signing as well. It was a large one, so the Q&A was a bit shorter than hoped for.

## Entry #2

#### Eformo

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I had the chance, I asked Brandon whether or not Lews Therin knew The Song during the Age of Legends and drew a RAFO.

## Entry #3

#### Eformo

#### Brandon Sanderson

I got a more circumspect RAFO when I asked whether or not he personally thinks of Rand as Rand after the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
, or if he now thinks of the amalgam as a different character. He thought that it would be apparent after reading the POV in both
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
.

## Entry #4

#### Eformo

A little unexpected nugget of fun was the fact that Bob Kluttz joined Brandon and Harriet on the dais. I think I caught him a little off-guard when I asked him to personalize his autograph in my book! I asked him to sign, "your personal Aelfinn," since I've gotten WAY more than three questions answered, many of which even touched on the Shadow!
