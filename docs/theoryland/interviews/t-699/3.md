# [Interview #699: Vericon Report - Puck, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=699#3)

#### Puck

I recorded the entire session and, should we get approval to post it (I could understand if Peter would rather we didn't), I'll upload it here. Until then (or instead of that, should we get a "no") here are some details that I recalled on the ride home (no cheating, Peter. I promise!)

#### Brandon Sanderson

- We deal with a bendalloy (Allomantic)/gold (Feruchemical) Twinborn in addition to Wax's steel/iron combo
  
- The nickname for a iron Feruchemist is a "Slider"
  
- A nickname for Sazed is "Harmony" (I think)

#### Footnote

The name for an Iron Feruchemist (store weight) is actually a
[Skimmer](http://coppermind.17thshard.com/wiki/Iron)
. A
[Slider](http://coppermind.17thshard.com/wiki/Bendalloy)
is an Allomantic Bendalloy burner (speed up time in bubble).
