ALLOY OF LAW READING
  
Brandon took a quick poll, and the majority wanted him to read from
*Alloy of Law*
(I voted for Steel Heart, his self-styled "superhero apocalypse book," but I wasn't too upset at the loss). Brandon took up the entire 45 minute slot reading. He read the entire prologue, summarized the events of chapter 1, and read half of chapter 2.

I'm not a professional book reviewer, and I'm clearly biased, but
*Alloy of Law*
is freaking amazing. It is able to go from touching, to exciting, to hilarious, to disturbing smoothly and believably. Seriously, it's some of the best dialogue I've seen from Brandon (and that's including Lightsong in
*Warbreaker*
).
