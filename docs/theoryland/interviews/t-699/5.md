# [Interview #699: Vericon Report - Puck, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=699#5)

#### Puck

After he signed my book, I asked him a few questions and got the following nuggets (some of these were also overheard in his discussions with other people):

#### Brandon Sanderson

**CAMEO:**
There is a cameo of Josh & Michele in Alloy of Law! There's a gunfight at their wedding reception [I feel like I've heard this somewhere before, but it also sounded new to me].
**DOUBLE TWINBORN:**
There will be a \_\_\_\_\_ Twinborn somewhere in the novel, a Twinborn with matching metals a la how the Lord Ruler used atium

#### Footnote

The Twinborn is Miles, who burns Gold.
