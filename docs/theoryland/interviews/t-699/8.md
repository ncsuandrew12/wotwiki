# [Interview #699: Vericon Report - Puck, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=699#8)

#### Puck

"How is a Splinter different from a Sliver?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Let me see... You have met splinters in
*Elantris*
,
*Warbreaker*
, and in
*Way of Kings*
. You have not met them in Mistborn."

#### PUCK

"I feel like we know that. So, qualitatively, what's the difference?"

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

"Qualitatively, they're reverses of one another. A Sliver is a human intelligence who has held the power and released it. A Splinter has never been human."

#### PUCK

"But it derives from a Shard's power."

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

"Yes. That's not it completely, but there's at least something to think about."
