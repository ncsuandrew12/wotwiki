#### OpenStone

How difficult is it to get a major publisher like TOR to publish a novel, Mr. Jordan?

#### Robert Jordan

I forgot who asked this, but it wasn't difficult to get Tor to publish my first novel. Tom Doherty liked what I write. I've been writing for 20 years and I told him that I had an idea for a multi-volume book. I didn't know how many books and probably any other publishers would have thrown me out of his office but Tom said OK!
