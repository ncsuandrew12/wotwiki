Mr. Jordan. were you rushed by publisher deadlines?

#### Robert Jordan

In a way. Not with the last book, certainly but
*The Eye of the World*
took four years to write. Each of the other books took 13 or 14 months but the publisher brought out the second book 10 months after the first and the following books at 12-month intervals. You can see there's a law of diminishing returns there. For this last book, I simply told them I could not do it again.
*A Crown of Swords*
took about 20 months to write, in fact. That's why the book didn't come out last fall or earlier in the spring.
