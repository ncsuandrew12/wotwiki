#### Anastin BW

Mr Jordan, do you have any personal thoughts about people Role Playing in the world you have given us?

#### Robert Jordan

I have a standard letter that I send to people when they ask for permission to do role-playing, in which I grant them very limited permission to do this. It says, in effect, that you have permission to do it in this instance as long as you don't try to make a profit off of it.
