The Almighty's original name was Tanavast, yes/no?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49639631238598656)

Yes and no. The concept of the "Almighty" in Roshar has a lot of meanings, many of them wrong.

But the person who held the Shard Honor was originally named Tanavast?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49647539623952384)

Yes. You wiggled it out of me. That was the name of the original holder of the Shard Honor
