#### Chaos

So Aona is a synonym for love, hmm? Is Charity the correct Shard name?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not quite. I'm trying to remember what the guesses were for the other Shard on Sel. I may have dismissed them too quickly.

#### CHAOS

How about Mercy for Aona, then? The guesses for Skai's Shard include Devotion, Obedience, and Order.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Okay, I was right, then. Ha There's something very ironic in all of this.
