#### Brandon Sanderson

Finally, perhaps the most exciting to me, is something for you
*Elantris*
readers: Amazon's exclusive rights to "Hope of Elantris" (the short story I wrote in the Elantris world) ran out yesterday.
[So I've posted it on my website for you all to read](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/32/Elantris-The-Hope-of-Elantris)
. Those of you who bought it on Amazon have my thanks; you actually pushed me to being a #1 Amazon best seller for a week or so, which was kind of cool. We wanted to offer this to Amazon because they had asked, and we figured it couldn't be bad to earn some good will. However, I always intended to put it on my website eventually.

To add something new, I've done an extended annotation of the short story. You'll find the annotation at the end; if you've already read the story, you'll probably find this annotation quite interesting.
