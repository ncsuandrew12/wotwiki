# [Interview #373, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Back from Dragon*Con with Many Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=373#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've got a lot of Updates for you below, so stay with me. I think there's something here for everyone: A WoT update, a Mistborn link, and a really cool
*Elantris*
link. So read on!

First up, for Mistborn readers,
[Pat's Fantasy Hotlist is giving away free copies of Mistborn 3](http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2008/08/win-copy-of-brandon-sandersons-hero-of.html)
. I don't know if these are ARCs or Hardcovers, but I think that he will be sending the copies to the winners once the book is out in stores.

For you WoT fans who couldn't see me at Dragon\*Con or Worldcon, my good friend
[Ookla (Peter Ahlstrom) did this excellent write up of the Wrapping Up the Wheel of Time panel from Worldcon](http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html)
. There's a lot of good information here.
