The VOICE At Tarwin's Gap (
*The Eye of the World*
)

Since the Creator cannot or will not act in creation, we can reasonably surmise that it wasn't the Creator's voice Rand heard when chasing Ishamael (I had hoped it was). So, then whose was it? The Dark One's "voice" is written in all caps in
*Lord of Chaos*
, but the
voice in
*The Eye of the World*
is caps and italics. This may just be a change in how RJ wrote the Dark One's voice, but it may signify a different speaker.
