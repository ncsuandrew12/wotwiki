#### Michael Martin

Most of this has been posted at various times, but I've been encouraged by a number of people to post them collectively, so here they go.

I attended a signing at Joseph-Beth Booksellers in Cincinnati, OH, on 10/12/96. The signing was officially for the
*Fallon*
series, but I recall only one or two
*Fallon*
books. About 35 fans showed.
