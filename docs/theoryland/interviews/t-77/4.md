#### Robert Jordan

The Two \*gars

RJ admitted outright that they were Aginor and Balthamel, and that Aginor was the male and Balthamel was the woman. I still feel that Aginor describing himself as "helping" make the Trollocs is not consistent, but hey, I didn't write the books. When I asked
him if he was confirming their IDs, RJ said (in a slightly tired tone), "I've never
*denied*
it." This was rather surprising to me, to say the least.
