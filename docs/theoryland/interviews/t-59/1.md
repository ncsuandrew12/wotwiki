# [Interview #59, Entry #1]: Letter to Austin Sirkin](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=59#1)

#### Austin Sirkin

I recently received a letter from RJ. I'm posting all of the info I think is worthwhile. Have fun!

#### Robert Jordan

I wrote "Jak o' the Shadows" to the tune of "Gary Owen," but I suppose anybody can put the words to what they wish.
