## [Entry #1](./t-171/1)

#### Zeynep Dilli

This is a good place to put in my own report, I guess. Sorry for the delay.

I was there around 11:30 for the signing that was supposed to start around 12:30. There were about 15 people in the bookstore's cafe by then; but by the time 12:30 rolled around there was a sizable line, which stayed full until the end. There were about 50 people in the line almost constantly from 12:30 to 13:30.

I situated myself behind the table and didn't get in the line; John Nowacki and his friends graciously accepted to get my books signed for their second time in the line. Thanks again.

## [Entry #2](./t-171/2)

#### Zeynep Dilli

As soon as he came in, he answered some "FAQs" in a loud voice down the line:

#### Robert Jordan

He gave the correct pronunciations for Nynaeve, Egwene, Seanchan etc.; touched the Question That Won't Die as "someone figured it out correctly using evidence prior to
*Winter's Heart*
"; said "There will be at least
*two*
more books. I hope two. I apologize for that" and repeated the usual "I knew the last scene since..."; said that the next book would be coming out as soon as possible after he finishes writing it, and laid down the ground rule for picture-taking: "Men must keep their clothes on. I never try to tell women what to do, but men must keep their clothes on."

## [Entry #3](./t-171/3)

#### Zeynep Dilli

Here's a compilation of questions asked, some of which were from RASFWR-J through me or
[John](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172)
.

How much time elapsed between the last chapter of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
and the epilogue?

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#2)
): He thought for a second before giving an RAFO and adding it was not that much, certainly not months.

#### Zeynep Dilli

What he said.

## [Entry #4](./t-171/4)

#### Question

Without the True Power to contrast it with, did people in the Age of Legends refer to the 'One Power' and 'True Source', or simply the 'Power' and the 'Source'?

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#3)
): The names would have been the same, he said, since "One Power" was meant to signify that
*saidin*
and
*saidar*
are two halves of the same thing and not different things entirely.

#### Zeynep Dilli

What he said.

## [Entry #5](./t-171/5)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#4)
): Some kid asked him something about material on the Internet, and he mentioned Wotmania, Dragonmount.com, TarValon.net, and something else. If he said anything about rasfwrj, I didn't hear it.

#### Zeynep Dilli

He didn't, and I paused and decided against mentioning the FAQ there. He mentioned tarvalon.net because the people from the site were next in line to the kid and they called out.

## [Entry #6](./t-171/6)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#5)
): Someone asked for a little more description about the
*sa'sara*
—as in how does he envision one doing it—which he thought was hilarious. He said she was the first person who'd asked him about it and apart from saying it would be like something a non-tourist might see in Cairo or Istanbul, he said it wouldn't be "boring" like a stripper act in the U.S. He seemed to really get a kick out of this question.

#### Zeynep Dilli

What he said. That was fun.

## [Entry #7](./t-171/7)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#6)
): Someone else said something about his health and got a lengthy recitation of Jordan's blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and so on.

#### Zeynep Dilli

At his last physical: cholesterol 197, his doctor not worried about his triglycerides, blood pressure 105/62, resting pulse 68, and he performed exceedingly well in the stress test. He was a little irritated at the question, I think. Can't guess why. Someone else asked if people ever sent him vitamins etc. Nope.

## [Entry #8](./t-171/8)

#### Question

Someone asked him how "knuckling [one's] forehead" was done.

#### Robert Jordan

He described it as a way of touching your cap, as it were, same with "tugging [one's] forelocks"—the way he lifted his head to demonstrate both movements, thumb down and palm slightly down and out, a person's knuckles do naturally touch the forehead. "It's how you greet(ed) a superior in military."

## [Entry #9](./t-171/9)

#### Question

Were Rand and Ishamael physically in the sky at Falme?

#### Robert Jordan

No, but they could be
*seen there*
, like a mirage. They could be seen in other places as well [other false Dragons' falls].

#### Zeynep Dilli

He didn't say
*where*
they were,
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
or some other plane. Wherever, as far as I'm concerned.

## [Entry #10](./t-171/10)

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, he's got e-mail. No, he isn't giving it out.

## [Entry #11](./t-171/11)

#### Zeynep Dilli

His favorite character?

#### Robert Jordan

First he gave the standard answer of "whoever I'm writing at the moment"; then the conversation moved to his esteem for the characters, however, and that gave interesting things away. "Lan embodies the ideal I aspired to be. Perrin...was me while I was growing up, but I also behaved a lot like Mat. Harriet says I'm like Loial."

#### Zeynep Dilli

(Slightly after that, Harriet, who'd been browsing the bookstore, came to stand beside me and we struck up a conversation. She is a wonderful lady. While on the subject of how unpleasant it is to be dragged from city to city and hotel to hotel rather than being snug in your own home, she did repeat the Loial comment about her husband, independently.)

## [Entry #12](./t-171/12)

#### Question

Someone asked what he felt about the Superbowl.

#### Robert Jordan

The answer, essentially, was "I don't care."

## [Entry #13](./t-171/13)

#### Question

[Will there be] a WoT movie?

#### Robert Jordan

"I don't know. If you know Peter Jackson or Spielberg, you can always ask them to give me a call..." No objections to a movie as long as the people coming to him with an offer have
*both*
the means and the knowledge to pull it off. That might be a tougher proposition than even
*Lord of the Rings*
, in my opinion, due to sheer length and number of characters involved.

## [Entry #14](./t-171/14)

#### Question

Ever had threats from fans?

#### Robert Jordan

Not really, but at one signing a biker gang showed up, mentioned rumors about his "failing" health, and threatened to desecrate his grave if he died before finishing the series. Heh.

## [Entry #15](./t-171/15)

#### Question

Will he do a European tour?

#### Robert Jordan

I guess his answer applies to a possible Canadian signing as well: If the publisher in $COUNTRY invites him and pays for the journey. The person who asked the question specifically inquired after Belgium. He hasn't had any leads that way from France or Belgium yet, but he mentioned a Hungarian tour is coming up since the publisher there contacted him.

On a slightly related note, and I guess I'm the one that cares most, a Turkish publisher has finally contacted him for a translation. Fantasy translation is a new thing in Turkey, although sci-fi have been translated for years—we got
*Lord of the Rings*
in Turkish only in 1998, for example—and we'll see how good the translation will turn out to be.

## [Entry #16](./t-171/16)

#### Zeynep Dilli

I asked about the Seanchan divorce ceremony, wondering if it was anything like the old Islamic ceremony—i.e., just declaring that you are divorced.

#### Robert Jordan

He answered that it's more intricate than that. He went into the details about why the marriage ceremony is as it is (as Egeanin explains it in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, nothing new), and said that the divorce required more than just declaring it.

## [Entry #17](./t-171/17)

#### Zeynep Dilli

I also asked about what sorts of music he hears in his mind's ear, as it were, while he's writing about the different musical styles in Randland.

#### Robert Jordan

For example, the Tinker music is (obviously) gypsy music, tziganes and similar. Thom chanting the tales is quite like troubadour music of the Middle Ages in continental Europe. As for others—dance music, general folk—he mentioned Irish folk music (gigs and reels, I guess, and ballads), Appalachian Hill music, and bluegrass.

#### Zeynep Dilli

I don't quite know where that last comes from, but oh well.

Overall, it was fun.
