I think that makes a lot of sense, thank you very much, your writing advice especially on writing excuses is phenomenal, it's helped me a lot.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you.

#### GOOGLE MODERATOR

I've got a question here from Alex Stevens, he was in the hangout earlier, he's Australian and he was desperate to come and he's just messaged us and he's said "Could you please ask my Warbreaker question?"
