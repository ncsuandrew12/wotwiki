#### Luke

I was wondering if you could only write in one universe from now on, what would you pick?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well you gave me an out, because so many of my books are in the same universe.

\*laughter\*

#### LUKE

You know, I thought you might say that.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

So that, I could cheat and just say the cosmere, but I think the soul of the question is which series would I write on.

I would probably have to -boy- it would probably be a toss up between Mistborn and the Stormlight archive, Mistborn because I've invested so much into it already. If I can only pick one I would probably pick Stormlight because there is so much left to tell there and I've got a lot of places to explore, but I would cheat and say they're all in the same universe.
