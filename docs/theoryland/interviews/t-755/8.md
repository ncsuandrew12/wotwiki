Hey Brandon, Although like stories and you know, plot characters, twists are all very important, for me a great story is made up of great moments and the question I wrote in the post there was about when Dalinar swaps his sword for the bridge men and asks the question 'how much is a life worth?' and for me that was a moment where I had to put the book down because it was just so great, it brought the characters together and all these reasonings all these visions it all came to a head and I was thinking how many moments like these do you think a great book needs for example I mean other things I'd seen in that book was when Kaladin, he tells his men to come out after the storm and see him alive again or in the gathering storms when Rand is on Dragonmount and everything you know, he destroys the Choedan Kal, so how many moments like that do you think they need an can you give me an example of a great book that you love from another Authors book where you think there is a great moment like those ones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, excellent, I'll start with the last one, one of my favorite books of all time is Les Miserables and it's full of moments like that and I'm going to have to pick the moment where Jean Valjean goes for Marius and brings him back through the sewers and things like that, moments like that are what makes books work for me.

What you're noticing is part of the way I design my plots, when I'm going to write a story I feel like I have to have moments like that prepared and planned that I can write towards. I will often go and turn on epic music of the right type, (whatever I'm feeling is epic at the time ) and go and walk or go on the treadmill or do something active and while doing that I will try to imagine what moments like that will be for this given book; what will be the really powerful character or plot moment that just make you, want to put the book down and sit back for a minute and say "Whoa!"

I have to be able to imagine some of those for every book I write, otherwise I can't start the book, I write my books kind of... the points on the map philosophy, meaning I have to have something to write toward for me to get there. I -It's like having a map where you say, Ok I'm going to drive from one place to another and here are the places along the way I'm going to stop. I need to know where those places are and these places are usually these powerful moments and it's how I build stories.
