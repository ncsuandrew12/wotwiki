Today we are very excited to welcome Brandon Sanderson to our shores and to a Google hangout on air. Just a brief introduction, Brandon has recently been short listed for not one but two awards for Alloy of law for Uk and David Gemmel and in the- for a Hugo as well for his weekly podcast Writing Excuses. And he's been in Australia on a mad, world wind tour visiting four cities which doesn't sound a lot to you Americans but believe me it's a big vast country here and that's a big distance so we're very excited to welcome him, thankyou Brandon for coming.
