#### Question

Getting back to
*Callandor*
, we know that you have to channel the appropriate power though a seed—
*saidin*
or
*saidar*
. So I was wondering how
*Callandor*
got True Power capability. Is it because of the flaw, or did someone channel the True Power through the seed at the time it was created?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's an excellent question to which I do not have the answer. It's not one I had considered.

#### Question

Somebody had said when I posted in the Facebook re-readers group that there is a theory that the capability might be due to the Taint, but I wasn't sure that was the case.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe it was made intentionally to do what it did for a specific use. Not what it ended up being used for. I don't think it was used for that. I think it was built—you're going to have to clear it with Maria—I think it was built to be a trap for one of the male Forsaken.
