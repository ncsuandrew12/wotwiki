# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#9)

#### Question

Did you have a method for keeping the voice of the characters the same as the previous book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did, and that method was to read the last scene of that character before I wrote the new one. That became tougher as I wrote more and more on the last three books as I went along and the characters changed. Reading Rand from Book 11 didn't help a lot with Book 14, but it did help with Book 12.
