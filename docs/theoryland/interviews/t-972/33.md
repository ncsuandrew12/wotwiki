# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#33)

#### Question

When Gawyn and Galad were defeated so handily by Demandred, I was thinking it was a throwaway of two characters. Then Lan rolls in and it put everything in perspective to show how good he was. Was that the purpose?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was part of the purpose. It was a war, and someone needed to take out Demandred. Gawyn's arc is tragic, and the end of the arc is what we all know he shouldn't do, by going out by himself.
