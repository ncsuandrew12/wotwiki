#### Question

Do you see Robert Jordan’s characters coming out in your writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. That may happen unconsciously, but my goal is not to have that happen, because I want to tell different stories. It would be like if Kelsier started coming out in Dalinar. It's just not something we want to have happen as a writer. We want everyone to be their own individual.
