# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#31)

#### Question

Did the Ogier come from the same world as the
*grolm*
and other Seanchan creatures?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not believe that they did.

#### Question

But did they come from a different world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[laughs] Hey, hey, That I will RAFO!

#### Footnote

[Maria confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#5)
that Ogier are from a Parallel World. On the other hand,
[RJ apparently indicated](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#57)
the Seanchan exotics such as
*grolm*
were brought back from Mirror Worlds via the Portal Stones.
