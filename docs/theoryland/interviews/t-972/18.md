# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#18)

#### Question

Was it up to you to decide what the Dark One actually was? The revelation that the Dark One was a concept or idea rather than a person reminded me very much of Ruin from the
*The Hero of Ages*
. How did you make that decision?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was left a lot of freedom on how to do that specific thing, and earlier in the first draft he wasn't so much like that. We felt the conflict wasn't working—it felt more like the Last Conversation than the Last Battle. Harriet sent back direction for something stronger. The revision included the dueling of possibilities. That is where the Dark One became more involved and so it evolved into that, but we weren't following anything specific Jim had said.
