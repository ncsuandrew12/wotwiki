#### Question

Is there any method to keep the universes separate in your mind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

People often ask questions like this. It's a hard question to answer because I'm very absent mindedâ€”I forget my keys or where I parked my car. But I don't forget stories. I have stories from when I was 15 still crystal clear in my mind, waiting to be written down. That's just how I work. I do have tools to help me work. One of them is a personal Wiki, it's open source, and called WikiDPad. I really like that. It's helpful visually. But at the end of the day, I've just got to get the stories down on the page without screwing them up.
