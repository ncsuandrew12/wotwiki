# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#32)

#### Question

The [offscreen] conversation between Tuon and Hawkwing, can you tell us anything about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can tell you that it did take place, and that Hawkwing is more inclined to agree with what's going on in Seanchan than I think what fans expect him to be. Now, remember that Hawking was not fond of Aes Sedai. Part of that was not his fault, but he was not fond of them. He is not just King Arthur, he is Alexander the Great. King Arthur ruled through justice. Artur Hawkwing ruled through justice and ruthlessness. It will certainly be a conversation filled with emotion and passion, but I don't think everyone expecting Hawkwing to take their side is understanding who Artur Hawkwing is.
