#### Question

Perrin felt his
*ta'veren*
-ness melting away. If Mat lost it too, does he lose his luck?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't believe that he does. Being a
*ta'veren*
has a distinct effect on him, but I think there is an innate luckiness to Mat, partially drawn from the fact that the Heroes [of the Horn] call him Gambler. And so in other lives where he would not have been
*ta'veren*
he was still a gambler and still lucky. However, I do think being a
*ta'veren*
meant that the luck was greatly magnified, and I think it grew stronger and stronger through the series. That's my read on it from the notes, and I'm pretty sure on that one. I have to give the caveat that there could be something out there that contradicts me.
