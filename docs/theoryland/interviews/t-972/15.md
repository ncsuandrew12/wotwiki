After this initial Q&A session, Brandon and Harriet went straight back to the signing table.

The signing went until 11:30. All kinds of books came through the line, including Brandon's Alcatraz books, a few

Below are some interesting questions fans posed to Brandon and Harriet. They include major spoilers for WoT and Mistborn! You have been warned.
