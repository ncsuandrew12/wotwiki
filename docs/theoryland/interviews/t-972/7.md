#### Question

Are any of [the outrigger books] going to happen?

#### Harriet McDougal

No. I'm sorry about that, but as you all may know, Jordan expressed his horror of anyone writing in his universe. He said he would rent a semi and drive it back and forth over his hard disks before that happened. He made it clear in the last months that he did want them finished. But as for the outrigger novels, he only left one or two sentences, and there isn't enough of Robert Jordan for him to be present in those books in the way he would have wanted. The same with the prequels. I'm sure youâ€™ve all seen
*A Christmas Carol*
and Marley shows up all in clanking chains? He'd come and get me!
