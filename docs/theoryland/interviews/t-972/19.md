#### Question

In your novellas
*Legion*
and
*The Emperor's Soul*
, there was a common theme of a creation of character. Were you making a comment on that as a writer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Emperor's Soul*
was much more so, specifically dealing with the artistic process. That was part of the theme for me.
*Legion*
was more "Wow, this idea's awesome." I originally told Dan (from Writing Excuses) that he should write this, it's really quirky. He said, "I got my own ideasâ€”go write it yourself!"
