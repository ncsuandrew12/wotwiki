# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#22)

#### Question

Was Perrin's hammer forged with Hopper's soul, or was he considered dead at the time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There was nothing in the notes to say I could put Hopper's soul in the hammer, but there was also nothing to say I couldn't, so I believe it was there, since otherwise it would be gone forever. [Much cheering from the Memory Keepers]
