#### JaimieKrycho

Hello WoT fans!

Memory Keeper Bill Tracy, aka Mandamon, here (via Jaimie Sedai), reporting on the third-to-last signing for
*A Memory of Light*
that took place in Raleigh, North Carolina, on February 20th. We were lucky to have both Brandon and Harriet with us.

We convened at
[Quail Ridge Books and Music](http://www.quailridgebooks.com/store-info)
, a fantastic independent bookstore that has been serving the Raleigh community for nearly thirty years, and is well known to locals and students at the nearby North Carolina State University. Quail Ridge Books is unique in that it acts as a meeting place for writers of all ages—both new and seasoned. They have a large space available for books signings, and it was certainly needed this night!

The lucky fans Chosen (pun fully intended) by Dragonmount for this event were Gary Singer (our "First Among Equals"), Gary Kellum, Kerri Cushing, Tom Burchhardt, Jaimie Krycho, Oliver Gatchalian, Joel Abney, and myself. Seven of us met twice before the signing to go over the schedule, test our recording equipment, and generally nerd out, and the eighth joined us at the signing itself, as he had to make a two-hour drive. We instantly bonded and had a lot of fun discussing both WoT and Brandon's own works.

Before the signing, the Memory Keepers all arrived several hours early, but some fans still had us beat! We saved our front-row seats, flapped books, set up the event area, and giggled delightedly about what would happen that night.

Brandon and Harriet's flight got in a little late, but they were right on the ball, sitting down to sign several hundred pre-ordered and first edition books, as well as the Memory Keepers' books, all while answering questions. It takes quite the multitasking skills to write a quote in a copy of
*A Memory of Light*
while answering hard questions posed by avid fans! Many of the fans' question are included at the end of this post, but everything up to then will remain spoiler-free.

We were only able to blast questions at the two for about thirty minutes before we had to reluctantly give them up to the hundreds of other fans waiting in the store, who clapped and cheered as Brandon and Harriet entered the room.

Oliver initiated the live stream for Dragonmount as René, event coordinator at Quail Ridge, laid the ground rules for the signing. Tom then introduced Brandon and Harriet with a moving speech about the influence that WoT has had on its readers.
