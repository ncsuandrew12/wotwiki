#### Brandon Sanderson

That's when he was doing his rebuild. He didn't really have to, but he let himself. He has to recharge periodically, and then stays on a higher and higher burn over the thousand years. It gets harder and harder. The way the magic worksâ€”he doesn't have to stay aged.

#### Question

Is he burning or tapping?

#### Brandon Sanderson
