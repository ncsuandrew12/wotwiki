# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#29)

#### Question

Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to read
*White Sand*
and
*Aether of the Night*
and I enjoyed them very much. Will they ever be published? I also managed to read
*Dragonsteel*
and I enjoyed that too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

*White Sand*
will definitely eventually be published.
*Aether of The Night*
, not so sure on, because
*Aether*
is two halves of two books that didn't fit together. The two pieces didn't mesh.
*White Sand*
is part of the sequence and will be done.
*Dragonsteel*
is part of the sequence and will be done, but it will be very different now that the Shattered Plains have been used in
*Way of Kings*
.
