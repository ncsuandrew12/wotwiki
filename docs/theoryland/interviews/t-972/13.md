# [Interview #972: AMOL Signing Report - JaimieKrycho, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=972#13)

#### Question

I was amazed by the language, geography, people, and so on in the books, and I always wondered what Robert Jordan's office looked like. I thought it must be covered with maps and things relating to the books. What was it like to walk in there?

#### Harriet McDougal

What you saw first when you walked in was a plastic human skeleton. And it wears a Viking helmet. And then you saw the books. There was a bookcase filled with books on religions. There was another bookcase of Westerns. There was a very big printer, and a roll-top desk. But what there weren't were maps. They were all in his head.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There were a lot of weapons, though.

#### Harriet McDougal

There was a room full of edged weapons!
