# [Interview #577: Utopiales Convention, Nantes, France: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=577#13)

#### Question

Which are your last top choice readings? By the way, do you still have the time to read?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do have the time to read occasionally. I think it's important to read. I think it's extremely important for me to read in the fantasy genre, and be aware of what other authors are doing, because there are lot of them who are way better than I am and I want to be able to learn from them.

My top choice to go to these days is Terry Pratchett; I love his work. And recently I've been very impressedâ€”though of course it's been a year or two since I read it, but
*The Name of the Wind*
by Patrick Rothfuss is absolutely brilliant. And sitting on my desk to be read next is a book called
*Shades of Milk and Honey*
, by Mary Robinette Kowal, that I've been wanting to read for a long time, and I have a copy I just picked up at Tor offices. My wife is reading it right now. So I'll wait until she's done and maybe read it on the plane.
