# [Interview #577: Utopiales Convention, Nantes, France: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=577#1)

#### Question

How have you liked your stay in France so far? Do you enjoy contact with your French fans? What are the differences with the ComicCon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes! My wife and I were speaking about it just recently. The fans here at the convention seem more distinguished, actuallyâ€”it's very interesting, we were commenting on it. At ComicCon, which I enjoy, there's almost more a feel that it's a big zoo or a party, with lots of extravagant costumes, and lots of people going just to be seen. The fans here seem very serious about the science fiction and fantasy. They go to the panels and they listen; they ask very intelligent questions. So I'm very impressed.
