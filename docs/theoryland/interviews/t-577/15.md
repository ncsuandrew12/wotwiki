#### Question

And as a conclusion: do you have a few words to say to your French readers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yes, I very much appreciate my French readers and my French publisher, who's wonderful. I appreciate you guys, and thank you for reading my books and for welcoming me to France. I've actually really liked it here. I studied French in high school for four years, but I'm terrible at it. But yes, thank you very much! And thank you so much for the award.
