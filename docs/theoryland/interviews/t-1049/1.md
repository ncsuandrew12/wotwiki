# [Interview #1049, Entry #1]: WOR Signing Report - Kurkistan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1049#1)

#### Kurkistan

Just got back from the signing. It was a ton of fun, met a bunch of Sharders and it's really cool to see Brandon speak in person and to actually talk to him. He really is an awesome guy. :D

Anyway, you guys don't want all this mushy stuff: Let's get to the questions! ;)

#### Footnote

Kurkistan's first question was part of a longer conversation
