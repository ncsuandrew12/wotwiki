# [Interview #1049: WOR Signing Report - Kurkistan, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1049#6)

#### Kurkistan

Last question: If Wayne was inside of a speed bubble and punches somebody who's standing outside it, what's happening with his fist and them: are they like sucked into the bubble, or what?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, I have... So
*exiting*
a speed bubble, while it's going, has
*weird*
ramifications on lots of things. It would be really hard to punch somebody through a speed bubble—

#### Kurkistan

So would the surface like distend around his fist——< Illustrates with fist "stretching out" invisible film >

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's going to steal your momentum, but if you actually managed to do it, then—yes. Anything in the speed bubble that's touching through is counted as being as part of the speed bubble.

#### Kurkistan

Okay, so the bubble would end here < Draws invisible surface in the air > and his fist would be out there < Illustrates by "punching" arm through the fake surface, demonstrating the fist extending past the bubble while he arm is within >, but still fast?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Kurkistan

Oh okay, thank you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's how I would imagine it so far.

#### Kurkistan

But the bubble does
*end*
at [the same place still, with the fist extending out past its boundary].

#### Brandon Sanderson

The bubble does end, yes.

#### Kurkistan

—[EDIT: Cleaned up last question based on better recording. Thanks :) ]

#### Brandon Sanderson

And when you're punching through, it's going to—your momentum is gonna'—you're going to lose momentum and get a ricochet, because you're lurching from—< notices Kurkistan (very foolishly) acting like he's about to leave > anyway... I'll let you figure that one out on your own.
