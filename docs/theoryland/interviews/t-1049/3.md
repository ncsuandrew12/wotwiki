# [Interview #1049: WOR Signing Report - Kurkistan, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1049#3)

#### Kurkistan

What would happen if you shot a Thug with an aluminum bullet or stabbed him with an aluminum knife?—[Note: Brandon initially misunderstands the question, as you shall see.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah, that's a good question. And, um.. the wound would not be able to heal
*around*
the aluminum, but once the aluminum came out, and was gone from the system, they would be okay.

#### Kurkistan

Wait, is that a Bloodmaker, not a Thug?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, you're talking about Thu— Oh, okay. Yeah, ummm... It would work similarly, but it really wouldn't really have a huge effect on them.

#### Kurkistan

Ah, okay. 'Cause Peter was implying that there was some weird aluminum interaction with Thugs.

#### Brandon Sanderson

What was he thinking of... There is some weird interaction but—

#### Kurkistan

< rudely interrrupts > In the wedding scene [in
*Alloy of Law*
] Wax thinks that they would have aluminum bullets to deal with Thugs and I was like "oh that's a typo" and Peter was like "oh no it's not..."

#### Brandon Sanderson

No no... That would just be—it's like I said: healing it until the bullet is gone. It's just the same as the Bloodmaker.

#### Kurkistan

< Various pleasantries from me apologizing for all the confusion >
