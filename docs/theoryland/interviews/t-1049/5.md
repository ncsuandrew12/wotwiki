# [Interview #1049: WOR Signing Report - Kurkistan, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1049#5)

#### Kurkistan

Are flamespren, are they all doing their own thing, or is there some Ideal of "Fire" sitting in the Spiritual Realm that they're all based on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Each spren is based on the Ideal of Fire.

#### Kurkistan

And is that sitting in the Spiritual Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, we're using sort of a Platonic Ideal, and that concept is in force, so < sounds hesitant > "yes", but [spren] are manifestations of it.

#### Kurkistan

So these Ideals in the Spiritual Realm: Divine Breath, does that heal by accessing some Ideal of Human Health: so a guy who had never had a tongue and doesn't know how to speak all the sudden has a tongue and can speak? [Note: Talking of Susebron here]

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are... < LONG pause > You are, um, on the right track.

#### Kurkistan

Okay...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because the Breath is... eh. How can I explain this? You are, yeah... So... So each Breath is a shade of deity, right?

#### Kurkistan

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And each Breath incorporates into it this sort of idea of being endowed by the deity Endowment, correct?

#### Kurkistan

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And so each Breath you hold brings you one step closer to becoming like that, and so what you're saying is... is "yes", kind of true, yes.

#### Kurkistan

But it's like within the Breath, not sitting off by itselfâ€”

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, yes yes exactly.
