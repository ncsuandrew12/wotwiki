# [Interview #925: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Stormlight 2 Writing Video, Hugo Nomination Deadline, DANGEROUS WOMEN & Updates, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=925#6)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm starting a new weekly bonus content feature for the next few months as a bit of an experiment. Right now I'm writing the sequel to
*The Way of Kings*
, and I've recorded my writing process for one chapter using
[Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html)
(which was provided to me by the folks at TechSmith). The chapter I've recorded is the new interlude featuring Rysn (who was in one of the interludes in the first book). I've split the recording up into multiple videos that I'm uploading to
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxFySrqdi8E&hd=1)
. The first one is up now, and it covers the prewriting/outlining for the chapter. For now, the videos are in real time, but once they're all uploaded I'll make a high-speed version of the whole chapter for those of you who don't want to sit and watch my normal typing speed.

Some of you are wondering if this video will have spoilers for Stormlight 2. As an interlude, it takes place away from most of the action of the rest of the book, so you shouldn't see more than hints. This first video has the interlude's outline in it, so it will partially spoil the rest of the videos, but you'll find that the outline is very sparse. It's probably more likely to make you more interested to read more than to spoil you for the rest.

The main point of these videos is to show you my writing process, which is something I get a lot of questions about. Enjoy. Stormlight 2 should come out before Christmas if I can get the first draft finished in April. I'm working hard on it right now, so we'll see if that happens.
