#### Brandon Sanderson

As many of you know, I adapted a large number of readers' names for use in
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
. Linda over at the 13th Depository has
[an article that lists all of the names](http://13depository.blogspot.com.au/2002/02/character-names-derived-from-readers.html)
that were chosen for characters and how they were adapted into the books, including some character names adapted by Robert Jordan in previous books. Note that I also adapted some people's names as place names and other non-character names, and the list doesn't include those. There will probably be another list later.

Last Wednesday I did a Tor chat on Twitter. All of the questions I answered (the questions and my answers include a lot of spoilers, especially for
*A Memory of Light*
, so be warned!) are now up in these two Twitter post archives:
