# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#4)

#### Rob B

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Another humorous anecdote involved the many, many, many files Robert Jordan kept regarding The Wheel of Time. Brandon was determined to get a word count of all the notes so he assembled all the word documents into one file. If I recall correctly, Brandon mentioned the page count was at 32,000 pages in his final document when he clicked the word count button. Word stopped at (IIRC) 5 million words and it wasn't done counting. Word and his PC summarily crashed.
