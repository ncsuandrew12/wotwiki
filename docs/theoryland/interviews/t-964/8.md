# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#8)

#### Rob B

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

When asked why Brandon didn't write the second Stormlight novel between
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
he indicated writing
*The Way of Kings*
simultaneously with The Wheel of Time nearly drove him crazy.

#### Rob B

(Personal note, it is amazing that he produced two quality novels under that type of pressure.)
