# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#16)

#### Rob B

After all the other folks had their books signed it was down to the library staff, Brandon, Harriet, Brandonâ€™s agent Joshua and the seven Memory Keepers. Brandon graciously signed what we brought including my paperback copy of
*The Way of Kings*
which quotes my
[SFFWorld review](http://www.sffworld.com/brevoff/654.html)
and calls out my name (!!!). I also had my hardcover copies of
*Mistborn: The Hero of Ages*
,
*A Memory of Light*
, and
*Towers of Midnight*
signed as well as
*The Alloy of Law*
signed for one of my wife's colleagues and paperbacks of
*Mistborn: The Well of Ascension*
and
*Mistborn: The Hero of Ages*
signed for a friend who was unable to attend.

So, a long night, but one of the best nights I've had as a fan and a reader. It was a blast meeting and chatting with Harriet and Brandon and great to get to know some other Wheel of Time fans in real life.
