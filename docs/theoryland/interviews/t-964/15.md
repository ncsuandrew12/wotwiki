# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#15)

#### Rob B

#### Harriet McDougal (paraphrased)

I spoke to Harriet about the covers in the series, remarking how she indicated when she saw Whelan's cover for
*A Memory of Light*
she said
["that is the Rand I have waited to see for twenty years"](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/michael-whelans-cover-for-a-memory-of-light-revealed)
. Harriet then said how Whelan's art, though his own style, she felt, was able to mesh with the sensibilities Sweet had always brought to his covers, in particular the landscapes. I asked her what her favorites of the covers were she immediately said
*The Eye of the World*
as a classic, she thought another moment and said she liked
*The Shadow Rising*
.
