# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#12)

#### Rob B

Questions were asked about the difference between editing Jordan and editing Brandon.

#### Harriet McDougal (paraphrased)

Harriet responded that it worked well and Brandon's insightful answer was that it was not as problematic as one might think. Specifically, Harriet knows more about the characters and world of The Wheel of Time than anybody in the world, so Brandon felt that freed him up a bit in order to flow through the story more easily.
