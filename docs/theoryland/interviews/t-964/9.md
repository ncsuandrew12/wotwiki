# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#9)

#### Rob B

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Brandon also indicated that he felt selfish about asking if he could create a new character or work with a character which was mostly his own creation for the books. Harriet immediately shushed him for hinting that he was selfish for thinking such a thing, then Brandon continued to tell of the creation of Androl, which allowed him to play with the magic in ways he'd hoped (fannishly) to explore (i.e. Portals). Harriet also provided Brandon with a folder about how leathermaking works in Randland which was perfectly timed to provide Androl with more depth as a character.
