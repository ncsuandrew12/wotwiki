# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#7)

#### Rob B

#### Harriet McDougal

When a fan asked about the Outrigger novels and Prequels, Harriet answered "No." After a moment of silence, she recounted that while Jim very much wanted the mainline Wheel of Time series to be finished, he didn't want anybody making up things in his sandbox. Jordan's extensive notes, dictated and written, were the framework for the final three novels while three sentences at most constitute the Outrigger and prequel novels.
