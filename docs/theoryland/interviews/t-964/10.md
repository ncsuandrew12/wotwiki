# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#10)

#### Rob B

The Encyclopedia came up in the discussion as potentially publishing next year.

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet indicated that this "wouldn't be just another version of the Big White Book." It would be an encyclopedia in the truest sense of the word and would likely include some of Jordan's vast stores of notes. Once the manuscript is finished, it will go off to Tor and illustrating will begin. Unlike the rushed illustrations (to be kind) in the Big White Book, more time will be allowed for the illustrations. No illustrator name was given, so it wasn't clear if they had one under contract already, if they would have only one illustrator for the entire volume, or if multiple illustrators would be commissioned. Personally, I can see both sides, having one artist's vision for things in Randland versus the chance to see a lot of artists take on things in Randland.
