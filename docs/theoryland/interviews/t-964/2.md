# [Interview #964: AMOL Signing Report - Rob B, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=964#2)

#### Rob B

Brandon and Harriet arrived after their dinner with the library staff to rousing applause.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Brandon apologized for his voice because he'd be sucking on cough drops because, well, he's been touring. He recounted the story of his introduction to The Wheel of Time and fantasy in general.

[re-released by Open Road Media in eBook](http://www.amazon.com/Dragonsbane-The-Winterlands-ebook/dp/B004TC149G/ref=sr_1_1_title_1_kin?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1361463751&sr=1-1&keywords=dragonsbane)

*The Eye of the World*
at his local comic/book/Magic store and was happy to finally have a series that was 'his' to share with his friends who were always sharing 'their' series with him. When Brandon mentioned submitting his novels for publication, the one novel he submitted directly to Tor rather than through his agent was the first published novel
*Elantris*
. Brandon recounted how he didn't let Joshua do his job and negotiate because he wanted to be published by Tor, specifically because they published The Wheel of Time. In 2005
*Elantris*
was published.
