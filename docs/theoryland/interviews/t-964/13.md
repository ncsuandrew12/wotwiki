#### Rob B

After the Q&A/Discussion concluded, everybody headed upstairs to the main foyer of the library for the signing.

Whoo boy.

The line wended its way down a hall, around bookcases and finally outside of the library and around the side of the building. I believe approximately 400 people were on line at one point, with many of them holding onto their minimum 3 items. Brandon would sign only the final three Wheel of Time novels (and none of the ones he didn't co-author), any of his own novels, and whatever assorted Wheel of Time miscellany (such as the poster one of the Memory Keepers brought). Harriet would sign and Wheel of Time novel or memorabilia and
*Ender's Game*
which she edited. I did not know she edited that novel.

My role at this point was to take pictures of people with Brandon and/or Harriet on the fan's own cameras/devices. Phil was handling overall photo events, and Bob was handling the video. SaraJane sat between Brandon and Harriet preparing the books for Harriet after Brandon's signature. Drew, Paul, and Ash helped to entertain the crowd/line with Wheel of Time trivia which resulted in people walking away with messenger bags and/or iPhone cases emblazoned with the WOT logo, author's names and
*A Memory of Light*
. Paul also snapped a couple of photos with fans for the fans as the line was moving along.
