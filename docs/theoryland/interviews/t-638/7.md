# [Interview #638: Alloy of Law Signing Report - ValMar, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=638#7)

#### Question

The discussion about Rand and Lews Therin in his head has been framed as either a) Lews Therin is a construct created by Rand; b) Lews Therin is a real, separate person taking residence in Rand's head. Is the answer really limited to one of those two alternatives?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, since there will be plenty of Rand's points of view in
*A Memory of Light*
.
