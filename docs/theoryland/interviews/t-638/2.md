#### Question

Has Brandon (and Team Jordan I think) done any research on the battles/armies etc.?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, a lot. Brandon didn't want to give me specific examples to avoid spoilers for those who can guess. They contacted one very well known author who helped them with this research. Anyone can guess? I'll give one easy clue: Boromir.
