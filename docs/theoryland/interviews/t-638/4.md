#### Question

Anything final on the prequels/sequels? This was answered to a guy right before me (with the unlikely mum:)).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really. Brandon doesn't want there to be any of these, but if written he wants to be the one who writes them. Instead, he is suggesting they do a movie on Tam.
