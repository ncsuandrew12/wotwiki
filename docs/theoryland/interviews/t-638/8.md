#### Question

Is Nakomi Jenn Aiel? Was Aviendha transported through a Portal Stone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More careful thinking from Brandon. Then he said that Wetlander is a wise woman and is sniffing under the right tree. Interesting.

#### Footnote

Brandon later
[strongly implied](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=725#15)
there was no Portal Stone involved.
