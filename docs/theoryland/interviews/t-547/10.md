# [Interview #547: Grasping for the Wind Interview: Brandon Sanderson on Towers of Midnight, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=547#10)

#### John Ottinger

The title's allusion in
*The Gathering Storm*
was fairly self-evident. To what does the title of
*Towers of Midnight*
refer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Like many of Robert Jordan's titles, there is a metaphorical element and a concrete element. The title refers to both metaphorical events and an actual place. You'll have to read the book to find out.
