# [Interview #547: Grasping for the Wind Interview: Brandon Sanderson on Towers of Midnight, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=547#3)

#### John Ottinger

After releasing
*The Gathering Storm*
and getting reader responses, did you change anything about your approach to writing
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mat was the main thing that I spent a lot of extra time on post-reviews. With most everything else, I kept doing what I had already been doing. The tricky part with
*Towers of Midnight*
is that it was already going to feel like a very different book from
*The Gathering Storm*
. So taking what people said about
*The Gathering Storm*
and applying it to
*Towers of Midnight*
could be dangerous because of the different tone and feel to the plot cycles of the books. So I had to write it as the best book I felt it could be, though the one main area that I took a second look at was Mat.
