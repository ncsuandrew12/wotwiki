Anything else on your mind you would like to say to potential readers of
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A few early reviewers have noticed that there is a spoiler in the glossary. There are always little spoilers in the glossary, so that's nothing new. But in this case, it's really best not to read the glossary until you've finished the book.

I hope readers enjoy the book. Check out the sample chapters—
[Chapter One is available on Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/10/towers-of-midnight-chapter-1-qapples-firstq#more)
and
[Chapter Eight is available on my website](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/65/Towers-of-Midnight-Chapter-Eight)
.
