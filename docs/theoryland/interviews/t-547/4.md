# [Interview #547: Grasping for the Wind Interview: Brandon Sanderson on Towers of Midnight, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=547#4)

#### John Ottinger

In
*Towers of Midnight*
, does Rand become more likable? In
*The Gathering Storm*
Rand sometimes comes across as a very powerful, petulant child. Does the nobly heroic Rand of
*The Eye of The World*
and
*The Great Hunt*
ever return?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Read and find out. That's all I can say on that one.

#### John Ottinger

Editor's Note: Read "Apples First", Chapter One of
*Towers of Midnight*
at Tor.com. It's a good foreshadowing of the answer. (At the time I asked the question, Chapter One was not available to read yet.)
