# [Interview #547: Grasping for the Wind Interview: Brandon Sanderson on Towers of Midnight, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=547#2)

#### John Ottinger

Let's address the elephant in the room first. Will Mat's character and storyline play a larger role in
*Towers of Midnight*
? Have you addressed reviewer's concerns about your interpretation of Mat Cauthon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mat will play a much larger role. For one thing, a lot of the material that Robert Jordan left for Mat takes place in this book rather than in
*The Gathering Storm*
. But I did take a long look at Mat. Whether I've addressed readers' concerns about him is something I will leave up to the readers to decide. I've posted the book's first chapter from Mat's point of view on my website.
[Read that chapter](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/65/Towers-of-Midnight-Chapter-Eight)
and decide for yourself.
