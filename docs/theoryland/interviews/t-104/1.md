# [Interview #104: TPOD Signing Report - Rachel K. Warren, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=104#1)

#### Rachel K. Warren

Because I didn't bring my list of questions and I was really nervous, I asked the only question I could think of offhand: Would Birgitte know English?

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan said something to the fact that she would if she remembered it. I guess Birgitte is a really old soul. :-)
