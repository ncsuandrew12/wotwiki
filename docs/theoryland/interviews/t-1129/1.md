# [Interview #1129: Salt Lake City Fan Experience, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1129#1)

#### Question

You've mentioned several times that traveling to Shadesmar on Sel is incredibly dangerous. Would reassembling Devotion and Dominion solve this problem? Also, what about the three individuals we know to have traveled to and from Sel? Did they use the Shadesmar anyway, or have they accessed an alternate method of worldhopping?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I suppose that could work, yes. For the second question, I'm going to have to answer that with a yes as well.
