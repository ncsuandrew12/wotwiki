#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Ketchup does not exist in the Final Empire, since it is from a fruit, which are flowering plants. The Lord Ruler did not engineer fruit. Mostly people eat vegetables and roots.

#### Footnote

Oddly, there are references to fruit in Mistborn: The Final Empire. It is not known if this is merely a case of early-installment weirdness, or something else.
