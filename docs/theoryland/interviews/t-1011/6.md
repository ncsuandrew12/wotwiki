#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

I don't remember what prompted me to write this, or what impression I had that made me write this, but I wrote:
**Anyone can take up a Shard.**
No ifs, ands, or buts about it. I would not have written this if it was not crystal clear to me that this is what Brandon meant.
