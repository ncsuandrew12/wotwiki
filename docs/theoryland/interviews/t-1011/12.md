# [Interview #1011: A "Late-Breaking" Report, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1011#12)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

We asked if it was possible to use bronze to Seek Feruchemy. He said it could be possible. If it were to happen, it was very hard, because the Inquisitors would desperately like to be able to find Feruchemists that way, and it was implied they had not discovered this power. So, it is a freaking hard technique to learn, if possible at all.
