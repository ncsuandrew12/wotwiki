# [Interview #1011: A "Late-Breaking" Report, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1011#4)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Sazed's two Shards do not "cancel out", as Brandon said that it would like being pulled by two huge gravitational tides. You can get to a way that you aren't instantly ripped apart, but that doesn't mean you don't feel it. EDIT: When asked what effect the Shards would have on Sazed, Brandon said, "Read Alloy of Law to find out".
