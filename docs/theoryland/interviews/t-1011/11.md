# [Interview #1011: A "Late-Breaking" Report, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1011#11)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

I continued to ask about the Lord Ruler and his Allomantic strength. There's an upper bound to the amount of power you can get from being a savant. Brandon said that, obviously, the Lord Ruler wasn't using duralumin and Elend could only get that powerful in Soothing using duralumin. He implied that there was a way to Compound to enhance Allomancy. (Note, we have discussed this on the forums a while back. This isn't news.)
