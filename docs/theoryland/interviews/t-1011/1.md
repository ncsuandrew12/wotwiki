# [Interview #1011: A "Late-Breaking" Report, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1011#1)

#### Chaos

You know how sometimes, news stations will say "late-breaking" to say that a story is happening right at that moment?

This is not one of those.

Needless to say this is a very late report of, let's say, "an event". I got the opportunity to ask Brandon some questions, so I did. I wasn't able to transcribe Brandon's exact answers, but the second I could, I wrote the notes of the facts that I learned. Some of these answers are things you guys have learned since then.

So this is the transcription of the notes that I made after this event, along with my comments trying to remember why the crap I wrote the crap that I did. Here goes.
