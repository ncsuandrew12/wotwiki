## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1090#1)

#### Lady Radagu

Were there Cadmium/Bendalloy and possibly Chromium/Nicrosil mistings in the Final Empire? If yes, were the mists Snapping those too?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Um, yes, there were, but since the mists were trying to create a pattern to be a sign, and people didn't know all the metals, they [the mists] had to use substitutions. They were acting the way we've seen other cognitive shadows, who are deceased, act.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1090#2)

#### Lady Radagu

Since Horneaters don't really go for Vorin dresses, what would your average Horneater guy and girl wear? Anything special to differentiate a Nuatoma and their retinue?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

I'm going to have to RAFO that. We're actually working on the sketches for those, and until they're finalized, I don't want to say anything to canonize them. But we will get you that information.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1090#3)

#### Lady Radagu

How do Shallan's memory blinks work? When she takes a memory, is it of what she sees in the instant before her eyes close, or is it while they're closed?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It is what she sees right as they're closing.
