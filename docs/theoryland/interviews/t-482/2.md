# [Interview #482, Entry #2]: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#2)

#### Matt Hatch

I’m going to ask you a lot of questions about the Dark One and the Creator...

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are going to get a lot of RAFOs on this, because Robert Jordan often stayed away from, and in the notes I get the sense, the direction to stay away from questions that couldn’t be answered from someone in the world. Does that make sense? When he would like to answer the question, somebody knew that, even if they were dead, somebody in world knew the answer. When you would ask him questions nobody knows the answers to except the Dark One or the Creator themselves, he did not answer very often and that is why you don’t know very much.

#### MATT HATCH

Ok, that is absolutely fair, so you probably will RAFO, I would say, 90% of these...

#### MATT HATCH

Did the Creator or does the Creator use the One Power to create?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

RAFO.
