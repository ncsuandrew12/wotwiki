# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#20)

#### Matt Hatch

There was some
[confusion](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#14)
about Rand and the Dark One’s permission, so for clarification’s sake, did Rand have the Dark One’s permission to use the True Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not answered that. If anyone says that I have, I have not. What I have said specifically is, this is recording: generally one must have the Dark One’s permission to use the True Power. Semirhage believed that the Dark One had betrayed her by letting Rand use it. [...] It is good that you have asked this so I can make sure on the record that is the answer I have given.
