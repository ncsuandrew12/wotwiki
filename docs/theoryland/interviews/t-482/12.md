# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#12)

#### Matt Hatch

Ok. You mentioned that Mordeth was a man that had "power". You are reported as saying that his power was that "which he got by seeking out all of the evil things that weren’t related to the Shadow"...

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was seeking things that were related to the Shadow. I think that that might be a misquote. He was looking into the power of the Shadow in order to defeat it, was his goal. He was looking into everything. He was looking into things that were not necessarily related to the Dark One as well. He was looking for everything that he could get...

#### Matt Hatch

..previous to him arriving to Aridhol?

#### Brandon Sanderson

...Yeah...

#### Matt Hatch

...before he went to the King and became the counselor, Mordeth was this guy that went around searching for Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, he wanted to defeat the Dark One and he felt that he could find other ways to do it [...] He originally was good. He did not...he wasn’t this terrible person to begin with but he was looking to defeat the Dark One, to find a way to defeat the Shadow. And he looked into a lot of things he shouldn’t have looked into. There are evils that are not necessarily directly related to the Dark One, though everything evil kind of has...just as there are goods that are not related necessarily to the One Power...we are talking much as Perrin runs with wolves. This is a thing older than...there are other evils things that are old in a similar way...

#### Matt Hatch

...is the assumption then that he found one of these?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He did.

#### Matt Hatch

He found one or multiple?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He found many things of darkness. There is one in specific that is driving him but he knew too much. He found things he should not have gotten into and that is what turned him into...when he got there he was already corrupt. He still thought he was doing a good work. He still thought we are going to raise this Kingdom up and it is going to become this bastion against the Shadow, but he was already by then corrupted.

#### Matt Hatch

Is this same corrupting influence what corrupts everyone through the dagger itself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Through him, yes. And even through his presence.

#### MATT HATCH

[Hah—Maybe I should have asked if Mordeth was under the influence of the Finns...or at the very least if they were one of the powers he found in his quest... ]
