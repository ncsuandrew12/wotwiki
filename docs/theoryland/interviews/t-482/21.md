# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#21)

#### Matt Hatch

That's all we had time for (and I think I may have detected a sign of relief as we arrived in San Jose), although to those of you that sent in questions I did my best to have others during the San Jose Q&A ask your questions, many of which were RAFO'd.

By the way, you'll be seeing the red R.A.F.O card going around now—I had to get one so I asked a question I knew he'd RAFO concerning Cyndane and Transmigration. I'll post what the card says on the back, although I'd be surprised if no one has done so already.

Thank you Brandon for humoring my fan freakishness and for being such a great person—Teri and I plan to include your creative suggestions to that story about the faxes from now on when we tell it to friends and family.
