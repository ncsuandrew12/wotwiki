# [Interview #482, Entry #4]: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#4)

#### Matt Hatch

I know you’ll RAFO this one but I’ll ask it anyway. Does the Creator, for a lack of a better word, weave the One Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### Matt Hatch

Ok. I’ll jump off the Creator for the moment...

#### Brandon Sanderson

How about this, I do know...Robert Jordan...there are answers to these things that you are wanting to know...

#### Matt Hatch

Do you believe they ever will be discussed, like Encyclopedia type of things or do you believe..

#### Brandon Sanderson

...he did not want to leave explicit answers about a lot of these things. There will be hints. So, they are a double RAFO because they are the sort of things Robert Jordan did not like to answer and they could spoil things [...] Double RAFO.

#### Matt Hatch

[Hah—I got a DRAFO]
