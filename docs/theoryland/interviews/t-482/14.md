# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#14)

#### Matt Hatch

Ok. Is Mordeth’s power, this evil power, comparable to the One Power and True Power? Is it a power that can be woven?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it’s more something along the lines of Perrin’s wolf power, something more natural; you couldn’t weave Mordeth.

#### Matt Hatch

Ok, so it’s more of a natural...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...it’s more of a natural, though it is unnatural. It’s an unnatural natural thing...

#### Matt Hatch

...because Jordan was really particular about...he tried to have a logic-based system as it pertained to the One Power. Is this power more supernatural in sense than it is based on physics?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Let’s say more instinctual, alright?
