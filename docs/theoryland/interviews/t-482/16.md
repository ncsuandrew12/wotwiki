# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#16)

#### Matt Hatch

You saw where we were going…

#### Brandon Sanderson

...yes, I see where you are going...

#### Matt Hatch

...I had to do the build up to it because it all comes down to that one question for a couple of things.

#### Brandon Sanderson

This one question you are going to ask next?

#### Matt Hatch

I’m not going to ask it...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...oh, the one you asked…

#### Matt Hatch

...yeah, I guess I asked a piece of it last night...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...when it comes to this certain character that you are talking about, there is a whole thing where Maria and I exchanged a bunch of emails about this. She had managed to pull some things out of the notes that I had not seen, which is interesting, because I was going off of something else. I did not think that Cyndane should be nearly as powerful as she was put in the books as being, so I had been under the belief that the Dark One was pulling shenanigans...

#### Matt Hatch

...like a little, in essence, let’s say what the Forsaken Lanfear did to Asmodean, you thought maybe the Dark One was doing some similar...shielding...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...or the other way around…here is a little extra power you can draw upon while I am pleased with you, I can take this away...

#### Matt Hatch

...that is a question...let’s jump to that question, there have been some theories that talk about Lanfear...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...let’s back up and say I was wrong. I was interpreting the notes a certain way. Maria was able to pull something out that I had not seen that made it clear that I had misinterpreted and that that is not the case, Cyndane is not under any shenanigans. What you see is what you get.

#### Matt Hatch

Cyndane and her alter ego have never been under any shenanigans?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not going to say never been under any shenanigans, but when you see her creating a gateway she is legitimately powerful enough to do it, which I did not believe that she was. Does that make sense? This is all digging into my read of the notes versus and Maria’s read of the notes and Maria was right. She was able to provide information to me that I had not seen which is nice because it was stuff that was very pertinent for what I am working on right now. It would have come out eventually when I would have sent her the scenes I’m working on, but it came out earlier, which is nice. Once I found out what was going on it all made perfect sense.

#### Matt Hatch

So, we will understand then in the next book or so why there is a decrease in power but not a significant decrease?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Matt Hatch

Ok, so that being said there are some theories out there that in the Age of Legends, at one point, Lanfear might have...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...let’s just say I have not said that Lanfear and Cyndane are the same person...

#### Matt Hatch

...Oh, absolutely, I’m jumping to this other Forsaken that we are talking about...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...this other completely different person...Uh huh...

#### Matt Hatch

...so Lanfear, the theory goes, that maybe she was accentuated from a beauty and/or power perspective by going to the Finnland previously...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...ok...

#### Matt Hatch

...would the Finns have the ability to accentuate someone’s beauty and/or quantity or access to the One Power through their own capabilities and talents?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it might involve third party
*ter’angreal, angreal*
, this sort of thing...

#### Matt Hatch

...so, they don’t have power to affect the soul’s capability of increasing its total channeling?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Certainly not permanently, as far I understand, that is outside the realm of their ability…

#### Matt Hatch

...from a beauty perspective can they affect the outer body of some individual?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that, yes they can, but they may have to be using some type of
*ter’angreal*
or...

#### Matt Hatch

...some item of power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some item of power, something like that...of which they have great stores...[what???]

#### Matt Hatch

...Really...heh, so the obvious question, where did the Finns get great stores of
*ter’angreal, angreal*
, and is that part of the Pact they made.?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO...but if you just think about it, we don’t even have to go to the notes for this if you think about it logically, we know of them providing certain items of power to certain individuals that they were able to match very nicely with certain requests very easily. If you run the statistics on that its either a huge coincidence or they have very many to choose from.
