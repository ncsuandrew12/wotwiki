# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#13)

#### Matt Hatch

I heard you answer a question last night, which sounded interesting. Someone asked about Padan Fain and Elaida.

#### Brandon Sanderson

A lot of people don’t remember that they met.

#### Matt Hatch

So, his influence, how long for example...wasn’t Egwene exposed to Padan Fain? Are there still effects that Egwene has on people because of him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Remember the idea that people have, generally, a choice. There are ways to turn people to the Shadow against their will, but when that happens the person is no longer the person. What is happening with Padan Fain is, naturally tendencies can be exacerbated or they can be fought off...

#### Matt Hatch

...so Elaida’s paranoia fed that? With someone like Egwene she might have fought it off, so it’s not going to be...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...right. exactly, or someone like Rand who continues to fight it off. He has become very paranoid. And the wound in his side, certainly someone could make the connection that that might have an influence. I won’t say for certain but...

#### Matt Hatch

...so, the suggestion is not only does he have the taint, which is negatively influencing him, or influencing him in such ways that might bring on paranoia, there is this accentuation of it because of Fain...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...this corruption...I mean that wound and the dagger...

#### Matt Hatch

...that is another source...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...Mat managed to fight it off pretty much completely, well not completely, but we don’t see Mat running around paranoid anymore...Elaida gave it something to feed upon and it was very very small and subtle with Elaida but certainly that was an influence.
