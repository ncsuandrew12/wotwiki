# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#6)

#### Matt Hatch

#### Brandon Sanderson

...they do and you don’t have to learn, and so that should tell you that the weaves are similar if not identical to the One Power. There are certain things the True Power can do that are different and it goes about things in different ways, but you don’t have to relearn everything.
