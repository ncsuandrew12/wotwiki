# [Interview #482: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Matt Hatch, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#18)

#### Matt Hatch

Ok, we’ll move on from there. Were male channelers across Randland able to feel Rand's use of the male Choedan Kal when he destroyed it atop Dragonmount?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would certainly think they would have been able to, consistent with what has happened before.

#### Matt Hatch

But did they know that it was destroyed? Is that what they felt, or was it just the use of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not believe the destruction of a
*sa’angreal*
would be the type of event that you would be able to notice. It is not consistent with what we have seen before.
