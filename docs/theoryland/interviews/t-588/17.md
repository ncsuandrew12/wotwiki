# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#17)

#### Lordjuss

Did Naeff bond Nelavaire or was it the other way around? Where did she come fromâ€”was she one of Cadsuane's companions or one of Toveine's assault force?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The other way around, and neither. Nelavaire is one of the 23 Aes Sedai who were captured at Dumai's Wells and later swore fealty to Rand.
