# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#11)

#### Dawn

I thought of one more question I had. The revelation of who Mesaana was impersonating inside of the White Towerâ€”was that something that RJ had dictated in his notes/outlines, or was that of your own creation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was directly from the notes. It was the person who most people had guessed it was, because of the foreshadowing that Robert Jordan put in.
