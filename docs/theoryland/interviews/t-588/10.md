# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#10)

#### Robert

Also, when Perrin sees Hopper after Hopper's death in the Wolf Dream, Hopper also appears to be a dark shadow of his former self, something sinister. Is this related to the change that is coming over the people at the Black Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're speaking of when Perrin tries to "resurrect" Hopper, so to speak. That is not related to what's happening at the Black Tower. That's something else entirely. And that's not even really Hopper. That is a projection of Perrin trying to bring Hopper back.
