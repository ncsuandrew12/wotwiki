# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#19)

#### Stublore

As regards the True Power, how come Rand was able to use it, when earlier we are told only those the Dark One allows can use it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Semirhage believed that the Dark One had specifically granted Rand the ability. I won't say whether that's true or not. There are other theories out there that I don't want to squelch. But one possibility—and she certainly believed it—was that Dark One, in his desire to corrupt Rand, gave him that ability.

#### Footnote

Brandon said
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#29)
that one typically has to go to Shayol Ghul to get permission to use the True Power, and many suspect that Rand's sensing of it is a product of the link between him and Moridin.
