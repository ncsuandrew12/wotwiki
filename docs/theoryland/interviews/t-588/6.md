# [Interview #588, Entry #6]: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#6)

#### Jet

There are some channelers who have lost strength in the Power (Siuan and Moiraine), is this something that can be Healed?

#### Cory

You have to still/gentle them again, and then have them "Healed" by a channeler of the opposite sex...thats why when Nynaeve healed Logain, he regained all his power.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a common theory. I do believe Robert Jordan RAFOed this very question, which is why I feel I need to RAFO it. It should be noted that Siuan doesn't want to try this, for various reasons.
