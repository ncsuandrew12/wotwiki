# [Interview #588, Entry #18]: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#18)

#### Lordjuss

Finally, a little request... The Land of the Madmen is mentioned in the Guide but never in the series itself. It would be lovely if it could at least be mentioned in one of the books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Your request is under consideration.
