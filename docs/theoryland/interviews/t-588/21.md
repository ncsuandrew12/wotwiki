# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#21)

#### Jet

Did you ever get bothered with how late Perrin's POV was and how chronologically disorienting his parts were at times (good job on the Tam being picked up and Rand in Dragonmount portions though)?

Did you like having to "jump back in time" or was it just something that had to be done as Perrin's was so late in the the WOT timeline?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This was an effect of the books spending so much time with so many people off target from one another. Eventually they were going to have to come together, and this was the best way that I was capable of doing it. Robert Jordan may have been able to do it better, but after the books were split, this was the best way I could do it.

#### Footnote

To quote Brandon from another interview: "The plotlines
