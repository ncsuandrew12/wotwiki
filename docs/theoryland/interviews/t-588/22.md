# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#22)

#### Machavelli

Hi Brandon. I was really looking forward to reading about Rand after the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
, where he changes. I want to know how much he has changed since he and Lews Therin became one. He is the main character but he is barely in this book. Why is that? and will we get to read from his point of view in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will get to read from his point of view in the last book. This was done intentionally, and it's something the Wheel of Time books have done all across the history of the series. Sometimes certain characters have to take a back seat while others' stories are being told. In this case, that happened to Rand. It was very important to me for narrative reasons that you see him externally before you see him internally.
