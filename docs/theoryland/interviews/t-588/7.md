# [Interview #588, Entry #7]: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#7)

#### Carrie (Care)

Brandon, I would love to know if we finally found out who Gaidal Cain was reborn as (or had a brief mention of him) in
*Towers of Midnight*
? I really thought it was obvious, but after talking to some friends I guess it wasn't. I realize you might not be able to say who it is, but if you could just let me know if we did hear mention of him in
*Towers of Midnight*
, that would be awesome.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know what you're talking about. I won't confirm 100% or not, but the phrasing was intentional.

#### Footnote

This is apparently in reference to Grady's son, who was (by Rand's estimate) four years old in
*Lord of Chaos*
and therefore too old to be Gaidal Cain (unless Grady has another son and didn't bother to mention the other to Rand, which seems unlikely).
