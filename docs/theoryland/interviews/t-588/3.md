# [Interview #588: Goodreads ToM Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=588#3)

#### Dawn

Will we be learning any more about Shara in the last volume?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will simply defer to what Robert Jordan on this. This is the story primarily of what we call the Westlands, or Randland (though he didn't use those terms). This is not the story of Shara or Seanchan. There will be no major action that takes place in those other realms. Interpret that as you will.
