# [Interview #356: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Done! (With something that...well, I can't tell you much about.), Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=356#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also, I want to leave a note for all of you who wrote me about
*Lightsong*
and
*Warbreaker*
over the last couple of days. It has been extremely helpful, and while I can't write an individual response to every one of you, I can leave a very large—and humbled—thank you here. So far, this project has been very fulfilling and successful. I don't know if that will help or hurt sales, but it has been useful in ways that sales can never indicate.

One last note. Alan Capps, you wrote me an email a few days ago and I just wrote a very long response—which bounced from your email box and came back undeliverable! So, if you'd email me again, I'd appreciate it. ;)
