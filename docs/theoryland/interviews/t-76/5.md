# [Interview #76: ACOS Signing Report - Mike Lawson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=76#5)

#### Mike Lawson

There were about 30-40 of us there who attended the signing, but I don't know who (if any) regularly read the group. So, unless someone else can independently confirm my description of the replies, I guess it's really only on my word that this is standing on...

(I don't suppose Ryan came down from OSU for the signing, did he??)

â€”Mike L.

Pam: I apologize for forgetting to send you the blurb about Asmodean; reformatting my mail for posting to the group jogged my memory about it...
