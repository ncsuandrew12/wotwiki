# [Interview #1173: Utah Humanities Book Festival, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1173#2)

#### Question

I also asked if hemalurgy could be performed anywhere in the Cosmere. Pretty sure that's something we knew already, but I asked if anyone could do it if they knew what they were doing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said Yes.

#### Question

So, I continued, hemalurgy is unique because not only can the power of Ruin be accessed anywhere (not just on Scadrial), but also by anyone (not just someone who's invested).

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said it is weird that way.

#### Footnote

:-) It is interesting: I can't think of any other Shardic power that's so universally accessible.
