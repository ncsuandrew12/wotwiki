# [Interview #949, Entry #7]: AMOL Signing Report - Viper](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#7)

#### Viper

Aons look like Arelon; soulstamps look like MaiPon. Aons get weaker when you get further from Arelon, right? That's not just cause Elantris acts like a focus?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's right, it's based on distance. That's why there are no stamped objects in Elantris.

#### Viper

So do soulstamps get weaker further from MaiPon? If you left Sel via Shadesmar and went to another planet, would the soulstamp stop working?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's correct.

#### Viper

Could soulstamps be carved that used Arelon as a base form instead of MaiPon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's very interesting, isn't it?
