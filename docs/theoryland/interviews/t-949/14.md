# [Interview #949, Entry #14]: AMOL Signing Report - Viper](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#14)

#### Viper

That was all that we asked him ... he seemed tired, so we didn't want to push it. Afterwards, I still had a few questions, but I didn't want to be an asshole to him.

My theory now involves Szeth being bound to his oathstone the way Kaladin is bound to Syl; I believe Honor was splintered near Urithiru (which was built "to the west, near Honor"), and I believe that this may have been in Shinovar. That's how he learned the lashings, etc. But we'll see.

Ok, that's it for now. I'll let you know if I remember anything else ...

Peace.

~Viper.
