# [Interview #949: AMOL Signing Report - Viper, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#5)

#### Viper

Ok real quick then I'll get back in line again. There's a bunch of people who follow this stuff online ... I just found out about it ... I don't want to call them a cult, but ... So anyway, at one point someone asked you if Seons were shards ofâ€”

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aona.

#### Viper

Devotion ... yeah Aona, and you said that was close. My question is: are the Aons at the HEART of the Seons shards of Devotion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but close.

#### Viper

But ... I was sure ... the floating Aon at the heart, that's not a shard ...

#### Brandon Sanderson

(taking pity on me) You're close but a word is wrong. You're using the wrong terminology.

#### Viper

SPLINTER. Are the Aons at the heart of Seons SPLINTERS of Aona?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Viper

Can I post that online?

#### Brandon Sanderson

. . . Ok. That's fine. It's been long enough, they've earned it.
