# [Interview #949: AMOL Signing Report - Viper, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#4)

#### Viper

Ok. The gemhearts/stormgems/whatever that are grown inside the beasts in

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's similar. The pits are an area where there's like a leak from the spiritual realm into the physical. That's what happens there.
