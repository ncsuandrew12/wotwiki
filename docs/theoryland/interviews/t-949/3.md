# [Interview #949: AMOL Signing Report - Viper, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#3)

#### Viper

Hah. So in Cosmere, does physics work the same way in the physical realm as it does in our world? Specifically, particle physics; and are atoms made up of protons and neutrons and electrons, and is light photons, etc?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Viper

So what's at the core of an atom of Atium? Ate-teum? Also how do you pronounce it? At-teum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. And the matter is just normal matter, but it's wrapped in the spiritual. The Spiritual DNA [or something] is what makes it magical.

#### Viper

(Note: he might've said slightly more about this but I didn't write it down and I don't remember. Sorry for not bringing a tape recorder :(/> )
