# [Interview #949: AMOL Signing Report - Viper, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#1)

#### Viper

Hi guys!

Quick intro:
  
I've been reading Brandon's books for about a year, and a few months ago I noticed some stuff about his novels. I googled "Hoid" and "Adonalsium" and holy crap what did I find! It felt like I took a bead of what I now know is called "lerasium".

So anyway, I had tried to read up on stuff on this forum and coppermind, etc, but I am still behind on knowing everything that's ever been asked/revealed. That in mind, I went to a signing he had tonight in Milford NH (middle of nowhere, right?) and asked him some questions. I also asked if I could post the answers he gave me online, and am respecting his wishes as to what can be said. While there I also met another Sanderson nerd (San-nerd-son?) who I discussed some things with to get his view. I had a list of questions and wrote down Brandon's answers. Forgive me if any of them have already been answered ...

It took me 2 turns through the line to get all my questions answered. All statements are approximations and not direct quotes.
