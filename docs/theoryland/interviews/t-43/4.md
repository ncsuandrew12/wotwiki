# [Interview #43, Entry #4]: KOD Signing Report - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=43#4)

#### Ted Herman

Got to ask two questions at signing part:

Who killed Alric?

#### Robert Jordan

One of the Aes Sedai's Warders did, not a sister.

#### Footnote

Alric was Siuan Sanche's Warder who was killed when she was deposed in
*The Shadow Rising*
.
