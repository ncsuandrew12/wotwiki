# [Interview #43: KOD Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=43#5)

#### Ted Herman

Since you said at an earlier signing that the Dark One couldn't have brought back Asmodean if he wanted, was that at the time of Asmodean's death, or after that?

#### Robert Jordan

The Dark One couldn't bring back Asmodean because of the combination of two factors: HOW HE DIED and WHERE HE DIED. Not one or the other, both factors.

#### Footnote

The referred to
[earlier question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=152#6)
was asked at the NYC Barnes & Noble signing on the

tour.
