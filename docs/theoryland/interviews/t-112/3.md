I also got him to pronounce the names of the Forsaken (well, some of them) onto tape for me. He only got a few, but get this. I said "Could you recite the names of some of the Forsaken?"

#### Robert Jordan

He said "Sure, Ishamael, Rahvin, Semirhage, who else? Moridin..."

#### JOEL GILMORE

Now, it could just be he was listing evil people, or it could be that he was giving me a subtle clue. We can't prove it either way, but it's more food for thought :)
