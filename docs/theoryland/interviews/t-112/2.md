#### Robert Jordan

I got an answer to the Rahvin/balefire/
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
questionâ€”when someone is balefired, the constructs they make in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
do not disappear, but instead fade away slowly over time. There are lots of weird effects associated with
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
and balefire, such as the way the world flickers after balefire used. I asked him just generally about it, and then he jumped straight in, gave the answer, then used the Rand and the fish example.
