# [Interview #112: Brisbane Signing Report - Joel Gilmore, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=112#6)

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, and one more thing: The Forsaken are reborn pretty much straight away when they die. "Not right on the heels, but close." That should make things interesting :)

Joel.

#### Footnote

Apparently Joel was talking about transmigration rather than rebirth (not that the official terminology is so clear), but even that assumption has to be called into question because of the delay with Aginor and Balthamel. Clearly they were just 'waking up' at the beginning of
*Lord of Chaos*
, and at that point they had been dead for some time. We do know from the
[TOR Questions of the Week](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#3)
that the Dark One has to grab the soul at the time of death, or shortly thereafter, but it may be that he can hold onto the soul for a while until a 'suitable body' is found.
