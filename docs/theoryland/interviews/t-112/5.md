# [Interview #112: Brisbane Signing Report - Joel Gilmore, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=112#5)

#### Joel Gilmore

I'm going to post the transcript as soon as I've done it (won't be till next week). I don't think it would be right to post any of his voice, although maybe just a couple of the Forsaken names would be okay?

Any suggestions? (post=on web page :0)

Hmmm, I think that's all. Oh, and I got a number of really cool posters. One side has the cover of
*The Path of Daggers*
(full spread), the other has all the book covers and the WoT logo. Very cool.

Cheers, Joel
