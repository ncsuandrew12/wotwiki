# [Interview #122: WH Signing Report - Ha T. Nguyen, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=122#2)

#### Ha T. Nguyen

I asked who killed Asmodean, the Hot New Choice (HNC) or Graendal?

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that one day he might answer this question, but, if people would just analyze where everyone was at the time, it could be figured out.

#### Ha T. Nguyen

So, I'm thinking, Graendal, since she is the only one who had a timeline that could be figured out. Currently, that is. Unless, someone comes up with one for the HNC.
