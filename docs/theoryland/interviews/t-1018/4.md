# [Interview #1018, Entry #4]: New Release Interview: Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1018#4)

#### Shawn Speakman

The book's main character, David, is out for revenge. At the beginning of the book, we see the event that led to that desire. Was it hard writing a character out for revenge in a young adult setting?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sometimes you write something and it just comes together, and that's what the prologue was for me. It introduces David, his driving motivation, and was what gave me the passion and excitement to write the book. For those interested in the book, I really do suggest reading the prologue, which is free online. [link:

I don't think David being a teen made the revenge aspect of the story more difficult. In fact, it felt like a very natural fit because of the passions of adolescence. Yes, at its core,
*Steelheart*
is a vengeance novel. David's passion for what he wants to do is a big driving force behind the whole story working.
