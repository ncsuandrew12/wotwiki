# [Interview #1018, Entry #6]: New Release Interview: Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1018#6)

#### Shawn Speakman

You have finished
*Words of Radiance*
and it publishes in early 2014. What are you currently working on? The sequel to
*Steelheart*
, I hope!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Actually, I'm working on the revisions for
*Words of Radiance*
. "Finished" should be in quotes. Yes, the first draft was turned in at the end of June, but since then, we've been working on revisions. It is a long, arduous process to take 400,000 words—1000 pages—and take it from good to excellent. We're in that process right now. However, I've often described how I can write one book while revising another—so I am indeed working on a sequel. The sequel to
*Steelheart*
, titled
*Firefight*
, which should be coming out in the fall of 2014 if everything goes well.
