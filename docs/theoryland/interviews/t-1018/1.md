It's about time! I am an eager Sanderson fan. I think he's one of the best writers working today, prolific without a fault, and one of the nicest people a fantasy fan can ever meet. He is also one of the best storytellers, filled with so many stories that he often doesn't have time to write them. It explains the diversity in the novels he has written.

*Steelheart*
is one such novel. It is a young adult novel and, like any great young adult novel, it has very adult themes.

Here is a bit more about it:

> From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn trilogy, Brandon Sanderson, comes the first book in a new, action-packed thrill ride of a series—
> *Steelheart*
> .
>   
> Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.
>   
> But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his will.
>   
> Nobody fights the Epics . . . nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.
>   
> And David wants in. He wants Steelheart—the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planning—and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.
>   
> He's seen Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.

I decided to send Brandon a few questions about this new novel! And he obliged me, doing something cool: He answered the questions in audio format specifically for this interview and these words are transcribed!
