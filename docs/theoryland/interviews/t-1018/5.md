# [Interview #1018: New Release Interview: Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1018#5)

#### Shawn Speakman

What book would you recommend your readers tackle AFTER they have read
*Steelheart*
? Young adult or otherwise!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Usually if people are not familiar with my work, I point them toward one of two things, either the original Mistborn trilogy or
*Warbreaker*
. Mistborn is a little more action-oriented.
*Warbreaker*
is a little more character- and humor-oriented.
