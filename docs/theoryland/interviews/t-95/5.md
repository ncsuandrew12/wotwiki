#### Question

Are there any characters in the books that are based on historical figures?

#### Robert Jordan

No. The groups are sometimes in ways based on historical organizations. The Whitecloaks have a lot of, say, Teutonic Knights. The Aes Sedai organization comes from the way convents were organized between A.D. 1000 and 1800, a time when there was real political power behind convents. There is one real-life individual who has contributed a lot. My wife has given me, involuntarily, at least one major character trait for all of the major female characters in the books. I'm very mean to her, I won't tell her which character traits I have taken. As she has pointed out to me, she knows where I sleep! So I consider it wise not to upset her, if I can avoid it.
