# [Interview #95, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=95#9)

#### Question

You've got an especially enthusiastic readership. How do you deal with people who take your books too seriously?

#### Robert Jordan

Depends on what they're writing to me about. I explain that no, there really isn't a One Power, there is no ability to channel, and I cannot teach you these things because they don't exist. And I'm not a guru, I'm not a spiritual leader, do not quit your job. I will not allow you to sit at my feet. Go on with your life. But I don't read a lot of fan comments. I don't go on the Web. I don't pay any attention to it.

#### Question

What about people who have compared your books to the Koran or the Bible?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm writing stories. I'm not creating a religion. I'm not starting a movement. I hope they're good stories and that they're entertaining people, but they're still just stories.
