#### Question

You've said before that you know where this series is going to end.

#### Robert Jordan

I've known the last scene of the last book for 15 years. I could have written it easily 15 years ago, and it would be only changes in the wording, not in what happens, from that to now.

#### Question

So will the male-female duality be resolved? Or is this a "read and find-out" question?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO. What I consider the major story lines will be resolved. There will be a number of minor story lines that will not be resolved, for the simple reason that there is no point to any real world where everything is resolved. That's always something that has irritated me about some novelsâ€”that you reach a point at the end of the book, and everyone's problems have now been solved, and all of the world's problems have been solved. I get the feeling I could put these characters and this world on a shelf and put a bell jar over them and go away. There's nothing left there alive. That's the way it's going to be. I even intend to set a small hook in the last scene.
