# [Interview #904: IMG Interviews Mistborn Creator Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=904#6)

#### Ted Bade

Will this game explore only the nobility of the Mistborn world or will it include some of the lower class elements? Are you going to bring in any aspects of the empire or the long planned revolution?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This story is taking place several hundred years after the Ascension of the Lord Ruler; 700 or 800 years before the events of the trilogy. I don't want to give any more spoilers than that, but there will be lots of things in the game dealing with lots of different aspects of the Mistborn world.
