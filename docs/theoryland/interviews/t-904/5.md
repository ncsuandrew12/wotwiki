# [Interview #904, Entry #5]: IMG Interviews Mistborn Creator Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=904#5)

#### Ted Bade

Do you intend to create a novel (or series) to go along with or to follow this game?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not intending that right now. There's a chance we'll do a graphic novel, but I feel like this story that I'm building matches the game, and I want it to be for the game.
