Introduction

We are always on the lookout for upcoming games here at Inside Mac Games. Recently, prolific fantasy author Brandon Sanderson announced that he was working with gaming company
[Little Orbit](http://www.littleorbit.com/)
to create
*Mistborn: Birthright*
, a game based on his
[Mistborn novel trilogy](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/book/Mistborn/)
. I was personally very excited about the game, as I have become a big fan of Mr. Sandersonâ€™s books and truly enjoyed the Mistborn series.

If you haven't read this fantasy trilogy and are a fan of fantasy novels, you should really consider reading it. As with all of Brandon Sanderson's novels, the universe he creates is completely unique in the realm of fantasy and is definitely not a rehash of existing fantasy worlds. All of the Mistborn books (including a newer spin off series) are excellent reads (or listens in the case of audiobooks!).

The "magic" of the Mistborn series manifests in the abilities of certain citizens to utilize the "special properties" of metals. There are two aspects for each metal, affecting others or oneself. Most people, if they have this ability, can work with only one metal, but there are a rare few who can utilize more then one. In his novels, Sanderson develops ingenious ways for his characters to make use of these abilities to help them achieve amazing things. I will leave it up to you to read the novels to learn more.

If you are familiar with the Mistborn series, the events of the game will take place about 700-800 years before the events of the trilogy. What I believe Sanderson and Little Orbit plan to achieve is an Action RPG that stands on its own, but still exists in the world he created.

Initially, the game was to be released for consoles and Windows PCs. Later, it was revealed that the PC game will be released for Steam and that a Mac OS X version will also be available.

I had the opportunity to submit a handful of questions to Brandon Sanderson about his plans for
*Mistborn: Birthright*
. The rest of this article shows my questions, his answers, and perhaps a final comment of my own.
