# [Interview #109: Sydney Independent Theatre Report - Sastan, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=109#7)

#### Robert Jordan

His wife was in fact a publisher, and it was through RJ's attempts to get published that he met her. He started dating her, and eventually married her. She did in fact offer to publish his book, but RJ realised it was not a good idea to have his wife as his sole source of income, so took it elsewhere. Another detail that I can remember (whoever was in the front row taping the event; could you write up his exact words throughout the session?) is that he used to write for a women's erotic "soft-porn" author, who gave him a headstart in the writing profession. His pronunciation was interesting, and he was humourous (Lady: "How can you deal with all the stress?" RJ: "I am a Warrior-God").

#### Footnote

The
[verbatim transcript](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=108#21)
of this question makes it clear RJ actually wrote bodice-rippers for Harriet, otherwise known as the
*Fallon*
books, and later Conan. Harriet herself
[has commented](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146#13)
on the 'warrior god' thing. Also, RJ did in fact publish his first book with Harriet, but then they started dating.
