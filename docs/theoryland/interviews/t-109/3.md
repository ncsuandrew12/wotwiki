# [Interview #109: Sydney Independent Theatre Report - Sastan, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=109#3)

#### Sastan

Again we were asked if we had any questions. Still silence, we were in awe of the Creator. Then one woman began bitching to him about how his series were affecting her. I don't recall exactly what was said, but I do remember the last part "How long do I have to love you for before you'll tell us?" We all cracked up, with RJ visibly shocked, stuttering "Could you repeat that?" After that everyone raised their hands, no longer shy.
