# [Interview #109: Sydney Independent Theatre Report - Sastan, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=109#6)

#### Sastan

There were other details about RJ himself that came out.

#### Robert Jordan

He mentioned the FAQ, and how only 1/3 of it is correct. Another 1/3 is completely wrong, and the remaining 1/3 is partly correct, but not complete, even though the FAQ concludes some of these. I think this means that the rasfwr-j regulars can stop flaming anyone who asks questions that are covered in the FAQ; NO, it is NOT an excuse anymore that you have discussed everything there is too discuss; according to RJ, 2/3 of your holy FAQ needs rewriting and revising.
