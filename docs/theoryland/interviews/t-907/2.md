Have you ever worked on a video game before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is my first extensive experience working on a video game. I have sold video game rights on one of my other books, but I haven't begun working on that yet.

#### Epic Games

How did you get involved with Infinity Blade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They approached me. The developers of Infinity Blade were fans of mine. They tell me they spent some six months trying to get hold of me, going through different channels. But they kept trying because they really wanted to work with me. Eventually they realized they had a contact with Isaac Stewart, who has done a lot of art for my books and is a good friend of mine. So through him they eventually got me to dinner to pitch working on this project with them.
