#### Epic Games

Which of the characters do you find most compelling and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Siris, our main character. I felt I really needed a protagonist who was compelling, so I did everything I could to make him fit the bill. I also think that Isa, the character I created to go alongside him, is very fun and very interesting, but certainly Siris is the most compelling.
