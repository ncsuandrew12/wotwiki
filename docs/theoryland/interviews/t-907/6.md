How does the novel,
*Infinity Blade: Awakening*
, fit within the game universe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a bridge directly from game one to game two. It begins basically right at the end of game one, and then game two overlaps. You get to play through the ending of the story, for the introduction to the game when you're going through the tutorial and whatnot. Then the game heads to new ground. This was actually really fun for meâ€”I liked writing something and then having them say, "Wow, we're going to make this part of the game. It'll be our prologue."
