#### John Ottinger

Brandon Sanderson is the author of the forthcoming thirteenth novel in the Wheel of Time series created by Robert Jordan. He is the author of the popular YA series of
*Alcatraz*
novels, and has written two stand-alone novels and a trilogy.
*The Way of Kings*
(
[my review](http://www.graspingforthewind.com/2010/08/24/book-review-the-way-of-kings-by-brandon-sanderson/)
) is the beginning of an epic series set to rivel Goodkind, Jordan, or Eddings in length and breadth. While in the process of completing
*Towers of Midnight*
, Brandon was kind enough to pause and answer a few questions I had about his newest solo project.
