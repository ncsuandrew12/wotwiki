Brandon started the event by reading the scene of Talmanes riding to the rescue of Caemlyn. He mentioned that he has always appreciated the relationship between Talmanes and Mat, and so he was excited to see so much from Talmanes in RJ's prologue. He said Talmanes' prologue appearance is one of his favorites.

He chose to read the Wind scene at the beginning of Chapter One as well, because the wind followed the route of the three

on their journey. It is a scene that is symbolic of the series, and very special to him just as it is to the fans.

After the short reading, we moved on to the Q&A.
