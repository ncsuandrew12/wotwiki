# [Interview #915: AMOL Signing Report - Deslya, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=915#16)

#### Question

Do you know what the Tinkers meant in the [sixth] book, as they were dying and they said "tell the Dragon Reborn"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know. It might be in the notes. When I say "RJ's notes", it means one of two things. It is either a pile that his assistants collected, or the things he wrote for himself about the world. I'd ask Harriet and Maria a question, and they'd act like Google. Reading it all myself would've taken months, and the majority is about stuff already written and known. But really, I have no idea what you're talking about.

#### Footnote

This is in reference to a scene in
*Lord of Chaos*
where Vanin finds a slaughtered Tinker caravan with the indicated message. Matt Hatch clarified the question with Brandon after the Q&A. Brandon said that he didn't know if it meant something more than literally telling the Dragon Reborn about their deaths, but that it might be in the notes.
