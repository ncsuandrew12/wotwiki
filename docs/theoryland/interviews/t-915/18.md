The signing line wrapped around the perimeter of the bookstore which gave fans the chance to peruse Weller Book Works amazing and unique collection of books. Seriously, if you're ever in Salt Lake,
go to this store
. Brandon, in his remarks, reminded everyone to support bookstores like these; there would be no good place to have book signings without bookstores, and it's a bit difficult to sign books at the web stores. Memory Keeper Brigitte went through the line playing WoT hangman with fans who were waiting. Brandon took his time with each fan answering their unique (or spoilery) questions. One guy, who is a shoe-in for Perrin's body double, asked Brandon to sign his bicep. That happened.

As a special treat for all of us, the fantastic folks from
[Badali Jewelry](http://www.badalijewelry.com/)
were also at the signing, and they brought great serpent rings, WoT character signet rings, a couple foxhead medallions and much more. They sold more than just WoT items; they also sold items inspired by some of Tor's other series. We saw jewelry from Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller series and Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series. They also generously donated an Asha'man dragon pin, which we auctioned off benefiting the Waygate Foundation, and gave us two items to giveaway—Moiraine's headpeice and a Mistborn metal alphabet.

Thanks to Tor Books and Badali Jewelry, the giveaways were really stellar. We paired
*Memory of Light*
messenger bags with a WoT trivia booklet and a paperback of
*Way of Kings*
or
*Memory of Light*
iPhone case. We had so much to share with fans that if we had done it all separately, we wouldn't have gotten through it all! Everyone had raffle tickets, and many people stuck around for the giveaways after their books were signed—which created a nice cluster of excited fans getting to know each other while they waited. We were raffling off every 5 minutes or so, and kept going until 10pm. The bookstore let us take that large book cover poster from the lectern, and we gave that away too with Brandon's signature on it. The fans were thrilled at that one.

Marc, Brigitte, Michael, Brandon, Charlotte, Chris, Deb and Taylor

The evening drew to a close and we Memory Keepers stuck around to visit and help Brandon as he signed and personalized pre-ordered books for the store. We had all wished for a little more time with him (who wouldn't?), so used the time to pester him with more questions in-between books. We had a discussion about the swords of WoT and learned that most blademaster swords in the books were katanas, much to our surprise, as many of us had imagined them being larger weapons.

We all had an amazing time being part of this experience, this moment in WoT history, and it's not an event we'll soon forget. Our sincere thanks to Dragonmount.com for giving us this opportunity!

Signed,

The SLC Memory Keepers
