#### Question

Is the Flame of Tar Valon weave going to be learned by others?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was witnessed. That's it.

#### Chris W.

There was a little more to the question above, but I left it out of this log for two reasons: One, I had a really hard time keeping up with the person asking the question, not to mention Brandon trying to answer, plus the guy who asked the question broke the "no spoilers in the Q&A" rule.
