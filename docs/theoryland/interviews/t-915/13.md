#### Question

What was the hardest part about writing in RJ's universe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably keeping track of all the side characters. There were so many. I'd be reading a scene and be like "there's seven Wise Ones, now who are they again?" Now as the writer I need to know who they are exactly, as well as each of their distinct voices. When I get them wrong, people notice and I hear about it.
