#### Question

You work on 4 or 5 series at time, how do you keep them from leaking (into each other)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a challenge. Being a writer is a lot like a juggler, keeping the balls in the air. One of the things I worry about is repeating myself. It's a valid thing, making sure you don't do that and keep them separate. I use an extensive wiki for myself and my books. A lot of my childrens' series are breather novels, and things I do between big epics where I don't have to worry so much about continuity. There's a lot of continuity with
*The Way of Kings*
and books like that, so it can be very in depth and intensive, so to keep my sanity, every once in a while I'll take a breather.
