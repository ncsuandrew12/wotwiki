#### Question

Is there a confirmed killer for Asmodean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's listed in the Appendix of
*Towers of Midnight*
. It's in there. Go find it. I found it by way of a post it note listed on top of the notes. I don't know any more than who did it, as far as why or how. There's only a name.
