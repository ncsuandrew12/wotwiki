# [Interview #892: AMOL Book Tour - Skokie Q&A, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=892#11)

#### Question

That charity drive that you draw names from? Originally it was mentioned that they would be represented by a group, or army at the Last Battle. What group?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will find them in there. They call them Dragonsworn. They are a group of unaligned Dragonsworn which include people who have just left their oaths behind and joined this group. There are Aes Sedai in there; there are Aiel in there; there are people from all around, and that group represents the fandom. They just call themselves the Dragonsworn.
