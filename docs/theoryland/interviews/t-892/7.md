#### Question

With the Oath Rod, the Aes Sedai obviously were not using it for its intended purpose. Let's talk about those two
*ter'angreal*
that they had in the White Tower, the one that they raise the Aes Sedai with, and the one that the Accepted use. And I'm curious, what was the intended purpose back in the Age of Legends for those?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, excellent question; I'll repeat it just for those who might not have been able to hear it. We know that the Aes Sedai are using certain
*ter'angreal*
for things other than their original intended purpose, such as the Oath Rod and the ones they use in the raising ceremonies. (to Maria) What
*were*
their intended purposes? [laughter]

#### Maria Simons

I don't know. [laughter, applause]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sorry. Robert Jordan could answer that. Sometimes we can't.
