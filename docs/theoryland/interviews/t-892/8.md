# [Interview #892: AMOL Book Tour - Skokie Q&A, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=892#8)

#### Question

Where do we go to learn how to pronounce some of these names?

#### Brandon Sanderson

On the encyclopaedia-wot, he actually pronounces them and has audio files. (to Maria) Am I correct? (Maria agrees.) And he's dead on. And I actually—it's kind of a fun story here. When I found that out, before I even started writing—because I was embarrassed about my pronunciations, and I still don't get some of them right—I went and I downloaded all of those, because he has just a batch file that you can download, and I put them on my iPod to shuffle between my songs, and so occasionally—even still—when I'm working out, I'll be sitting there, you know, going along on the treadmill, and then the song ends and I hear, "Rhuidean", and then I go back [laughter] Oh, I don't get that one right? No. Wait, are you sure I don't get that one right? Rhuidean. What did you say? (Maria pronounces Rhuidean.) Okay, "Rhuidean". There's a story, though. I once asked how to pronounce Morgase's name, and these two disagreed, and had a nice argument about it over dinner. [laughter]

#### Maria Simons

Another place for some pronunciations: At Dragonmount they have a 4th Age podcast, and at one point they interviewed me and Alan and had us go down
[a huge list of things for pronunciation](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#18)
, and it's still
[on Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/podcast/podcast-episode-79-interview-with-team-jordan-
r77)
somewhere.

#### Harriet McDougal

But it's my considered opinion, that however you pronounce any of the names, you are right. [laughter, applause]
