Then the big moment arrived: it was time for the Q&A! The Memory Keepers kept to the back, while Brandon directed which sections he'd take questions from when, and repeated the questions back for all of us to hear. I don't specifically remember many of the questions, but I certainly learned a lot about Brandon, Harriet, and the Wheel of Time project as a whole.

At the end of this time, Harriet read the first two paragraphs of the first chapter of
*A Memory of Light*
(

), and Brandon explained how the book signing process was to go. For the first round, he and Harriet would simply sign all of the books and get pictures taken if requested. If someone wanted it personalized, they could wait until everyone had been through the line, and then we'd go through the numbers again. This system ended up working VERY well.
