# [Interview #881, Entry #5]: AMOL Signing Report - Aiel Heart](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=881#5)

#### Aiel Heart

There were nearly three hundred people at this event, and though the Q&A had started at 7:00, we were able to make it through the first round of numbers around 10:00. We said our goodbyes to Harriet, and after a few more autographs and pictures, she departed for the hotel.

I had to leave partway through the second round, but it seemed like it would be done well before midnightâ€”perhaps even by 11:00.

I am very proud of the Memory Keepers that volunteered at this event. Each of them did their part and contributed many ideas and smiles to the night, helping it be a success. I doubt any of us will forget it any time soon.
