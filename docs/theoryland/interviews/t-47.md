## [Entry #1](./t-47/1)

#### Eric C. Piquette

I went to the signing last Friday down by the coast and thought I'd give a small report. I got there about 5 min. before 6:00, and not many people were there yet. I was #11. RJ was late, so in the meantime there was a discussion about WoT. Most of the the discussion centered on this group. Myself, Julie Kangas, and a couple other rasfwrj-ers explained to non-net fans about the group and about information gleaned from previous signings. (btw, if MIGHTY MORGNO was truly looking for other net readers, I fear he suffered from the rare malady of "can't see the forest for the trees.")

## [Entry #2](./t-47/2)

#### Eric C. Piquette

I asked RJ where the equator was in Randland.

#### Robert Jordan

He then pointed to Illian on a map and said that it corresponded approximately to the Florida Keys.

## [Entry #3](./t-47/3)

#### Eric Piquette

I also asked his wife if she was having fun touring the U.S.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

She said yes, but also that it was tiring.

#### Eric C. Piquette

Indeed, RJ looked like he was ready for the whole thing to be over with, but he still maintained a friendly demeanor. I also really liked his hat.
