#### Dave Brendon

We know you can’t say anything specific or even in general about what takes place in
*A Memory of Light*
, but you have to be able to answer this one, at least—does Bela save the day? :-)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m afraid Bela’s future exploits are still under wraps, but I have already revealed that it was Bela (with the assistance of Narg) who killed Asmodean.
