# [Interview #238: KOD Signing Report - Tremul, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=238#9)

#### Tremul

I'm still in San Fran and I forgot my Digital Camera link so I will post pictures from the signing as soon as I get home (Saturday). This was my first signing and it was so good I'm trying to figure out how to make it to the Half Moon Bay signing tomorrow. Here's to hoping.
