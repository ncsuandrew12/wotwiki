#### Hailing Frequency

In many places in "The Wheel of time," a careful reader will spot echoes of other myth cyclesâ€”the sword in the stone, for example. Do these things happen fortuitously or are they laid on in advance, intentionally as it were?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, they were laid on in advance. There are elements from Norse, Chinese, Japanese, and American Indian mythologies, to name just a few. I think it adds resonance to the story, although I've taken great care not to follow the older material in any slavish way. Occasionally, I will add in details here or there, and then discover that I have done something that is absolutely authentic to the myth I was working from. This is not automatic writing or channeling or being guided by something from the Great Beyond, it's simply that I have done a great deal of reading on these subjects and things bubble up in the back of my head all the time.
