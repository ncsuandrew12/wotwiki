#### Hailing Frequency

What are some of the things that have shifted and/or expanded as the books have started to fall into place?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, the characters, of course, have grown in directions I didn't quite expect. Or rather in
*ways*
that I didn't expect. It always happens that way...they're like mushrooms you know. The general outline I started with is still there. The high points that I'm aiming at are still there. But I've simply realized that telling the story is taking a little more time than I thought it would.
