#### Hailing Frequency

Hailing Frequency interview featured in the Walden Books sci-fi/fantasy newsletter, issue 4 in October/November of 1993.

Readers who like their fantasy on the grand scale, with a large cast of characters, a far-ranging geography, and a deeply layered history have been turning to Robert Jordan's epic, "The Wheel of Time," of which
*The Shadow Rising*
is the fourth installment. (Previous volumes include
*The Eye of the World*
,
*The Great Hunt*
, and
*The Dragon Reborn*
, all from Tor.) The series is abundantly complex and resonates with depth, so recently when we asked Robert Jordan for a
*brief*
summary of the action to date, the author laughed.

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think it's possible to summarize the story briefly. There's too much going on. For the last book,
*The Dragon Reborn*
, the publisher asked me for a synopsis of the first two books; it was to be sent out with review copies in case the reviewer had not read them. The synopsis was seven or eight pages longâ€”I could not get it down any further. My editor tried to cut it down some, too, but she couldn't find a way to take out more than a page or so on each book.
