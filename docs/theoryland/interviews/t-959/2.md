Sanderson almost didn't take on the role. Not for lack of interest; rather, because he was too much of a fan.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"That was actually a consideration in this for me," he says. "I would not be able to read a Wheel of Time book when everyone else got to.

"I balanced it with the knowledge that I got to go and read the ending he wrote. Because he did write the last chapter of the series himself before he passed away.

"I got to read that basically before anyone else except for his wife and his assistants. Getting to read it a few years early was a pretty big advantage."
