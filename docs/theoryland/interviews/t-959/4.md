# [Interview #959, Entry #4]: Final fantasy: Epic fan takes the Wheel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=959#4)

#### Giles Hardy

So, as the wheel comes full circle, as millions of Wheel of Time fans approach that final chapter written by Jordan, having farewelled many beloved characters and witnessed a Last Battle that exceeds expectations, and having experienced the joy, and shock, of recognising how many events were so expertly yet obliquely foreshadowed 14 novels, 23 years and 4 million words ago, there is a bitter-sweet realisation that it is too soon. This immensely satisfying conclusion is still not enough.

Perhaps it's time to start rereading from book one.
