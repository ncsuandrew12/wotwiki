# [Interview #959: Final fantasy: Epic fan takes the Wheel, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=959#3)

#### Giles Hardy

One other consideration almost held Sanderson back.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I sat there thinking, 'I'm setting myself up to fail. No matter how good a job I do, it's not going to be Robert Jordan's book. Why am I saying yes?'"

#### Giles Hardy

Once more, his passion as a fan won out.

"The thing that made the distinction for me was when I realised if I said no and someone messed it up, I would be responsible. If I wanted to make sure that a fan took control of The Wheel of Time and did it in a way that a fan would, then I needed to do it myself.

"My job is not to save The Wheel of Time, to fix The Wheel of Time, or anything like that. My job is not to screw it up."
