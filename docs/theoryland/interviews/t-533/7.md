# [Interview #533: Stomping on Yeti: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=533#7)

#### YetiStomper

How do you set out to write a 1,000 page book? How do you set out to write a 10 volume series? How did you make a decision what to include in
*The Way of Kings*
and what to leave out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lots of trial and error, mixed with a very, very detailed outline. I spent a lot of time on my outline, and it's very expansive. But really, this is a question to ask after I've finished the series. Right now I'm very optimistic about being able to do it all.

Let's see if I can actually pull it off.
