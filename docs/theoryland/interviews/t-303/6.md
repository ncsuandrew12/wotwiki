#### Robert Jordan

For Piercy, I am Episcopalian, though rather High Church. I haven't been up to attending services this last year, but either the rector or one of the deacons comes by to give me communion, so I feel that I'm not missing everything. There was a time I could have made the one block to the Cathedral of St. Luke for communion, but before he died John Paul II put the kibosh on that. Oh, well.
