#### Question

What is the setup for the prequels?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon responded that he is not sure. He states that he doesn't want it to be an eternal series, and suggests being very careful. He will go with whatever is the will of Harriet. Also possible to do outriggers, again depends on Harriet. There is a chance of both, Tom Doherty wants them both, so in the end it will be up to Harriet and Brandon will go along with whatever she wants and decides on.
