#### Question

What's most difficult in the writing process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Keeping track of everyone. I was confused about who was with Perrin, so I asked Charleston for a file with every one of the Two Rivers characters, who's with them. They sent over a file of a complete list of Two Rivers folk with Perrin, most of whom hadn't even been mentioned, and it had things like their names, relations, and for most of them, what they did in the army.
