# [Interview #448: TGS Signing Report - Peter Binkowski, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=448#4)

#### Question

How do you keep from being burnt out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that he switches projects continually. He wrote 13 standalone books before he ever got one published, that being
*Elantris*
, his sixth novel. "I write compulsively." That's where Alcatraz came from: he needed a break from Mistborn, and so he stopped for a time and wrote a light Young Adult novel. He would often take a Saturday off in the middle of a project, and write something completely different, something he wasn't necessarily supposed to.
