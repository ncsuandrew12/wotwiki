#### Question

Which character do you most identify with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that it depends on when he read the series through. When he first started reading he really was identifying with Rand, simply because they were both teenagers, so he naturally connected with how he felt. Then he started feeling for Perrin, slightly more mature, also because of the similarities in personality. This last time he read through the series for
*The Gathering Storm*
, he most identified with Moiraine and Nynaeve, because he, as a father in his 30's, can see the wisdom and guidance that they have to impart, and how better things would be if the boys just did what they were supposed to, unlike when he was younger when he would simply wish that they would stop butting in all the time.
