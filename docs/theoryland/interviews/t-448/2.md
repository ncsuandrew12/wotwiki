#### Question

What are the new chapter symbols?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Harriet names the chapters actually, so she sent over a list of all symbols and chapters, and wanted me to pick out symbols to go with the chapters. Brandon pushed for new symbols. He wanted a symbol to show the pattern unfurling. So that's what you get with chapter. Also Brandon chose Perrin's blacksmith puzzle for his own symbol on the author page.
