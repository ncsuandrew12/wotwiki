## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#1)

#### Question

In which published book is Hoid the happiest ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is the happiest when he is getting away with something. Not in the Stormlight Archive because he is nervous about Odium being there. I think he is the happiest during the Wax and Wayne series, in bands of mourning maybe.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#2)

#### Question

I was there too! I asked him if Wit was always gonna tell Kaladin a story in every book,

#### Brandon Sanderson

he said Wit will always tell someone a story, but it won't always be Kal.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#3)

#### Question

My wife asked if we would regret naming our firstborn Kaladin (seeing as we don't yet know how Kal turns out), and

#### Brandon Sanderson

he said "you'll probably be very happy naming your son that" haha, so there's that.

#### Question

When writing Stormlight, did you get any inspirations from the Chinese Confucian system? The Azish government really reminds me of that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So... Yes. Um... Chinese. 新年快乐? This is my only Chinese. [It means] Happy new year. So yes. Living in Korea for several years, I became very interested in the Confucian system. When I returned back from Korea, I studied in college about Chinese history and I found it fascinating. So the Azish are partially inspired by the Chinese Confucian system.

#### Question

Also a weird question, has Hoid ever had a romantic interest?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid has had romantic interest in the past.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#6)

#### Question

Do you have any further plans about Moash? Will he have more screen time in Stormlight 3?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have big plans for Moash, and he will actually have viewpoints in Stormlight 3. So good question!

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#7)

#### Question

So WoR mentions a particularly bright star known as the Tear (a reference to a tear shed by somebody named Reya) is that "star" actually one of the other planets in the greater roshar system, if so is it Ashyn or Braize?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#8)

#### Question

Is Thaidakar the leader of the Ghostbloods?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Is A leader.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#9)

#### Question

Are the Ghostbloods and the Seventeenth Shard working together?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#10)

#### Question

Who is the woman on the "Voidbringer Chart" ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Isaac did the art. It is just a pattern. She's no character in particular.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#11)

#### Question

KR seemed to have opposite gender spren. Why is Glys male then ? Is there something hidden there ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More naturally, the spren is opposite gender but it doesn't have to be. It's not a indication necessarily of homosexuality, but sometimes it is, sometimes it's not. More often, you'll attract spren of the opposite gender, but spren genders are very fluid anyway. You're not supposed to read anything specific into that.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#12)

#### Question

Question about the stormlight itself : a highstorm, full of stormlight, fills the spheres. Then, the KR use the stormlight or the stormlight evaporates with time. Question : where does the stormlight in highstorms come from ? Is there like a "rain cycle", but for the stormlight ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

the stormlight in the highstorm is transferred from the Spiritual realm through the Stormfather into the highstorm.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#13)

#### Question

At the end of tWoK, in the last Dalinar's vision, he stands "in a place of smoke. He turned about, wary. The sky was dark and he stood on a field of dull, bone-white rock, jagged and rough, extending in all directions. Off into eternity". Is this place Damnation/Braize ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That will be explained in Oathbringer. So RAFO.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#14)

#### Question

Can you give us a hint on the madman identity, the man everyone think he's Taln ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon (with a big smile) : Everyone think he's Taln !

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#15)

#### Question

is he fascinated by gravity ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes he finds incredible the capacity of mass to bend space and he loves gravity that's why it is everywhere (and it is awesome)

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#16)

#### Question

will Shai have a role in the next elantris books ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes she will have a role in the future elantris books or at least a cameo in them if not (i assume that we might see her in one of the 2 books and a small cameo in the other one)

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#17)

#### Question

I wondered about Shallan's eidetic memory, and about the possibility of trapping a spren. Could a bonded spren be trapped inside a gemstone and trapped in a safe ? If so, would something else - not Investiture related - fill the "crack in the soul" ? Could that be linked to her memory or her need to draw before Lightweaving ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In and about, he answered that what Shallan does isn't out of the ordinary (which I'm not certain, she shouldn't have to draw before Surgebinding, as she has done before. And does again in Ch. 88. Maybe it is Ideal-based ?), and it is possible to trap a bonded spren inside a gemstone.
