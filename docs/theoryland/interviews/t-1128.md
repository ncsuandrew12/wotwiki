## Entry #1

#### Kaladin al'Thor

So I noticed during my last read through of WoR that when Adolin summoned his blade, it formed from mist in the shape of vines. Does this mean that the Radiant that the blade was originally bonded to was an Edgedancer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, yes it does. (He also had a huge mischievous smile).

## Entry #2

#### Kaladin al'Thor

1) So I was wondering, if Adolin were to make the same exact oaths, could the Shardblade be revived?
2) So it could happen if something else also happened?

#### Brandon Sanderson

1) Something more would have to happen.
2) Yes.
