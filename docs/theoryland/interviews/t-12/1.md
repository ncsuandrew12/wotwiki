# [Interview #12: Letter to Carolyn F., Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=12#1)

#### Robert Jordan

Dear Carol,

Thank you very much for the copy of
*The Chronicles*
. I was not aware that I had fans who followed my work so closely. It is a real pleasure to discover. I apologize for the delay in writing, but in addition to writing (which takes no small amount of time), I have been on a round-the-world promotional trip and a close family member had to have open heart surgery, both of which occupied me fully. I do not have access to Prodigy, but please keep me on your mailing list through Tor.

By the way, the capture of Yurian Stonebow did not "bring and end to the Trolloc Wars" (Guide to WoT). Yurian Stonebow "rose from the ashes of the Trolloc Wars." That is, he came along after the wars ended.

#### Footnote

This 'Guide to WoT' was something in the fan club newsletter; the Big White Book was published a few years later. The first quote is probably from this 'guide', and the second is from
*The Great Hunt*
.
