#### Jason Wolfbrother

Yes Isabel I handed RJ your letter and 63 page dissertation on Asmodean. I told him that Isabel says hi and that she asked me to deliver this to him since she was grounded and couldn't make it.

#### Robert Jordan

He made a note on the front letter at the top and underlined it "Grounded".

#### Jason Wolfbrother

I begged him not to kill the messenger and he did notice my shirt, "You? No!" but did not comment.
