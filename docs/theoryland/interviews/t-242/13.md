# [Interview #242: KOD Signing Report - Jason Wolfbrother, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#13)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

He was very nice and friendly. He wasn't personalizing any of the signings though since there were so many people. There were a couple of people dressed as Whitecloaks. RJ saw them when they came up, "not my favorite people, but the costumes look good".

I tried to catch some questions others asked while having their books signed but didn't hear any that were relevant to the plot of WoT.
