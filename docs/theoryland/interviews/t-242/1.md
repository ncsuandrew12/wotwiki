# [Interview #242: KOD Signing Report - Jason Wolfbrother, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#1)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Just got back from the book signing in San Jose. Got to meet Frenzy and Jason from Dragonmount. Both very nice people in person. Frenzy isn't as scary as she would like you to think although I refrained from discussing Asmodean with her as she is the Faction Champion of the Apathy for Asmodean faction.
