# [Interview #242, Entry #8]: KOD Signing Report - Jason Wolfbrother](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#8)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

What is the second most powerful
*sa'angreal*
for men? Will it make an appearance?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

I should clarify this. RJ said that many misinterpret RAFO. When he says RAFO, all he is saying is that the information might already be in the book and you need to read more carefully, or that it might be something he wants to use at a future point and doesn't want to give away at this point in time. It does not mean that it will show up later for certain. People are making assumptions and guesses and adding things to what RAFO actually means.
