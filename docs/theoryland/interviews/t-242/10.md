# [Interview #242: KOD Signing Report - Jason Wolfbrother, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#10)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Can a channeler fly without any
*ter'angreal*
or equipment (like sho-wings) if he or she knows the right weave?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Flat out, no hesitation, no thinking. Simply put, NO.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Is it possible to for two channelers to lift each other simultaneously so that they can hover, and "fly" that way? Because he answered the previous question as he did I did not ask this one as it is obviously, to me at least a 'No' also.
