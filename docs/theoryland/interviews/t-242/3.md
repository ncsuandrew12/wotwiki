# [Interview #242, Entry #3]: KOD Signing Report - Jason Wolfbrother](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#3)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Frenzy had some friends that took our picture with RJ and we got our books signed. The Q&A was pretty much nonexistent as there were a lot of people waiting to have books signed. However, I stuck around til the line thinned out and was able to ask 11 questions and get 10 answers and a RAFO.

So here goes, the questions I asked and the answers RJ gave. Note these are not direct quotes (I didn't have a tape recorder), but I wrote down his answer as he said it. Most are short answers, only a couple were more than a few sentence explanations.
