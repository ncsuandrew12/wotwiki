# [Interview #242: KOD Signing Report - Jason Wolfbrother, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=242#7)

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Was
*Callandor*
constructed during the War of Power?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Was it used in the War of Power?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, that is how the flaw was discovered.

#### Jason Wolfbrother

Why didn't they ward/buffer
*Callandor*
?

#### Robert Jordan

The flaw with
*Callandor*
is simply a manufacturing flaw. He went on to talk about how they were at the end of their tech age with only a few sho-wings and jo-cars left. A couple of shocklances were still around but they were not as prevalent as they had been. Anyway they had been mass producing
*ter'angreal*
,
*angreal*
, and
*sa'angreal*
, and there are bound to be flaws with the products. The flaw with
*Callandor*
is simply one such flaw.

#### Footnote

This is specifically referring to the lack of a buffer.
