I donated a signed first edition of
*Mistborn*
for an auction at Con or Bust, which helps fans of color attend SFF conventions.

The most recent Writing Excuses podcast episode talks about

. Believe it or not, yesterday was the five-year anniversary of the
[very first episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/02/10/)

I have a bunch of videos for you today. My friend and former roommate Earl Cahill filmed the midnight release Q&A for
*A Memory of Light*
from multiple angles, and has produced the three videos below. If you weren't able to attend, check them out! There aren't any spoilers, if you were wondering.

, which you can see below:

Check out this great family costume from the

The third of my
[Stormlight Archive 2 writing videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTEyK9FoD8&hd=1)
is now up on YouTube. Be sure to watch it in 720p for the best quality. I WILL be posting a sped-up version of the whole chapter once I'm done posting all of the videos; if my typing is too slow for you, don't worry.
