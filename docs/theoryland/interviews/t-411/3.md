# [Interview #411: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Three Random Updates, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=411#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Finally, to end this all off, I visited a school a couple weeks back and did a presentation. During the signing after the presentation, I noticed one of the girls getting a book signed had a book full of manga sketches. I complimented her on the art, and her response was to offer me some fanart.

So, of course, I asked her to draw me in a rock band with Naruto, Vampire Hunter D, and some pokemon. (Isn't that what you would have done?) The glorious result is below. Thanks Arielle! You made my day, and not just because you drew me with the slim bod of a rock star. ;)
