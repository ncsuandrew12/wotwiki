# [Interview #257: AudioFile Interview: Talking With Robert Jordan, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=257#2)

#### Steven Steinbock

The Wheel of Time series, set in a timeless age of heroes that bears some resemblance to Arthurian England and Norse Europe, details the battles of Light against Darkness.
*Knife of Dreams*
is the eleventh volume of a projected twelve-book series (not counting one published prequel with several other prequels planned).

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan feels that his ability to create characters is his strongest asset as a storyteller. "I really believe that I can make a character real in the space of a sentence."
