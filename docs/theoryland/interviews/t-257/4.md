#### Steven Steinbock

Ten of the Wheel of Time novels are available in unabridged format from Books on Tape and Audio Renaissance. All of these are co-read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading.

#### Robert Jordan

"It was my suggestion in the first place," Jordan admitted, "that we have a male and a female actor to do this, a woman to read the female point of view and a man to read the male point of view. And we lucked out in that they both do voices as well. So it is as close as I can come to having an ensemble doing the reading."

In addition, Jordan's Western novel,
*Cheyenne Raiders*
, available as a digital download from Books on Tape, is read by Michael Kramer.
