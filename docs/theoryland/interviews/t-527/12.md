#### Question

The Aelfinn and the Eelfinn. Are there more? Did I miss huge tracts of information about them throughout the books, because I feel very unknowledgeable by going into this book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You have not missed anything if you have read the sequences where people go through the Redstone doorways. You have the same information that everyone else has, except for a few Theorylanders who've asked very obscure questions of Robert Jordan.

#### Terez

[And you](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#16)
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But yeah, you know what you need to know from that and from the discussions in the book. And the things you need to know will mostly be re-covered in this book.
