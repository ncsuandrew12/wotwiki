# [Interview #527, Entry #1]: DragonCon 2010 Q&A Report - Marie Curie](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=527#1)

#### Marie Curie

Finally, I've had a chance to transcribe the Q&A with Brandon after the
*Towers of Midnight*
Prologue reading on 4 September 2010 at Dragon\*Con. As has been mentioned before, though, the only really interesting comments were related to the \_\_\_\_\_\_ in the Blight, which has already been posted.

There were a couple of questions by audience members that I couldn't hear very well on the recording (including the first one), so I just included the gist of the question in the transcript.
