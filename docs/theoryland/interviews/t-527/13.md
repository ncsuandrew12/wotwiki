#### Question

Hi, I don't know if you're going to be able to answer this, but Matrim, Perrin, and Rand—the three of them, they've—they all kind of started out similar, they both have done way different things, they've both grow in really different and really interesting ways, but I was just wondering between the three of them, if you had a favorite one, or one you felt that's the most interesting?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Generally, I answer this question by explaining I have different favorites throughout the process of reading the books. When I started, Rand was my favorite because Rand was the main character, and Rand was awesome. Through the middle books, it generally became Perrin because Rand became...he became the Dragon Reborn. And he's cool, he's still awesome, but Perrin was more like me. And then...and then, Perrin got kind of broody, and Mat really became my favorite in the ending books. And I think you'll probably find that's common, I just followed...that's what a lot of the fans I found felt. I would say overall, most of the time, it's been Perrin. He's had the longest....Perrin, you know, he's Perrin.
