# [Interview #527: DragonCon 2010 Q&A Report - Marie Curie, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=527#3)

#### Question

Two books in, who would you say has become your favorite character to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can't really answer, because... I can answer for a given book, generally. Because I would definitely say that for
*The Gathering Storm*
Egwene was my favorite to write. And I've said that before.

#### Question

What about for
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

For
*Towers of Midnight*
...see, if I say it's glittery...

#### Audience

I think that's enough answer right there.
