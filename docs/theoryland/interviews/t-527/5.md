# [Interview #527: DragonCon 2010 Q&A Report - Marie Curie, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=527#5)

#### Richard Fife

This question has to do with a conversation I had with Wilson.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh okay, is this going to be? Okay, I think I know what this is going to be.

#### Richard Fife

At last JordanCon I was talking with Wilson, and he was telling me about the night that Robert Jordan told him the end of the book.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh huh.

#### Richard Fife

And he says that it started off with the word... they were talking about whatever, and it started off with Robert Jordan getting really quiet and then leaning in and saying, "There is a \_\_\_\_\_\_ in the Blight." To which that completely blindsides Wilson. He says, "There's a what?!?" And Robert Jordan then says, "There's a \_\_\_\_\_\_ in the Blight and not even Harriet knows about it." And then went on for two hours describing about how this was important and pivotal and yet takes place...be really important for the end of the book. Any further hints?

#### Brandon Sanderson

And see, Wilson can get away with stuff that I can't. And that is a story I've been told by three different people now. In fact, the first day I was there in Charleston, Harriet told it to me. Then Maria told it to me. And then I met Wilson later and he told it to me. Because that was the day when they suddenly said, "We need a tape recorder. Someone get a tape recorder." And I think Maria, like, went to the store to get one and came back with... But then, that was the session where he started for the first time dictating what was to happen and things like this. I do know that story. It's great for you to share it with everyone. I would not have shared that story because I have to be extra careful not to cross any lines. And so...you will get hints about whatever that was in the next book.
