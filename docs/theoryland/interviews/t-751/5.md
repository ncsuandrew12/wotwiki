#### Brandon Sanderson

He also did a reading from a new book he's putting together and that may become a TV series. About a genius kid who solves problems and is an incredible learner but is a bit insane. The way he learns is that every skill he leans like identifying writing styles becomes a new hallucination! And he is quite open about them being hallucinations! And some hallucinations are themselves crazy! So if he is asked to speak another language then HE can't! But the hallucination translates while he pronounces it badly. That's how Sanderson explained it.
