#### Sastan

In
*Lord of Chaos*
when Elenia told Rand that Morgase and Tigraine weren't cousins, Rand felt really relieved. Was it because he thought there was something wrong having a relationship with his second cousin?

#### Robert Jordan

Well he's not sure exactly how close his relationship to Elayne might be, how close his blood relationship might be. That's what he wanted to find out. He's in love with her and he'd really like to get it on with her but on the other end, he thinks he's gotta stay away from her to keep her safe. And on top of that, if she comes to stay, and god he might be related to her, and you know, how close is he? What is the relationship? He doesn't know. For all he knows there might be some way that he's as good as her brother. He's gotta find out. But he's gotta find out without letting anybody know why he wants to find out or even really that he is trying to find out.

#### Sastan

But if he finds, because Galad is his half brother and also Elayne's half brother, won't he find anything wrong with that?

#### Robert Jordan

No. The way the mother-father relationship works is different. He has a blood relationship to Galad. He has no blood relationship to Elayne. None. At least not close enough to be counted by anybody except by how many lines of connection you have to the family of Andor.

#### Sastan

The reason that Morgase got her throne was because she was the most closely related to Tigraine.

#### Robert Jordan

That's part of it. You gotta be closely related to put in a claim. After that it becomes political. In a way almost like... More like a republic than a democracy in that the electorate is limited. And in this case, the electorate is limited to the nobles. How many nobles can you get to support you. And she was able to get enough, finally, after something very close to a civil war to gain the throne.
