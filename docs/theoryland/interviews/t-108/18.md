#### Question

Do you know what the title of your next book is?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I won't until probably I'm close to the end. Sometimes it is the last bit of the book, something I've written in the last bit of the book. And a couple of times...
*A Crown of Swords*
. As soon as I knew I was able to put the Laurel Crown, Rand assuming the Laurel Crown in that book, I knew that that book was going to be called
*A Crown of Swords*
. But most of the time I'm at least halfway through it.
