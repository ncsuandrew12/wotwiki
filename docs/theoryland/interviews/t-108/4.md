# [Interview #108: Sydney Independent Theatre Q&A, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=108#4)

#### Question

On the subject of websites, there's quite a large discussion group within the newsgroups about some of your ideas and where they're going to go. Obviously you're not going to give away a lot there. One of the large points of discussion is Mat Cauthon's absence from
*The Path of Daggers*
.

#### Robert Jordan

I'd like to point out, you know... Boy, spoilers here. A certain thing happened to Mat in the previous book. If you've read it you know what I'm talking about. Something very subtle and very surprising and remember the thought, "What the hell happened to my luck?" or something like that. This book [
*The Path of Daggers*
] starts before that occurs. Now think about what happened to him and you might realize why he might want to rest up somewhere and have a few beers and just sit this one out.
