#### Question

Back on Mat again. Could you comment on whether or not he may be able to channel?

#### Robert Jordan

Nope. Not a chance. Can't do it. He can get anyone in the world to dance with him just about but he can't channel worth a darn note.

#### Question

He's still young enough for it not to show up, right?

#### Robert Jordan

No he's not going to be... He can't channel. But if you approach him the right way he will come to your birthday party on a Harley.
