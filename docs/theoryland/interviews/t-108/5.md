#### Question

I'm just wondering, for the Age of Legends, will you be following up or going back to that or maybe endorsing a movie on the Age of Legends?

#### Robert Jordan

No. I'm waiting for some contracts to catch up with me which are an option by NBC to do a mini series based on
*The Eye of the World*
with the screen writer who did NBC's
*Merlin*
. Now that's an option. It might happen, it might not happen. That's the only movie or TV activity going on. As far as the Age of Legends is concerned and going back to them, when I reach the last scene of this book I would have told the story that I wanted to tell in this world. I would have said what I wanted to say in this world. And my intention at that point is to go onto a different universe, a different world, a different set of rules, different cultures. I've been thinking about it for about five or six years now.

#### Question

With the same characters?

#### Robert Jordan

No, certainly not. If I've done it, why do it again? That's the trap that sometimes you guys push the writer into. You say, "You know, I really liked what you've done before. Do it again." And he does. And pretty soon he's doing the same thing over and over again. Now I'll hope you'll stick with me because I've done this. When I finish it I will have done it and I will try to go on something else that is not exactly the same. I hope you'll like it.

#### Question

Wouldn't be based around your physics by any chance?

#### Robert Jordan

Not in particular. Not to any greater degree than this is.
