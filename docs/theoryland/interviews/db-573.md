Hi everyone, it's been a while!

## Entry #2

#### Lord Mordeth

I was at this one too, asked Brandon as he signed my book who the old man in Natrin's Barrow in
*The Fires of Heaven*
was.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he knew but wanted to check and that I should email him about it, so I'll do that tomorrow and hopefully he'll fill us all in once he gets back from France.

#### Footnote
