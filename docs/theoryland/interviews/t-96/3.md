I was wondering/hoping that Jordan might go on a book signing tour. And if so, when and will it be in California?

#### Robert Jordan

Well....I've got good news and bad news. The good news is there is a tour...and I'm on it right now. The bad news is I was in California in the middle of October. Right after the book was published. All around San Diego, and LA, and San Francisco and Sacramento. Sorry.

#### Tijamilism

ACK!
