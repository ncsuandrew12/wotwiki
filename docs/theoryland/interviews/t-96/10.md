Do you have a set amount of books planned for the series and if so, how many?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I dont have a set amount of books planned. I believe it will take at least three more books to reach the ending that I have known for more than 15 years. I knew what I wanted to do in these books, what I wanted to say, and how it was all going to come out, before I ever started writing them.

Wow! 15 years!
