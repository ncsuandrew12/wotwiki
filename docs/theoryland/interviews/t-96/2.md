#### Talisein

When was the exact moment Mat would have been able to feel the dice in his head?

#### Robert Jordan

Tal, I'm not certain that I understand the question. There seems to be no context?

#### Talisein

We first have the dice rolling around in Mat's head while he's gambling in Tar Valon. Some seem to think that the dice are an after affect of handling the dagger from Shadar Logoth. So, I wanted to know if there was any credence to that idea ;)

#### Robert Jordan

Tal, read and find out....good question though.
