#### Talisein

You've said before that the reason Perrin wasn't in...that one book, excuse my ignorance, was because he wasn't doing anything of importance besides running the Two Rivers. I hope I don't spoil anyone present when I note that Mat was not in
*The Path of Daggers*
. Was this because he was doing nothing of note, or you simply wanted to make us cry? ;)

#### Robert Jordan

C'mon guys....Mat had half a building fall on him! Give the man a little rest! If he's alive, which I will neither confirm or deny (I could probably do very well in Washington!)....but you don't have half a building fall on you without a few ill effects!

#### Talisein

Hey, he IS
*ta'veren*
. The blocks could have formed a neat little cave around him.

#### Robert Jordan

That would be pushing the laws of coincidence, if you wish to call them that, a bit far. What a
*ta'veren*
does, remember, in effect, is unwittingly bend the laws of chance to favor himself, and to affect other lives. What would happen one time in a million without him there will happen because he IS there. But there really are limits.
