Let me thank Robert Jordan for being here this evening! I hope he can return even before his next book comes out!

RJ is gone and we were trying to type his final comments in but unfortunately the lag has confused things a bit. He basically said goodbye and thanked all for attending. And, good news! He's said he will visit again!
