RJâ€”I know after
*A Crown of Swords*
you said that you expected to go three more books to the end. After
*The Path of Daggers*
you said the same. Do you find that the story is becoming harder to write or that there is more info to write?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it's neither harder, nor is there more info...it simply has been that it is more difficult...no, not more difficult, it is still difficult to get to the end. Remember, after
*A Crown of Swords*
I said at least three more books....the same thing I say now. Because every time I reach a branching point and put down a major event, I cut off other possible paths to other major events. It means that certain things then are going to have to take place in a certain order and a certain way because the other branches of the logic tree are no longer available. But don't worry, guys, I really am getting there! I apologize for the length of time it's taking me, but I really am getting there.
