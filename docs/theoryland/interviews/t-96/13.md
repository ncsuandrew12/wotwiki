#### Slayer

I noticed how there are many similarities between the WOT and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Is this on purpose, or do great minds just think alike?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, it's not on purpose, though I don't know about great minds. Lord of the Rings has more dissimilarities than similarities to my series. I have no elves, no unicorns, no dragons. Tolkien wrote from a distinctly English viewpoint and voice about myths and legends that came from England. I write in an American voice, in fact a distinctly southern voice, about myths and legends that come from every country represented by the population of the US. And then there's the role played by women...there are only two women in Lord of the Rings....women tell half the story in WOT! There are other differences, and I sometimes find it hard to see the similarities.

#### Footnote

RJ stated in
[other interviews](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=5#12)
that he wrote the first part of
*The Eye of the World*
to be somewhat reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, as a sort of homage to Tolkien.
