#### Lisa\_SFF

Are you the one that sets the pace of the books being published, or is there a "plan" behind the timing of when they come out?

#### Robert Jordan

The books are published as fast as I can write them. In fact, in the beginning, you might say they were being published faster than I can write them! The normal lead time from ending a book to publication is eight months to a year. My last three books have been published within 60 days of completion by me.

#### Lisa\_SFF

Really? I've been reading them since they came out, and the "delay" between the next ones seems to get longer...or maybe I read faster now.

#### Robert Jordan

That's why we now are out on a longer stretch between the books. But I do hope that the next one will come a little bit faster.
