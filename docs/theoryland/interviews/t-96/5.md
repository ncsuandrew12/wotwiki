#### Tijamilism

I love all the similarities between Frank Herbert's Dune and WOT. Was this intended? If so, are you a fan of his?

#### Robert Jordan

No, there was no intention to make any similarities between Dune and my writings. And I am certainly a big fan of the original Dune novel. Although I doubt if I've read it since it first came out!
