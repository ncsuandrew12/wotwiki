Did you ever meet Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I saw him once at a convention but I didn't know him. I saw him as a fan and he wouldn't have known me from Adam. He asked his wife Harriet McDougal to find someone to finish the series and after he passed away, she went hunting. She considered it something of a dying request so she searched through a lot of fantasy authors. She hadn't heard of me, but she read my Mistborn series. She then called me up and asked me to do it. I didn't know I was being considered: it just came out of the blue. To be asked to finish the series was just astonishing and I wasn't expecting it. It was a little bit like winning the lottery when you haven't bought a ticket but someone you love has to pass away before you can win."
