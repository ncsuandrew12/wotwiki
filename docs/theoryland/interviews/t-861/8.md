# [Interview #861: SFX Interview: How Brandon Sanderson Ended The Wheel of Time, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=861#8)

#### Dave Golder

Is
*Memory of Light*
definitely the conclusion of The Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"There have been a lot of questions about this! Robert Jordan certainly wanted us to finish the series but we don't feel that he would have wanted us to write anything else after this. For all the desire of fans to want more, Robert Jordan—as far as I can see—did not want The Wheel Of Time to become a legacy series like Conan or Star Wars, where you have other authors working on stories. Robert Jordan didn't want that to be the vision for these books, so we're going to stop here. We're going to end on a high note and not continue it with any prequels or anything like that."
