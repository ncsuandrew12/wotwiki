Was this a big responsibility to take on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Oh, man, it's hard to explain what it was like because I started reading these books as a kid. I studied The Wheel of Time when I was trying to figure out how to write fantasy books in my twenties. So to be handed this project and be able to help finish the work of one of my heroes felt really good, but the weight of it was also like an enormous burden. I really wanted to make sure that I did a good job. Beyond that, there are millions of fans who all love the series so much and I felt a great debt to them. With my books, I own them so I going to tell my vision and I'm less worried about what the fan reaction will be. But with The Wheel Of Time books, I feel that they own them as much if not more than I do. I'm a steward of these books rather than the owner, so I had to keep that in mind and take a different approach."
