# [Interview #861: SFX Interview: How Brandon Sanderson Ended The Wheel of Time, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=861#6)

#### Dave Golder

One of the themes of the series is the cyclical nature of time so is it ironic that you've inherited The Wheel of Time after Robert Jordan's death?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm not unaware of how that relates to what's going on with me. One of the things that Robert Jordan did early on as an author was to work on the Conan books, so he was working on the stories of another author that had passed. Then he passes away and I ended up working on his story, so there was this cyclical thing going on there."
