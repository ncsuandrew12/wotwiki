# [Interview #861, Entry #1]: SFX Interview: How Brandon Sanderson Ended The Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=861#1)

#### Dave Golder

When Robert Jordan sadly passed away in 2007, the hunt was on for an author who could finish the epic The Wheel Of Time book series, which was so near to conclusion. It was Jordan's wife who chose Brandon Sanderson, best known for the Mistborn series, and no-one was more surprised by choice than Sanderson himself.

Sanderson ended up turning what Jordan had expected to be his final book into three books (he explains why below). Two have already been published—
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*The Towers Of Midnight*
. The third and final one—indeed the last ever book in the Wheel Of Time series—is out next Monday (8 January). So SFX had took the opportunity to have an exclusive chat with Sanderson on the eve of this momentous occasion.
