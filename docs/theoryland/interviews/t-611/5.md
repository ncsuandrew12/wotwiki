#### Brandon Sanderson

And now, back to work on
*A Memory of Light*
.

(Also, p.s., I've been invited to Comic-Con International in San Diego again this year, with a request that I appear on the fantasy panel. I wasn't intending to go, but with the invitation on the table, I decided it was worth the diversion. So if you're attending, plan on seeing me there. I'll bring some
*Alloy of Law*
goodies to give away.)
