The signing in Oslo was awesome. I loved the store, and the turn-out was great. Seriously, if you live in the area, you need to check out
[Outland Kirkegata](http://www.outland.no/section.cfm?path=1)
. They're the only bookstore that has ever flown me internationally on their own dime just so their readers could get some signatures. And, speaking of bookstores, I did sign some books in a few places, wherever I found them. So here's a list of places you'll find signed copies:
