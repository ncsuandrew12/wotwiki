For Mistborn fans, World of Warcraft is adding a "Survivor's Bag of Coins" to the 5.2.0 patch. See details
[here](http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94154-survivors-bag-of-coins)
. I think this is awesome! (Also note that the Mistborn action RPG
[*Mistborn: Birthright*](http://www.mistborngame.com/)
is still in development, but right now it looks like the release might get pushed back to 2014 instead of this year. There hasn't been an official announcement though.)
