# [Interview #887, Entry #7]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Photos & Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=887#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

My assistant has also uploaded two more Twitter archive posts. [Assistant Peter's note: The
[first one](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/119/Tweets-December-31-2012-January-9-2013)
is spoiler free, but there are plenty of spoilers for
*A Memory of Light*
in the
[second one](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/120/Tweets-January-9-13-2013)
. Brandon tries to keep spoilers out of his Twitter feed, but there are major spoilers in several of the questions that Brandon answered.]

We'll find out how
*A Memory of Light*
did on the
*New York Times*
bestseller list later today or tomorrow, but we already know it hit #1 on the Ingram and National Indie lists. (The
*USA Today*
listing above was for the week before the book came out.) We also made Shelf Awareness's Image of the Day for
[January 16th](http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=1907#m18660)
, which you can see here (taken at Joseph-Beth in Lexington):

Thanks for all of your support, and I hope you're enjoying the book! It has been an honor.
