# [Interview #381: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Release Week is here!, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=381#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

A lot of people have been emailing me, asking about the progress of the Copy Edit for
*Warbreaker*
. Many are curious at just what a copyedit is, and whether I've hit a rough spot on the Wheel of Time book since the progress has been so slow lately.

Don't worryâ€”work on
*A Memory of Light*
is going just fine. No rough points here! I just had to cut back for a few weeks to take care of other obligations. (I believe I warned you about them back in June.) I pushed very, very hard through August and early September on the Wheel of Time book because I knew that I needed to get ahead in order to have a chance of hitting my deadline by December. There were weeks when the percentage bar went up four or even five percent. Lately, it's gone up one percent. Remember, however, that my normal writing goal is 10k a week, and so cutting down to 5k these last few weeks hasn't been as big a stall as it might look. (It's just a big one in comparison to the 20k I was often doing the weeks before.)
