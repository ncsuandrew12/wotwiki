# [Interview #381: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Release Week is here!, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=381#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've already gotten some emails from people who have seen the book [
*Mistborn: The Hero of Ages*
] on bookstore shelves! (Bookstores aren't always that good at paying attention to when a book is supposed to be out, and will often put it on shelves when it arrives. That's just fine; I can't imagine how difficult it would be to keep track of when each and every book's specific on-sale date is.) From today on, all sales count toward the 'first week' sales of the novel, so if you can find a copy early, go for it! (The 'first week' ends on Saturday. So there's only officially five days in the release week to pick up a copy.)

I just sent out an email announcement to anyone who's emailed me through my website, so you might be getting one of those soon in your inbox. ;) In case you don't get one, the text is simple. Book Three is out on Tuesday! (Though the email is a lot more long winded.)
