# [Interview #381: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Release Week is here!, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=381#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyway, for you Wheel of Time readers waiting for me to turn full attention back to
*A Memory of Light*
, this copyedit is the last big thing that I had on my plate. I still have to do an
*Alcatraz*
3 copyedit in February or so, but it will be very short. I'm polishing off the last few bits of the
*Warbreaker*
copy edit now. The only question now—and it IS a big question—is how much I'll be able to work on
*A Memory of Light*
during book tour. I'm hoping to get back to 10k a week by writing in the car during Dave's turns driving or during points when I'm in the hotel waiting for a signing later in the night. We shall see! I'm going to give it my best shot.

As always, folks, thanks for reading! And please consider picking up a copy of
*Hero of Ages*
this week. ;)
