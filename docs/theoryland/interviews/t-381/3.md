# [Interview #381: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Release Week is here!, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=381#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

One of the big time eaters lately has been the
*Warbreaker*
Copy Edit. This is the last chance that I, as a writer, get to look at and change a manuscript before it goes to press. After this, the text is locked into place, and it's very difficult to make changes other than little proofreading tweaks. So I like to take my time on a copyedit and make sure everything is how I want it. I also take a lot of notes during this point for the Annotations, as this is generally my last time reading straight through a book.

The copyedit arrives in a loose leaf form, having already been to a copyeditor. Their job is to do very in-depth line edit, meaning they're not editing for story or character, but instead trying to make sure everything is consistent, properly formatted, and grammatically correct. One of the big things I have to do in a copy edit is approve or reject any changes made by the copyeditor. (Of course, there are rarely things to reject hereâ€”but occasionally you do something for stylistic purposes that might not be standard. For instance, in
*Warbreaker*
, I wanted to have Kalad's Phantoms capitalized, despite the fact that the copyeditor wanted to make the Phantoms lower case.)
