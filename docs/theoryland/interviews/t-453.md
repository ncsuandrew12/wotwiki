## [Entry #1](./t-453/1)

#### Matt Hatch

Was the taint influential in the creation/development/existence of the voice of Lews Therin in Rand's head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon answered that the taint was influential, but not the only factor. He referenced Semirhage, that of course we can't believe the Forsaken always, but yes, that the taint was an influence in the the voice. That we have to accept that in fact, in a way, Rand is going insane (as in as the books progress).

## [Entry #2](./t-453/2)

#### Matt Hatch

I asked, in essence, are One Power and True Power balefire the same?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He answered that the True Power is another source of power, that Aes Sedai were researching another source, like a different form of battery, to power their weaves and that for balefire, what it does is essentially the same between both power sources, but that it has different affects on the individual using the power source (this appeared to be a reference to what True Power does to its user).

## [Entry #3](./t-453/3)

#### Matt Hatch

WISH I HAD THESE ON TAPE, so I had the exact wording of question and answer...but I'm sure he'll answer them on the record again, because he believed he was on the record, but ustream was messed up at that moment.
