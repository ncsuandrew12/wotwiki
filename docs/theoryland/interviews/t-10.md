## [Entry #1](./t-10/1)

#### John Brannick

There have been some questions about Jordan's future projects lately and I thought I would pass along some information I got directly from Robert Jordan at a book signing last year.

## [Entry #2](./t-10/2)

#### John Brannick

Do you plan to write any more series about Hawkwing or the Age of Legends?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Readers will get all the information about those Ages that they need in the WoT books.

## [Entry #3](./t-10/3)

#### John Brannick

What will your next project be?

#### Robert Jordan

Not sure yet, but not a fantasyâ€”he doesn't want to be stereotyped by critics or fans. He has done research for a nonfiction history of the South's role in the American Revolutionary War.

#### Footnote

This is the only time RJ is on record saying that his next project wouldn't be fantasy. By the next year, he
[started talking](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#10)
about Infinity of Heaven.
