# [Interview #17: Letter to Carolyn F., Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=17#3)

#### Robert Jordan

I must say that I'm not surprised that most of your predictions didn't come out. I try to avoid doing what people expect. And I avoid answering questions, at least about what is happening in the books. If I answer some, people can begin to figure out some important things that I mean to hide simply by which I answer and which I don't. Whether you decide to go with publishing or illustration for a career—or both—good luck. Again, thanks for your letter.
