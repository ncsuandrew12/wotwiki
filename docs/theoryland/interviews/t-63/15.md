# [Interview #63: Reality Break Podcast, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=63#15)

#### Dave Slusher

Postscript: 2008

That was our 1994 interview with the late author Robert Jordan. He was the author of the Wheel of Time series, the most recent volume of which is
*Knife of Dreams*
. And the final volume of which,
*A Memory of Light*
, will be published in 2009, both from Tor Books.

Robert Jordan passed away in 2007 at the age of 58. He was far too young, and he is deeply missed.

Thanks for listening. I'm your host Dave Slusher. And I'll catch you again when we meet back here for the next Reality Break.
