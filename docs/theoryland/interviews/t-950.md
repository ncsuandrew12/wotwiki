## [Entry #1](./t-950/1)

#### Mageen

KJacobs: Yes, thanks for
[asking about Verin's letters](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=946#2)
! I was going to ask that directly to Brandon but you saved me some time. :)

I wound up asking two questions directly to Brandon, about Birgitte and Gaidal and about the Rand/Moridin body swap, which a friend requested I ask. I'll write them out as close to verbatim as I recall.

## [Entry #2](./t-950/2)

#### Mageen

I have a question about who Gaidal and Birgitte might be reborn as. I was wondering if Gaidal could be the son of an Asha'man and if Birgitte might be reborn as an Aiel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Gaidal definitely could be, and there's a pretty big hint in
*Towers of Midnight*
that many folks online have found. As for Birgitte, it's possible.

#### Mageen

Do you know who Birgitte is reborn as?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Mageen

I think a case could be made for Melaine, as the Wise Ones talk about her time being near.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the WoT, a soul becomes tied to the body at viability.

#### Mageen

(As noted in the group Q&A per Robert Jordan.)

I think that's pretty much confirmation that Gaidal is Grady's son. I can't decide whether the comment on viability is to direct attention towards Elayne, as she is at that stage of pregnancy, confirmed by that crazy scene. I know in the torchat Brandon said the notes don't say who Melaine's children are, so maybe he's just stating everything he knows. I prefer to think that Elayne's children might be Calian and Shivan and would usher in the end of the current age. I look forward to the encyclopedia, that's for sure!

## [Entry #3](./t-950/3)

#### Mageen

Can you shed any light on how the Rand/Elan body swap happened? I'm wondering whether it was like the Dark One's transmigration of souls, if it's tied to Rand's apparent new abilities, or something else.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not outlined in the notes, but I think of it as the soul that wanted to live found a body, and the one that wanted to die, did.

#### Mageen

I knew going in that Brandon has said RJ didn't explain how it happened, but a friend wanted me to ask and I'm glad I did! It was a much better answer than the shoulder shrug I expected based on the torchat.

Speaking of torchat, I noticed Brandon told someone that if they ask him on a tour stop, he might tell them who it was that helped Rand out of the cave. I'd be interested in knowing that and I would have asked that too if I'd remembered.
