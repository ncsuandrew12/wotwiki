#### Gary Singer

Could Lift convert food from other Cosmere worlds into Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Lift’s spiritweb has something changed about it to allow converting mass to Investiture directly.

#### Footnote

Based on Brandon’s answer, I'm not even sure she has to metabolize the food. It could be that she can burn anything she can swallow.
