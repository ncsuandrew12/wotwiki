# [Interview #562: TOM Signing Report - Chris Treco, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=562#4)

#### Chris Treco

We asked Brandon about his time working on the story, such as his greatest surprise from the last book,
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No one was surprised to hear that it was a certain scene involving Verin of the Brown Ajah, and while I won't go any further than that, I will add that he stated the scene in question was written entirely by Jordan before his passing.
