# [Interview #562, Entry #16]: TOM Signing Report - Chris Treco](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=562#16)

#### Question

Have you finished the
*Mistborn*
novella?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The
*Mistborn*
short story, that became a novella that became a short novel is 60,000 words long and is really looking like 70,000 words, which is about a third the length of one of my other novels. It's slow going while I'm on tour, but it will be done fairly soon.

#### Chris Treco

He had a few other details about this, but I'll let you watch the recording for the specifics. Also, read
*Mistborn*
if you haven't yet!

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you weren't aware, between books, I generally take a few months off and just write something random, whatever strikes me. I can't have a contract for it. It has to be something completely unexpected to keep instincts sharp and my writing ability sharp. I'm starting on
*A Memory of Light*
on January 1, but I've got these three months to do whatever occurs to me. Two months ago, I wrote a story about a pizza delivery man who turns into a necromancer. It was called "Death by Pizza". (lots of laughter; although I hope he publishes this!) He was a good pizza delivery man, with good pizza, he was just a necromancer.
