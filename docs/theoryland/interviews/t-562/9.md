# [Interview #562: TOM Signing Report - Chris Treco, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=562#9)

#### Chris Treco

Harriet finished to tumultuous applause, and Brandon reclaimed the microphone for the Q&A. What follows is a transcript of the audience's questions and Brandon's and Harriet's responses. For space, I cannot put every single word, but I will write out the responses as fully as possible. (Anything in parentheses is my own.) For more details, look for the film footage, which should hopefully be posted here as well.
