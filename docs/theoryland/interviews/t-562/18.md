#### Question

Who's your favorite villain to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the book. The scene that Harriet just read was a huge amount of fun to write, because Fain is just completely bonkers at this point. And so in this book I'd say that was, of the villain viewpoints, my favorite one to write.

#### Question

Can you do a Forsaken "Mwa-ha-ha"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

MWA ha ha ha HA HA HAH HA HA HA!!!
