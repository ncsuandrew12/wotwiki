# [Interview #562, Entry #14]: TOM Signing Report - Chris Treco](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=562#14)

#### Question

How are decisions made about breaking up the chapters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Usually, that's Harriet. I break the scenes, she decides what gets grouped together into a chapter, and she will often move the chapters around. She does quite a bit of that, tweaking it to try and figure out where the best balance is. I don't generally give her an initial (order) with a bunch of them. Well, she'll get them in viewpoint chunks first, and she'll be doing edits on those while I'm writing other viewpoint chunks, and then I'll stick them together in an initial, and she'll through and say, "No, this one needs to be here, and this one needs to be here, these three need to be one chapter." That sort of thing.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

And if Brandon says, "No, I just can't get behind this one," he wins! (Laughter from the crowd)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There were a couple that I really like. There's a really, really great cliffhanger at the end of the first Mat chapter and I'm like, "Oh, that's such a great place to break a chapter; it'll make everyone turn to the next page!"
