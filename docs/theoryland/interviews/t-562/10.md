# [Interview #562: TOM Signing Report - Chris Treco, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=562#10)

#### Question

I heard that
*The Great Hunt*
was written first, before
*The Eye of the World*
. Is this rumor or truth?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

It's rumor, not truth. He (Jordan, obviously) worked on
*The Eye of the World*
first; they came in order. He did work on
*The Eye of the World*
for four years before he ever gave me any of it. And, while he was writing
*The Great Hunt*
, he and I went out to lunch in the neighborhood deli, and he asked me what I thought the child-rearing practices of this desert people he had in mind, what they would be like. And if you remember, we just saw the first Aiel in a cage. But he was already working on how would Rand be brought up, you see, so he worked very far ahead in his thinking. But the way he wrote them was the way they were published.
