Your next novel,
*Warbreaker*
, comes out in June. What inspired it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wanted to tell a story in a world where color was the magic. I like the metaphor of color as life—when something dies the color fades, and that became a magic for color bringing things to life. I also liked the idea of a god who didn't believe in his own religion—somebody who was worshiped, but who did not accept that worship of himself.
