# [Interview #420: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#10)

#### Clayton Neuman

What do you have planned after you finish Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My next series will be
*The Way of Kings*
, which is the start of a big epic for me. I've plotted it as ten books. Fantasy writers, we get into this business because we love the big epics. We grow up reading Brooks and Jordan, and we get to the point where we say, "I want to do this myself."
