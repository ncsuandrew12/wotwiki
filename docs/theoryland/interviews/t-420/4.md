# [Interview #420: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#4)

#### Clayton Neuman

Did you struggle with any aspects of the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The biggest struggle was the sheer weight of characters. I was working on Perrin's viewpoint at one point, and Jordan's editorial assistant sent me this file filled with dozens and dozens of names of side characters for him that had not even appeared in the book yet. It's like juggling boulders, because there's so much weight to each of them.
