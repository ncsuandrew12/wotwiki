# [Interview #420: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#2)

#### Clayton Neuman

Were you ever reluctant to take on this project?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I spent a long time thinking, "Can anyone do this?" And my answer came out "No." But if someone else can try, I wanted it to be me. My goal has been to get the characters to feel like themselves when you read them. But it's like a different director directing the same actors and using the same script. You're going to end up with two different movies.
