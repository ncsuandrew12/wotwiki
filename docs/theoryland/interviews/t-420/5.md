# [Interview #420: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#5)

#### Clayton Neuman

Have you written the long-awaited Tarmon Gai'don (The Last Battle) scene yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's going to be the third book of the series. The first two books are about bringing all these plotlines that have spread out over 11 books back together. I'm working on the second third, so I'm at the point where you can spit across the line and hit Tarmon Gai'don, but I haven't actually written any of it yet.
