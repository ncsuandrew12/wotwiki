# [Interview #420, Entry #7]: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#7)

#### Clayton Neuman

What are the biggest questions you wanted answered by the end of the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was really curious about Moiraine and her plot line. Her disappearance was so open-ended. I wanted to see some meetings: Elayne and her mother, Tam and Rand, getting Perrin and Mat back together. I can't say whether or not that happens, but I was looking at them. In some cases there were opportunities and notes for it, and in other cases... I'm not going to force it. Jim did include in his notes what happened to Asmodean, and his widow made the call on where to put it in the book.
