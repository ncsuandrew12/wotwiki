# [Interview #420, Entry #6]: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#6)

#### Clayton Neuman

Robert Jordan was adamant that he was going to write only one more book in the series. Did you ever wonder what he was thinking?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughs] I have. I think that if he had been around, there's a chance he might have been able to get it into one book. But only because of his illness. If he would have had all the time he wanted, it would have been this long. It was always intended to be huge, but for me it was easier to write it piece-by-piece.
