# [Interview #420: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#8)

#### Clayton Neuman

Universal has optioned the series. Do you think it's possible to make a movie of this scope?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a difficult project. The people who are producing it seem very focused on the series, and they've put some of my worries to ease. It seems impossible, but I would have said the same thing about The Lord of the Rings. Impossible things can come to pass. Universal wants this to be a fantasy tentpole, and if that's really the case I can see them splitting books and giving this series the attention it deserves.
