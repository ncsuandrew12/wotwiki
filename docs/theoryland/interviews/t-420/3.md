# [Interview #420: AMC Filmcritic.com - Novelist Brandon Sanderson Discusses the End of the Wheel of Time, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=420#3)

#### Clayton Neuman

Did you have to change the way you write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't want to imitate Robert Jordan's styleâ€”I think that would turn into parody. But I needed to be more descriptive. The Wheel of Time books are lavish in their concrete sensory descriptions. And that's had a strong influence on my own writing: I just sent a couple of pages of something else to my editor, and he wrote back and said, "Wow, you've changed."
