#### Question

In which published book is Hoid the happiest ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is the happiest when he is getting away with something. Not in the Stormlight Archive because he is nervous about Odium being there. I think he is the happiest during the Wax and Wayne series, in bands of mourning maybe.
