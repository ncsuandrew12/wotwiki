# [Interview #1177, Entry #17]: La Dimension Fantastique](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1177#17)

#### Question

I wondered about Shallan's eidetic memory, and about the possibility of trapping a spren. Could a bonded spren be trapped inside a gemstone and trapped in a safe ? If so, would something else - not Investiture related - fill the "crack in the soul" ? Could that be linked to her memory or her need to draw before Lightweaving ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In and about, he answered that what Shallan does isn't out of the ordinary (which I'm not certain, she shouldn't have to draw before Surgebinding, as she has done before. And does again in Ch. 88. Maybe it is Ideal-based ?), and it is possible to trap a bonded spren inside a gemstone.
