#### Question

Question about the stormlight itself : a highstorm, full of stormlight, fills the spheres. Then, the KR use the stormlight or the stormlight evaporates with time. Question : where does the stormlight in highstorms come from ? Is there like a "rain cycle", but for the stormlight ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

the stormlight in the highstorm is transferred from the Spiritual realm through the Stormfather into the highstorm.
