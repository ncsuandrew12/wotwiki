# [Interview #663, Entry #1]: Melbourne Writers' Festival - Ali Kayn](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=663#1)

#### Robert Jordan

Author Robert Jordan visited Melbourne in September, 1999 for the Melbourne Writers Festival. He told us the festival was very like a science fiction convention, except that there aren't any hall costumes (fans dressed in costumes attending events and startling the natives in nearby streets).

This wasn't his first visit to Australia, he has been here before and seen Uluru, the rain forests and so on. This time he's off to Lizard Island, but we managed to catch a few moments with him to ask the usual questions.

#### Footnote

This entry was submitted on August 31, 1999, so it seems unlikely the event was in September (unless it's a matter of time zones). RJ is known to have been in Melbourne on August 27, and in Sydney on August 30. It's a short flight from there to Melbourne, so he might have gone back there after visiting Sydney.
