# [Interview #663, Entry #4]: Melbourne Writers' Festival - Ali Kayn](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=663#4)

#### Question

Has your interaction with fans, for example, at conventions, affected your work?

#### Robert Jordan

A good bit of fan mail comes in. I don't have people showing up at my home. If they did it would stop me writing.

#### QUESTION

Is there any particular incident (a letter, a meeting, a comment) that stands out?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

No. I've told them I am not going to write something because they want to see it, or not write something because they don't. It's going to be what I want to write.

I had a young woman call me a god. There was an 88 year old woman who wrote me a letter and asked me to "write fast".
