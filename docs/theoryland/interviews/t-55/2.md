# [Interview #55: Letter to Pam Korda, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=55#2)

#### Pam Korda

When Fades use their swords, we often see blue flashes when the Fade blade hits another weapon. Is this an interaction between the Fade blade and a specific sort of weapon (such as other Fade blades, or Aes Sedai-forged swords), or an interaction between the Fade blade and any iron, or is it just a special effect with no special basis?

#### Robert Jordan

The reaction is specific. The Fade's sword striking Power-wrought metal.

#### Pam Korda

(Since we've seen the sparks when two Fade blades meet, does this mean Fade blades are One Power-wrought?)
