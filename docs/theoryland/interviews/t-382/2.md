#### Brandon Sanderson

*A Memory of Light*
: I've had a couple of inquiries about the percentage bar here. I think I warned you way back in June that October would be a rough month for progress on the book, since it's hard to write when I'm on the road. But I'm still trying. Right now, I feel that I need to refresh my memory a little on the series, since I finished my read-through way back in March. So I'm re-reading
*Knife of Dreams*
at the moment. The progress bar doesn't reflect this, but I AM making motion through the book. I want to be careful to do the novel right. But I still anticipate being able to finish by the end of December. You may see the percentage bar tick up a few more points during the next few weeks of tour, but it's not going to go at the speed it did during August when I was pulling twelve and sixteen hour days writing because I knew that October was going to slow me down.
