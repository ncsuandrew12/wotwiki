# [Interview #348: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Back!, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=348#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I'm back from my trip to Charleston. We got some really good work done and I'm excited to get back to writing. Expect that percentage bar to go up a couple more points this week. Just so that you know, I've decided to use 400k as the wordcount basis for the progress bar. I'm still not sure how long the book will be—it could be longer than that, it could be shorter—but that seemed an appropriate base line. I'll be able to tell you more as the process continues.

Look for a
*Knife of Dreams*
blog post soon, as well as some regular updates. For now, a couple of links.
