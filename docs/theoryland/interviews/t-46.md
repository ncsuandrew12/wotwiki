#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 March 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46696862056587264)

And lo, 1% of
*A Memory of Light*
done, as per my website progress bar. My reading's been slow this last month, but I made up for it by working on a scene.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46700461159497728)

Here! A (kind of) screenshot of the beginning of the end of the Wheel of Time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46703346169556992)

For those asking: Yes, I write in courier. I apprenticed as a writer during an era where it was still the standard among the old guard.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46703697438314496)

I also underline instead of italicize, use "--" instead of an emdash, and have habits relating to other old-school typesetting artifacts.

#### [TROLLOC TALK](http://twitter.com/TrollocTalk/status/46675920702013441)

Will you hold a new charity contest for
*A Memory of Light*
, but this time for Trolloc/Dreadlord/Darkfriend names? We think you should.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46694903945764864)

I WILL hold a new contest like that. Likely to help fund Jordancon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 MARCH)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/47414995314679809)

People are asking about the files in the picture I posted on Saturday. The one that says "Alan Outline NEW" references Alan, RJ's assistant.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/47415214072803328)

Alan is a member of "Team Jordan" and was the one who compiled the original outline for
*A Memory of Light*
using all of the files and scenes RJ had.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/47415498043953152)

I have taken it and changed things around a lot, added to it, and it has evolved over the years. But it is the
*Memory of Light*
outline.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#2)

#### [Simon Dovey (16 March 2011)](http://twitter.com/sdovey80/status/48142139976196096)

Is March 2012 an accurate publishing date for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 March 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/48145530668326912)

I'm basically saying "Sometime in 2012." It will depend mostly on how long revisions take.

#### [Austin Moore (12 APRIL)](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/57920576060264448)

If book doesn't make March deadline, will it be April or would it be bumped back further for a better release period?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57938340338610176)

I honestly don't know. That's going to be Tom and Harriet's decision.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57938455686160384)

I just need to make sure I turn it in late this year sometime; from there, it could be launched any time 2012 they want.

#### Footnote

The release date ended up being pushed back first to November 2012 (announced at JordanCon 2011) and then to January 2013.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#3)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56437355447463936)

By the way, I AM still doing the #wotrr. Been a little too busy to tweet regularly these last few weeks. Will get back into it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56446056061341696)

For those following along, I'm right at the end of
*The Shadow Rising*
. Love this book. But man is it long. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56446162189815809)

Yes, I've still been writing on
*A Memory of Light*
at the same time. But I had to do the
*Alloy of Law*
copyedit last week, which slowed me a tad.

#### [LACOBUS](http://twitter.com/Lacobus/status/56454550239977472)

I started #wotrr same time as you and I'm just finishing
*The Path of Daggers*
! Sorry couldn't resist steaming ahead.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56456676525617152)

Ha. I'll catch up, maybe. I spend a lot of time making notes and building the outline.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#4)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57563364330704897)

Working on a scene that RJ wrote part of. In some ways, those are the toughest ones. Most time consuming, at least.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/57565058963734528)

How much do you usually have to change of RJ's scenes? Just the first part and the last so it fits in well or what?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57565270465720320)

Depends on the scene. If I'm lucky, it's what you explained. But getting my parts to match can be a LOT of work.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57565407317458944)

That's especially true if it's a new character, without a viewpoint narrative I can study except for the unfinished scene.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/BrandSanderson/~6AKfu)

Some of the scenes need more, as they are first drafts RJ intended to revise. I try not to change too much, but some of the scenes were ones where he was careful to lay down important things—like motivation—first, but didn't work on setting very much. (I'm working on one of those now.)

#### [DAVEJUSTDAVE](http://twitter.com/DaveJustDave/status/57563924798779392)

RE: reworking RJ's scenes. Ever get tired and goof? "As Rand reached for the Shardblade..er...
*Callandor*
"...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57565563454627841)

Ha. No, I haven't done that. Usually when writing WoT I make sure I'm very steeped in reading it at the time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 APRIL)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57918139811373056)

Scene I worked on yesterday is done.
*A Memory of Light*
is now at 2% done. (Assuming a 300k length, or about the length of
*The Gathering Storm*
.)

#### [DAVID WILSON](http://twitter.com/david2587/status/57928571414528002)

How fast do you expect the % to increase? I'm not badgering, just curious :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57938953365487616)

My goal is 2-3% a week while doing the reread. Then to step it up a bit from there.

#### [FELIX](http://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/57930911865520128)

On a more serious note, which book are up to your #wotrr project?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57939109976616960)

Book five. I've completed two scenes from
*A Memory of Light*
as well.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#5)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (27 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/63364836645535744)

WoT update: I've been doing more writing than reading lately, but keep running into walls. Tossed a few scenes. I'll work it out eventually.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#6)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 May 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/66266862140391424)

Note that I have a few percentage points to add to the progress bars on my website; we have to wait for the site to be fixed first, though.

#### [HERIDFAN](http://twitter.com/heridfan/status/66269710597103616)

Please do tell how many percentage points were added! Are you still doing #wotrr?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/66424901401186304)

Yes, but slowly, as I've gotten sucked into writing a few scenes. I'll bounce back and forth.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#7)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 May 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/70171687324360704)

Just wrote the wind scene for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [JIM NEWBERRY](http://twitter.com/kingnewbs/status/70173041195360256)

I knew you would ruin it! There are NO fart jokes in WoT, buddy!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/70174592802631681)

Lol.

#### [ESHAAN KOSHAL](http://twitter.com/eshaan_koshal/status/70173591920050176)

How long do we need to wait for the book? :D

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/70174525857337345)

Next year sometime.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/70174832838447104)

To those asking, I'm not going to tell you where the wind rose, folks. It's the very last of them. I can't spoil something like that.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/70207696615378944)

Slowly working through some things on
*A Memory of Light*
. There are some tough things I need to get right, though I can't say more.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (17 MAY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/70627176323629056)

Percentage meter on my website is still down. Just tried to update
*A Memory of Light*
and blanked things. We're at about 5%, though.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#8)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (24 May 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/73137554169397249)

Ahhhhh. International business. Plenty of room. This bodes well for writing. I finished a page or two of
*A Memory of Light*
on the previous flight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (27 MAY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/74007140477579264)

Just finished a scene in
*A Memory of Light*
that people have been waiting to read for a long, long time...

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#9)

#### [Wayne Strydom (2 June 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/Waywie01/status/76208370855587840)

Tweet us a line or two from
*A Memory of Light*
please guy????

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 June 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/76208888726298624)

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend... /trollface

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#10)

#### [Nicole Francis (3 June 2011)](http://twitter.com/inky_pen/status/76720277131771904)

Read three Mistborn books in three days. @BrandSanderson must have a magic pen.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (3 June 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/76737424302161920)

Unfortunately, that pen runs on the tortured screams of Wheel of Time readers waiting for their final book...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/76737773859639296)

Updated
*A Memory of Light*
finished status to 12%. Sitting in my hotel and writing after something like six media interviews in London today.

#### [AIDAN MCCLEAN](http://twitter.com/Aidan_McClean/status/76746625506217984)

Do we have an approximate date for publication? I need to start my re-read to get ready :-)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/76749480321490944)

Next year sometime. Latest: November. Earliest: March. More likely later than earlier.

#### [MATT MAYS (6 JULY)](http://twitter.com/spleen1015/status/88706897347219456)

Quick question :) What happened to
*A Memory of Light*
coming out this November? Your original post explaining the split says November.

#### [MATT Mays](http://twitter.com/spleen1015/status/88707051865391105)

I assume it was too much work and I am cool with that. I am just wondering. Did I miss a blog post explaining the change? Thanks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/88751691142406144)

There have been a couple of blog posts. Basically, it just wasn't feasible.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/88751779512205312)

Harriet asked for more time for editing; she was feeling rushed. I also needed more time.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#11)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 June 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/86513366725705728)

Just revised the percentage bar for
*A Memory of Light*
, bumping it up to 20% finished to reflect the work I've done in the last few weeks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/86659952155963392)

Back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. I can get in a few more hours tonight.

#### [KEVIN B. CARR](http://twitter.com/designspaceship/status/86660184969183232)

Please finish
*A Memory of Light*
and I'll buy
*The Way of Kings*
... Yeah, I'm late, so be it!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 JULY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/86662232557101056)

Ha. Consider that a deal. (Of course, I was going to finish
*A Memory of Light*
anyway...) :)

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#12)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/88692761322205184)

Working away at
*A Memory of Light*
. Doing a Rand viewpoint now. (Yes, to contrast
*Towers of Midnight*
, there will many of his direct viewpoints in this one.)

#### [ERIN KELLY (9 JULY)](http://twitter.com/LiterateKnits/status/89776176633085952)

The end of Wheel of Time is very imminent. Next year, if @BrandSanderson is to be believed (I trust him).

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89807577977856000)

Next year for sure. I'm getting close to the 1/3 mark done with the last book. It's moving well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89821507592798208)

Work on
*A Memory of Light*
should speed up from here out. I've done a lot of groundwork and outlining. Many scenes are all but finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89821724958400512)

I should be getting done about 1% a day from here out, though that's partially because I haven't yet counted some of that groundwork.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89822205231374336)

For now, I've updated the % bar on my website to 22%, reflecting the 66k words worth of chapters solidly and completely finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89842631529603072)

"Men thought violence could solve anything. If she'd had a stout stick, she'd have thumped all three until they saw reason."—Nynaeve

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89842631529603072)

(Note: that quote is edited for size.) Yes, I'm back to my #wotrr, now that outlining on
*A Memory of Light*
is done, though my focus is still on writing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89844872164548608)

I now have over 20k of you jokers following me on Twitter. Wonder what % came hoping to see me post a line from
*A Memory of Light*
by accident.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#13)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90538195334344706)

Today, I've been working on the tactics for the Last Battle, looking to make them as authentic as possible. A lot to keep in mind here.

#### [CHRIS EDWARDS](http://twitter.com/toph303/status/90514661836980224)

Do you have a tentative time frame for when
*A Memory of Light*
will be out? Trying to figure out when to start my re-read.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90538362754183168)

Sometime next year. Hard to say specifically; depends on how long Harriet takes to edit.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90538478923812864)

Enough people are asking that I'll go over the
*A Memory of Light*
release timeline again here for you.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90539048099254273)

Goal: Turn in in the first draft November 8th. Following that, editing and revisions. Those are the uncertain part. 3-6 months are likely.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90539284595085312)

So, best case for the book out is March. Worst case is November next year. (Harriet has asked Tor for more time to edit this time.)

#### [LOUISE LEWIS (12 JULY)](http://twitter.com/mcfange/status/90854702790606848)

Didn't I read somewhere that Robert Jordan already wrote the last chapter?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90866687913639937)

He did. It's great.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#14)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91280199139852289)

*A Memory of Light*
First Draft progress bar update. 22% -> 24% One quarter is around the corner.

#### [SPEARSISTER](http://twitter.com/spearsister_/status/91288429790363648)

Are there any notes released to the public concerning
*A Memory of Light*
? Please, I hope you get time to write back.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91352374941200385)

By notes, you mean Mr. Jordan's notes? We might release some of them after the book is out. Harriet's call.

#### [MARTIN GJESDAL (15 JULY)](http://twitter.com/mgjesdal/status/91923738282565633)

Is March 2012 still a realistic release date for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91943972204851200)

Very. It will happen almost certainly.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91969564455342080)

Oops. I didn't see the "March" before that. 2012 is certain. March not certain yet.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91969685926576128)

March is probably the earliest it could be out. Latest would be November. It will be Tor and Harriet's call.

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#15)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (18 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/93066251525566464)

Man, @MaryRobinette's travel karma must have rubbed off on me. Delayed here TOO. Guess I'll work on your book in the airport, WoTfans.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#16)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (22 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/94507215020498944)

Just updated the % bar on
*A Memory of Light*
from 24% to 27% to reflect this week's work so far. A lot of travel this week, with ComicCon, slowed me down.

#### [JORDAN BRADFORD](http://twitter.com/LordPachelbel/status/94462151946801152)

Just got
*Elantris*
and
*Warbreaker*
at Waldenbooks' liquidation.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/94507926131195904)

Sweet. Nice score. I once got all of King's Black Tower at a similar deal.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/94529446232604672)

Ha. Just looked at my last tweet, which was a direct reply to someone, and realized a mistake I made. Gives a clue what I'm working on...

#### Footnote

King's series is called "The Dark Tower".

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#17)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95626923769724928)

By the way,
*A Memory of Light*
% done has moved from 27% -> 30%. Expect sharp rises this week; I hit a patch where I've already done a lot of work.

#### [WERTHEAD](http://twitter.com/Werthead/status/95633835819147265)

Final WHEEL OF TIME novel approaching a third-done? Impressive. Probably too much to hope we'll get it earlier than Nov 12?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95668778569969664)

It's really going to depend on Harriet, Adam. My goal is to turn it in before I go on tour November.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95668990109683713)

From there, we'll go to revisions. Harriet has asked for more time to edit this one. (She worries the last had too many mistakes.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (26 JULY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95939459169796096)

I love working on Perrin's scenes. I can't really explain why, but the two of us have always clicked.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95983762822807552)

6k words of material for
*A Memory of Light*
(some worked on previously) added to the main storyline. 2% more done, bringing us to 32%.

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#18)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/96672517909004288)

There is a LOT of warfare/action in this book. I know that should be expected, but I thought I'd warn you anyway...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/96715183346565120)

Two more % added to the bar for today and yesterday's work.
*A Memory of Light*
is now 34% done, so we've passed the 1/3 mark.

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#19)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (1 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98169715540766720)

Moving
*A Memory of Light*
's progress bar up 2% to 36%. Expect it to move a tad more slowly this week than last. This patch has less work done on it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (2 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98594114890760192)

I wonder if it would be too spoilery to post a running count of significant named WoT characters who have died so far in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98596027929595904)

Granted, that count might be 0 so far, so no spoilers yet. I'm just saying... It could be fun to start a count.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98597654484885504)

(Note, I'm not going to do it. Too spoilery. Just trying to think of things to tweet about the books, as there's so little I can say.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98600156802453505)

How about a non-spoilery Easter egg instead? Each of the three prologues has had at least one complete scene written by RJ before he died.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98600424155779072)

When I split the books, I split the prologue in a way that at least one of those scenes went into each book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98600594079617024)

Prologues were important to RJ, particularly in the later books, and I wanted his stamp to be on each one of the three prologues.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/98600946891886594)

The scene with the Borderland towers in
*Towers of Midnight*
prologue was all RJ correct?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98601448144773120)

Yes. I've confirmed that before. Good eye, if you spotted it on your own.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#20)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (3 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98845542016221184)

I'm currently writing "Through Lines" on
*A Memory of Light*
, meaning I'm taking one character or group and going beginning to end.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98845983827443712)

I'll end up writing the ending a number of times through different eyes, each separated by a short book's number of pages. Odd experience.

#### [CHRISTOPHER SKINNER](http://twitter.com/MaverickTempest/status/98846355631517696)

How do you do that without diminishing the impact of the "big finish" (I mean there's denouement anyway, but the climax)?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98848107529375744)

Careful planning, followed by a lot of reads-through of the entire book to smooth and enhance.

#### [NEIL MCKINNON](http://twitter.com/mc_neeze/status/98848358889816065)

Did you do that with Rand/Egwene in
*The Gathering Storm*
and Mat/Perrin
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98849087780171776)

Yes, I did.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98862718035038208)

At about 20 scenes and 50k words, the first "Through Line" of
*A Memory of Light*
is done. I can't tell you who it is, but I'm very pleased.

#### [ERIC PETERS](http://twitter.com/ericpeters/status/98863975541907457)

Why wouldn't you be able to tell us who it is? Is it a real secret who all of the characters in the book are at this point?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98865440914276352)

Some people don't want any kind of spoiler. Knowing there are 50k words of someone means they don't die at the start.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98866710727245824)

If you look back through my Twitter feed, you can figure out who it is. [It was Perrin.] I might do a blog post on it too, with a spoiler warning.

#### [SHARON VERNON](http://twitter.com/rgoddes/status/98849712920215552)

Do you find it easier to write "through lines" and then tie it all up together later?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98863061833760768)

For a very big, complex book, it's basically the only way I can do it. Otherwise, I lose character voices.

#### [FRANK KWIATOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/98954093627838464)

Is this your style, or how RJ wanted it? Just curious.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (4 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007615199232000)

What specifically are you asking about? The writing of "Through Lines?"

#### [FRANK KWIATOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/99019813166383104)

You mentioned writing the same ending multiple times. I'm taking it as the same ending being reviewed from different POVs?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99033092131536896)

Different pieces of what, together, will be the ending sequences of the book.

#### [CONNOR EVERINGHAM](http://twitter.com/Connor_e/status/98921317084049408)

I'm guessing that with one through line at 50k words,
*A Memory of Light*
will be a massive book?Will chunks be taken out during editing?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007811958222848)

I always edit down, rather than up. I overwrite intentionally on first drafts. But the book will be big.

#### [PHIL](http://twitter.com/e_chemyst/status/98915868834140160)

I might just be ignorant here, but what's a "Through Line"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007995018620929)

Where you write one character's parts, all the way through the book.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#21)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007299888226304)

Still working on
*A Memory of Light*
. That deadline (which is self-imposed, but still important to me) of November is starting to loom.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99009639601016833)

Blarg. This scene is just way too bland for the level of awesomeness it is supposed to include. Scrapping it.

#### [JD](http://twitter.com/johnjosephTX/status/99030331931365376)

How many words did you scrap? And how much time was invested?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99032717865385984)

Maybe three hours worth of writing. Not that much. 1500 words, perhaps?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99038895076937728)

New scene has more kick to it, I'm pleased to report.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (5 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99596325204656128)

One more short scene just added to the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue. It needs one more, but I haven't decided which one yet.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#22)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/101768478335320064)

I moved the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up one more point, to 38%. Slow going this week. Head cold + lots of pre-writing to do + sister's wedding.

#### [Jay](http://twitter.com/Congo_Red_Jr/status/101769104851087360)

Will
*A Memory of Light*
actually be the last book? or do you think you will split it up again? Are you thinking of 2012 release?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/101770127732785152)

It will not be split. I'm pretty certain. 2012 for sure.

#### [Greg Lindsey](http://twitter.com/glindsey212/status/101786843946819585)

Hi Brandon! Any guesstimations on when we might see
*A Memory of Light*
cover art? Thanks!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/101788932995432448)

I was just asking Tor about this, actually. I think it's a little ways off. Maybe first of next year.

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#23)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103566081611927552)

Working on a big climactic scene. Was going to tweet that, then realized, pretty much all of them in this book fit that description...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/103566685461692416)

That's good to know. It makes more sense than something like
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
with long stretches of not-much-happening.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/103567934017900544)

In other words, I think it will reassure the fans who doubt you can pull it off in just one more book. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103569654630453250)

Yeah, it's really going to be one. I'm 125k or so in, and it feels right. I'll get it all in.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103613569853161473)

I'm moving the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up 2%, to 40%. Should easily hit 50% by the end of the month.

#### [RICK WATSON](http://twitter.com/greigmeister/status/103642285622829056)

How's the chances of a release in the spring looking in your opinion?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103650384190521344)

So so. I'll be straight with you; it would be a LOT of work to get it out then. Possible, we've done it that fast before.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103650497990377473)

However, that was when we were trying to hit the holiday season, and it resulted in a book with typos and mistakes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103650558581280768)

My guess right now is that neither Tor nor Harriet will want to push for that.

#### [CHRIS EDWARDS](http://twitter.com/toph303/status/103634775679569920)

Can't wait, been WoT fan for years. You have a different style, but I can deal. I'm going to start reading your other work.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103652467824263168)

Thank you. I understand the style is different, and I hope it's not too distracting.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103613569853161473)

Shed any tears yet writing any particular scenes? ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103652743683645442)

There have been a few tough ones.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#24)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106070560487911424)

Okay, back from WorldCon and (mostly) recovered. Back to work on
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106123521532493824)

Blarg. This chapter and viewpoint isn't working. Going to try Thom for a bit instead. Need to be inspired by a storyteller.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/106132823013998592)

So are you saying Thom is still alive? Good to know:)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106137084439441408)

Well, he starts the book alive. I'll say that. Who knows where in the book this scene will go?

#### [JOSIAH DAVID REPP](http://twitter.com/daJozenOne/status/106124553989799936)

How far through writing that book are you?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106133068456280064)

40%

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#25)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (24 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106492106050240512)

Update on that scene that wasn't working in
*A Memory of Light*
yesterday: tried it again today and it worked just fine.

#### [THOMAS LACHESIS](http://twitter.com/thsnrrwlmts/status/106493689664258048)

Did you try a new way in to the scene? Or, was it simply stepping away from it?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106494026496225280)

Stepping away from it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/106493973765427200)

Moving
*A Memory of Light*
completion bar from 40% -> 43%. Assuming the rest of the week works as well as today did, it will move quickly for a while.

## [Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#26)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108433003553898496)

Writing
*A Memory of Light*
makes me tired. There are a lot of exhausted people in this novel.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/108793647289483264)

Have you seen this
*A Memory of Light*
fan art of the
*ta'veren*
? It's fickan awesome.
<http://tinyurl.com/4qtxjus>

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108811020012765184)

I've seen it, and I do like it a lot.

## [Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#27)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (31 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108816705609932800)

Dang. I just pulled off something in
*A Memory of Light*
that is GRRM-esque. I'm not certain if I should apologize, feel awesome, or go take a shower.

#### [SARAH WALTERS](http://twitter.com/Xaraxia/status/108817594420695040)

Haven't read GRRM, should I? Also, I recommend feeling awesome and writing more of
*A Memory of Light*
, but I'm biased.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108818534691385344)

Depends on your threshold for content. His writing is genius, but he is very brutal. I could only stomach the first one.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108818614672572416)

His short stories are awesome, by the way. I've liked every one of those I've read.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108820084524457984)

Also, the Minas Tirith theme is playing on Pandora. Perfect.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/108824272935452673)

Gah, now you've got me thinking Boromir/Gawyn.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

I have no idea if Brandon saw that tweet, but his next one came after it, for what it's worth. Some
[more info](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=622#8)
was given on this in the reddit Q&A, and there might be another clue
[here](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=638#2)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108826819414863872)

Some good mythological underpinnings and references in this scene, as I believe RJ would have done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108827773128282112)

If I ever get to write the annotations for this book as I plan, this scene will be a nice one to talk about.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108828101785554944)

One of the challenges in writing these books is to get mythology right. Not too overt, with careful references. RJ left help, fortunately.

#### [JOHANN THORSSON](http://twitter.com/johannthors/status/108832211465289728)

You mean like Rand having a wound in his side, a la Jesus on the cross?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108835403410317312)

That's one of very, very many. But yes. And, you know, Rand being a sheepherder...

#### [SIMEN ISAK DITLEFSEN](http://twitter.com/SimenIsak/status/108827621575503873)

RJ used a lot of mythological inspiration. But I haven't seen a lot of Greek myths used. Have you?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108828320833081344)

It's there. Look where Perrin gets wounded.

#### [SIMEN ISAK DITLEFSEN](http://twitter.com/SimenIsak/status/108831882279534592)

ahh... The Achilles arrow?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108836083835469824)

Look up blacksmith gods. Hephaestus, Wayland. And, you know, Perun...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108828526668550144)

But I felt RJ thought Greek/Roman was overdone, so stayed away from using it as much as Norse/Celtic/Native American.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108834267743797248)

Okay, signing off for the night. I need to be up for my Q&A on reddit come noon my time. (I'll tweet a reminder.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108834445812965377)

Moved the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up to 48% complete to reflect work done so far this week. Been a good week.

#### [ELVAN](http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/aliciadominica/~Rciyq)

I believe you are trying to kill us by triggering extreme amounts of anticipation and excitement. Some of us don't have the heart to take it you know. Seriously though, can't wait.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108830451048783872)

Ha. Just trying to keep everyone involved, if only in a small way. ;)

#### [Jerron Spencer (31 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/joescreenwriter/status/108831586480427009)

Is the long wait for
*A Memory of Light*
so it can make more sense than
*Towers of Midnight*
? I LOVE WoT, but
*Towers of Midnight*
was jumbled and super annoying.

#### [JERRON SPENCER](http://twitter.com/joescreenwriter/status/108832347918573568)

I don't mean to sound the jerk, but character and time references felt disjointed and it was hard to follow.

#### [JERRON SPENCER](http://twitter.com/joescreenwriter/status/108832969329868800)

*The Gathering Storm*
worked well. I never felt confused or bothered. Some revelations came off as "too sudden", but it flowed nicely.

#### [JERRON SPENCER](http://twitter.com/joescreenwriter/status/108833625662963712)

*Towers of Midnight*
had none of the smoothness of the previous books, and stumbled from poor integration with
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (31 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108834738055286784)

What you're noticing has to do with two primary issues, I believe.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108834905030533120)

First, the book getting split in half after I'd written much of it to go together. (I hadn't written any of the third then.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108835062883168256)

Second, RJ had been letting people get off timeline with one another for books and books. Bringing them back together was hard.

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#29)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (1 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/109373792597442560)

That's another "Through Line" on
*A Memory of Light*
finished. Now, back to the middle of the book to write forward on another character.

#### [CRAIG FOSTER](http://twitter.com/TheAggroKrag/status/109374787989671936)

So writing
*A Memory of Light*
is more like building a giant Dagwood sandwich than it is like baking a birthday cake?

#### [CRAIG FOSTER](http://twitter.com/TheAggroKrag/status/109375309253578752)

...in that you're taking finished products and making them fit together as opposed to mixing it altogether start to finish...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/109380300861210624)

That's it.

#### [GARETH BARTON](http://twitter.com/Gibberalic/status/109407219845566464)

Question... Do you write each character in one go? The full story for that person, then splice it in with the others?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/109416681587220480)

I often do, if they are in different places. If together, I write them together.

#### [Austin Moore (5 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/Southpaw2014/status/110837446228455424)

Is
*A Memory of Light*
still on par to being around the length of
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/110844153054756864)

Yes.

## [Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#31)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (7 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/111555172190273536)

Sometimes, it feels like cheating to have Alan and Maria (Robert Jordan's assistants) to look things up for me on these books.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/111555393397862401)

For example, Alan is a military history buff, and has been my personal "Great Captain" for
*A Memory of Light*
, giving valuable advice on tactics.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/111572758340710401)

Finished a really awesome scene today, and started one that turned out meh. I'll have to rework that one come this evening.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/111573341768392704)

Not counting that scene, but counting the awesome one,
*A Memory of Light*
is at 52% done now.

#### [JOHN UNDERWOOD](http://twitter.com/Zod1966/status/111617923386327040)

52%? That's great! I'm wondering though how did you come up with that number?

#### [JOHN UNDERWOOD](http://twitter.com/Zod1966/status/111618002260197376)

Do you have a specific number of pages in mind to finish the book?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/111632646634868736)

I've used 300k words as a rough estimate for each of these books for getting the % bar.

## [Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#32)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112627777064280064)

Finished another "Through Line" of
*A Memory of Light*
. This one turned out really, really well. I'm kind of surprised, honestly.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112628078953496576)

This is a character I think many readers are less excited about, but the story here is very powerful. I'm pleased.

#### [HARSH AGARWAL](http://twitter.com/H4R5Hagarwal/status/112616727841484800)

When can we expect the last book to be released?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112628269119062017)

Next year sometime. Spring at the earliest (I don't think it's likely) fall at the latest.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112629726320922624)

Nice big jump in the progress bar today as I pull a few things I'd already been working on and place them in the book. 52% -> 56%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112630188612911105)

For those curious, I've been timing lately and looking at my historical wordcounts (I often keep lists of daily progress.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112630457107095552)

Writing a given amount of words on the Wheel of Time takes about twice as long as it does when working on non-WoT books.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112630743808737280)

I think this is due to: 1) The complexity of working in such a long series. 2) Making sure character voices match those in RJ's writing.

#### [TERRY SIMPSON](http://twitter.com/TeeSimps/status/112631869182443520)

Which character voice have you found it hardest to duplicate? And has that difficulty stayed consistent for each book?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112637452073701376)

Mat. Yes, he has always been the toughest.

#### [CAITLIN GRANT](http://twitter.com/CGrant4/status/112644143318183936)

Love knowing progress but just remembered Tor will likely delay e-release. #frustration

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112647481149505536)

Not Tor, actually. Harriet. I'm working on her, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112647606697603072)

The delay last time was because
*The New York Times*
didn't count ebook sales for bestseller lists.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112647957337223168)

A lot of people are asking about the release date for
*A Memory of Light*
, so I'll talk about it again. I just couldn't get it out for this November.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112648292525023232)

My new rough-draft goal is November, with a revised book sent to Harriet January 1st. Book could be out any time between March (unlikely) and November.

#### [OSKAR KOIVUJUURI](http://twitter.com/OskarKAwesome/status/112648793429778433)

This November? I thought it was always supposed to be released March of next year? Oh well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112649755741523968)

I was hoping March. It's theoretically possible...but Harriet thinks not. She wants more time to edit than she had for
*Towers of Midnight*
.

## [Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#33)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/113309945151229952)

I have three more major 'Through Lines' for this book, then some spot fill-ins of smaller characters. After that, some work on the climax.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/113310237552934913)

The ending will actually be the easiest part of this book for me, as RJ wrote large chunks of it himself.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/113310647495819264)

So while it may look like I'm not far enough along to be finished in November, the last 10% or so will jump forward very quickly.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/113326795784331264)

But you
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#4)
those were the most time-consuming parts for you. :s

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/113394011313680384)

Scenes he half finished are very tough. Scenes he totally finished are easy.

#### [GRAE WOLFFE](http://twitter.com/grae42/status/113335517516541952)

This is the final edit before going to print then? Or one more go-through after this?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/113397274859679745)

This is just the first draft, I'm afraid.

## [Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#34)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 October 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/129999952859496448)

I find myself thinking "It's been forever since I wrote Perrin. I'll be glad to get back to him." Then I realize his sequence is done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/130000989435596800)

Note that this isn't because Perrin isn't in the book much. (He is.) It's because I wrote his chapters first.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/130001662709469184)

It is odd, knowing that some characters have had their stories told, that no more will be written about them. You'll feel this next year.

## [Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#35)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/115199042941751297)

Sorry for the lack of updates and replies on Facebook/Twitter lately, folks. Been working hard on your book. Seven weeks until my deadline...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/115199309464604672)

Granted, that's a deadline I set for myself, so it can move if I feel it needs to. I'd still like to hit it.
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar moved to 61%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/115264453641109504)

Some are asking how I get guess the % finished of a book not done. I've been using 300k words as a guess. (As I did for
*Towers of Midnight*
.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/115264655911436288)

Since
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
were both around 300k, and they got me 2/3 through the outline, I think it's a pretty good estimate.

## [Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#36)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/116421150262837248)

Sigh. Some good scenes getting done despite some distractions over the last few days, but...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/116421459060080640)

...Egwene's through line keeps adding chapters. I've tried to write the last one of this sequence three times, and split it each time.

## [Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#37)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (22 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/116951894840180736)

Pandora's playing a LDS children's song: 1) This does NOT fit the Last Battle. 2) How's it know I'm Mormon? It's a Tangerine Dream station.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/116952971903905793)

It's now playing Michael Buble. Somewhere in my thumbs-upping, I may have deviated from the station's electronica theme just a tad...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/116954647993909248)

I'm going to inject Pink Floyd into the station to shake it up. By the way, I listened to Pulse again this week. Man, that album is awesome.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/116966196028522496)

Some of the most fun I get to have comes when Mat describes someone in his head. (Can't match RJ at doing so, but it's still fun.)

## [Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#38)

#### [Austin Moore (23 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/117308725886328832)

You recently said you were just over 60% finished with
*A Memory of Light*
; how much % will RJ's ending take up when you put it in?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/117314077977616384)

I'm guessing about 10%.

#### [Austin Moore](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/117319043039498242)

Is it gonna get slid right in or are you going to adjust it some to fit into how you're leading up to it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/117320851791151104)

The ending scene will work fine, no changes. I've targeted things that way, as I didn't want the ending scene to change.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/117321007764750336)

However, he left a TON of 'after the end scene' type stuff that is probably epilogue material. That I'll need to modify.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (26 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/118436057699192832)

*A Memory of Light*
progress bar moved from 61% to 66%. Sorry about the lack of movement last week. I forgot to tick up the progress bar.

## [Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#40)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/119149079283515392)

An important moment in
*A Memory of Light*
centers on one character turning to another and asking, "How much do you trust Mat Cauthon?" How much indeed.

## [Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#41)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119879076805750784)

FINALLY done with the through line I've been working on for weeks now. Progress bar moved to 70% done.

#### [SRINATH UPADHYAYULA](http://twitter.com/USrinath49/status/119882447847571456)

When can we expect it??? What do you think?? #reallyreallycan'twait!!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119892881136828416)

Sometime next year. I suspect they'll set a date when I give them the first draft in November.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119894890170683392)

Now, to fire a
[gun that has been sitting on the mantle](http://t.co/OmaV8PAQ)

Now THAT is a good clue. (The Mat one was not incredibly surprising, but this one will be fun.)

Pfft, we've barely started yet.

#### [BEN KLUGE](http://twitter.com/benkluge/status/119905482642173952)

I know—but once we have got started the odds of possibly getting an answer drop from very low to zero.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119906702400290816)

Ha. I already flirt with giving away too much. I doubt you'll pull anything more from me for a while.

#### [4TH AGE](http://twitter.com/4thAge/status/119906698793201664)

I'm sure with how conscious you are of us examining your every word you checked, so are you SURE it's in those chapters?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119908557138300928)

99% sure.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119959569144360961)

Would you at least confirm you're not talking about 13-13? You referenced that as a Chekhov's Gun before
*Towers of Midnight*
...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119959691118915584)

...and so the association is hard to shake. But it was introduced in
*The Dragon Reborn*
22 and of course already showed up in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119959900897021952)

And technically, you
*could*
be referring to that since we didn't actually see the turning. And 99%. :( ... ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (5 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121472468404809728)

Mat is so much fun to write. The trick, which is hard, is to get the right mix of humor & awesome. One without the other just isn't Mat.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/121476468579647488)

Ahh, confirmation. And good luck with Mat. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121479165122842624)

Not sure what I'm confirming, but okay. On the thing I tweeted before, it's obviously NOT 13x13. It is cool, but smaller than that.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/121480083121778688)

Cool. I was talking about the fact that you were working on Mat's 'through line'. I had assumed you were. Smaller? Hmm.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

In retrospect I'm not so sure he was working on Mat's through line because in the previous one, he specified he was writing Mat's thoughts.

?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 October 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121334155580682241)

They'll chose one when I finish the rough draft, I believe. Should be a big announcement in November.

Well, THAT was a scene people have been waiting to read for many books. You know, it's very hard to talk about
*A Memory of Light*
without spoilers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/122078742976790528)

Let's see...what can I say without spoilers? This involves two near-deaths in a scene where most wouldn't expect any. #AesSedaivagueness

#### [MICHAEL ZODDA](http://twitter.com/wordsbyzodda/status/122084536589889536)

The Return of Narg!

Yes, @wordsbyzodda. It's obviously the return of Narg that I'm talking about. The Dark One transmigrated him into a sheep.

*A Memory of Light*
progress bar moved to 75%. This puts it at 225k words so far, roughly the size of book eight. (Using 300k as a guess for the final.)

#### [ERIC PETERS](http://twitter.com/ericpeters/status/122081277670211584)

One of the interviews mentioned the last book getting split up into two books, did you still think 300k words is a good number?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/122083557526081536)

Yes, it's a good number. The book will run longer (mine always do) but it will be roughly that length. 400k at the upper end.

Interesting. Orbit's new 'Turn the Wheel of Time' promo thing seems adamant that
*A Memory of Light*
will be November 2012.

#### [WERTHEAD](http://twitter.com/Werthead/status/123872592141615104)

I thought that was still up in the air and an earlier release was possible (especially if @BrandSanderson delivers by Jan 2012).

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 October 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123883544215957505)

The date hasn't been picked yet, so theoretically anything next year is possible.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123883667167780865)

However, realistically, I doubt Tor will pass up the holiday season for the last WoT book. Or at least the summer season.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123883830988898304)

While they COULD pick spring, it wouldn't make much sense marketing wise, and I think Harriet wants a good six months to edit.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123883961725362176)

That means July is the earliest, November the latest, we will see the book. I'd put my money on somewhere in-between.

How many drafts do you normally write for an epic novel like

? Just curious as to how long the process takes.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 October 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124596326204850176)

*The Gathering Storm*

*Towers of Midnight*
nine.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126009618995494912)

New Music bought. (New Daft Punk and E.S. Posthumus.) Deep breath taken. Goal: 10% (30k words) in two weeks. And...go.

A couple of days ago, you said your goal for the next handful of days was 30k words. How final- or draft-ish are those 30k?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 October 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127118936973115392)

Pretty draft-ish. I tend to do a quick first draft, then polish a lot.

#### [DENNIS HIGBEE](http://twitter.com/den_down_unda/status/127119851637579776)

How many more drafts do you expect to go through before you turn

in to Harriet?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127122354248744960)

Two or three.

Sorry to vanish for a few days, folks. Been making a big push to get
*A Memory of Light*
done. Still a lot of work to do, but the end is in sight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132262944909176832)

Cautiously moving the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up to 90% done, reflecting work finished this week and last.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132263311063515137)

This last 10% is going to be tough to call. I'm not ready to put in the chunk that RJ wrote yet. We're close, but not there yet.

#### [FANTASY AUTHOR](http://twitter.com/AuthorRTkaelin/status/132266458846732288)

Are you starting to get a little wistful? Getting to the end must feel... so final.

I've been all over on this, when people ask me. I think Tor has been saying fall, but I am not certain.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136141254525321216)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (28 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/141201624503828480)

Back at home, sitting before my fireplace, taking a deep breath and preparing to dive back into
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142294605533159424)

Still hard at work on
*A Memory of Light*
here. Want to do a blog post to wrap up The Great Hunt and my tour, but so far, haven't had time.

## [Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#55)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142640701451149313)

Moved
*A Memory of Light*
from 90% done to 92% done on my website progress bar. Getting very close now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142642984679256064)

Writing a conversation between two of the Forsaken right now.

#### [DEL REY SPECTRA](http://twitter.com/DelReySpectra/status/142646082390859776)

I read this too quickly and thought you said "writing a conversation between two of the Foreskin right now".

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142649552279834624)

That would be a VERY different book, eh?

## [Entry #56](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#56)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144176663306043394)

For those who do not know, Darrell Sweet—illustrator of all of the Wheel of Time covers—has passed away.
[My thoughts.](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1039/Darrell-Sweet)

#### [ANDREA DIGNEY](http://twitter.com/atheistcanuck/status/144177648980066304)

If the cover is scrapped, will the book be delayed?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144186099797995521)

No. We have enough time for someone else to do one.

## [Entry #57](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#57)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144915868323807234)

Okay,
*A Memory of Light*
is going fine..the book is awesome, but it feels like I've been working on it FOREVER. I need some motivation, so...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144916293571715072)

I'm going to start doing what I did last year. If I hit my wordcounts, I will open a pack of Magic cards as a reward. Yes, I'm a nerd.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144921913116999680)

People are asking how close the draft is to being done. Close, but I keep realizing there are points that need expanding.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144927389334503424)

Current length of
*A Memory of Light*
: 313,000 words.
*Towers of Midnight*
—the longest of the two I've done so far—was 335k.
*A Memory of Light*
will be at least that long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144927533715042305)

It WILL come out next year, and will not be split again. I'm close to the end, but still have several weeks worth of hard work to do.

#### [SKYLA GRIMES](http://twitter.com/skylatron/status/144927754855526400)

Is there a word-count length that you are encouraged not to exceed?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144927893972201472)

Over 400k would really be pushing it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144928342368464896)

And, as 5:00 rolls around, I have managed (barely) to hit my 2k wordcount goal so far today. Time for a Magic pack!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144928737408978944)

This one was sent to be by a fan, via my Amazon wishlist. (No name was included.) Whoever you are, thanks! The rare is:
<http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=246954>

#### [LOCAL VIEWER](http://twitter.com/greg5x5/status/144929049272258561)

Is the infamous last scene Robert Jordan left behind already part of the 313,000 words?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144930425096241152)

No, it is not. So the 'finished' length is actually longer. I haven't put that chunk in yet.

#### [JEFF](http://twitter.com/swordwraith/status/144928558140235776)

Is your average word count goal/day usually 2k?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144930614175465472)

On a WoT novel, which is much harder, that is a fair count. On something simpler, 3-4k is average.

#### [DONAGH MARNANE](http://twitter.com/enanram/status/144930100012515329)

I'm just wondering why you have a daily wordcount—surely the quality is more important than the length?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144930902319964160)

I believe that daily goals are important, as crafting a great book requires work as much as it does inspiration.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144931005143326720)

Laying down a rough first draft, then polishing over and over, is the path I've found to creating excellent work.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/144930899853713408)

Have you written through the ending for all the main characters? If so, is the rest just "expanding" scenes out?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144931074995257346)

Not all of them yet. Just a few.

#### [ROBYN ESTERBIZZLE](http://twitter.com/rzester/status/144973327470047232)

You are working on the final book in an epic series that people have been reading for decades and you need a game for motivation?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144978255479455744)

Even when you love what you do, it can be hard to work 12 hour days to finish a book after an exhausting tour.

## [Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#58)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145204337944178688)

Back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. May be the day to reveal a side-character's long-hidden motivations .

#### [JAMES BIRTLES](http://twitter.com/Jamesbirtles/status/145224714254684160)

Do we get a clue as to whom this character is?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145228240993267712)

If I told you that, you'd be expecting it. I'm afraid it is a RAFO. This character HAS been a little suspicious.

#### [LEBO GUME](http://twitter.com/goo_meh/status/145205670738804736)

Mr. @BrandSanderson please stop teasing
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145206086071353345)

Sorry. Some people really want to watch the progress, and so I try to keep the posts as spoiler-free as possible.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145229334611898368)

This afternoon's "Brandon opens Magic cards as he writes" comes sponsored by Sarah Bartram, who sent the cards off my wishlist. Thanks!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145229452165648385)

The rare was this card (which is sweet, since I like zombie cards):
<http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230786>

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145275634850074624)

Just wrote a scene with Bela in it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145281180365889537)

This scene is one that RJ left instruction for in his notes; it gave me shivers when reading.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145289584618647552)

Okay, that scene's done, and it is beyond awesome. Over 3k done; opening another pack sent by Sarah B. ...Mythic rare!
<http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247236>

## [Entry #59](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#59)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146305563486199808)

Okay, deep breath, back to work at the WoT. Can I be finished by Koloss Head-munching Day? (December 19th.) We shall see...

#### [BEN TACOMA](http://twitter.com/BenTacoma/status/146306397620023296)

Who would win—a massive Koloss or an Ogier warrior from Seanchan?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146307444446998529)

Ogier are far smarter and better-trained. A koloss would have a hard time winning.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146307828758478848)

(For those confused, Koloss Head-Munching Day happens on my birthday. It has a long backstory that won't fit into my post here.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146307975617843200)

The short is this: A fan asked if there were any holidays in the Mistborn world. I jokingly said Koloss Head-Munching Day. Fans ran with it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146313138239844352)

For today's
*A Memory of Light*
work, I'm jumping back in the book a little ways and catching up a character to the rest.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146343886338527235)

Just finished re-reading some important bits of WoT Book Two in order to write this next section of
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [CHRISTOPHER](http://twitter.com/cdav82/status/146345384896237568)

When is
*A Memory of Light*
out? I thought January, but I've heard it's been put back?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146346174805323777)

My goal is to finish it by January. Sorry about the delay. It will be next year some time, but probably later in the year.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146355819607375873)

Current
*A Memory of Light*
length: 322,000 words. Moving us to 94% done, though I can't say exactly how much is left. 94% is just a guess at this point.

## [Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#60)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146673171339296768)

Just finished
[a scene](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#16)
in
*A Memory of Light*
that ranks among the most visually powerful I've ever done. I REALLY want to see this one in film form.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146680787004166144)

A lot of questions about the WoT film rights. Universal has the rights. Maybe I should have phrased my last tweet as...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146681005657436160)

"Dear Universal, please do a good job on the first WoT movie, because you really, REALLY need to get to book 14 and do this scene."

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146705260990316545)

I don't know how far off the WoT film is. The screenwriters produced a new draft of the script a few weeks back. I have not read it.

#### [Selene O'Rourke](http://twitter.com/LenaOR/status/146708426255372288)

I would love to see a Wheel of Time movie series or TV miniseries. Has anyone optioned that you can mention?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146708565304938496)

Universal has the rights. Not an option, but a full buy-out.

#### [Muaz Zekeria](http://twitter.com/DukeSugaJones/status/146730339224649728)

Just out of curiosity would you prefer WoT to be a film series or a TV series a la
*Game of Thrones*
? Also keep up the great work.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733003635310593)

I would prefer television.

#### [Killer Bob](http://twitter.com/killer_bob_/status/146726816143523841)

Do you know if the film is going to be super-long like the
*Lord of the Rings*
movies, split in parts like Harry Potter or something ...

#### [Killer Bob](http://twitter.com/killer_bob_/status/146727181056344064)

...else? Also, thank you for finishing WoT! I really, really like the books you've written, they're excellent!

#### [Killer Bob](http://twitter.com/killer_bob_/status/146727466663284736)

By that I mean the WoT books. I like the other books too (especially Mistborn), but not as much as WoT.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733147873214464)

Thanks for reading! The plan now is one film that covers
*Eye of the World*
, and will be somewhat long.

#### [Chase Emory](http://twitter.com/ChaseEmory/status/146716321390931969)

I don't understand why you wouldn't be working integrally with the screenwriter, I hope they realize that this isn't a movie...

#### [Chase Emory](http://twitter.com/ChaseEmory/status/146716568821317632)

...that they can just pump out. They need to do an amazing job or not waste their time.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733415176220673)

I'm hoping they will let me comment on the screenplay, but so far, I've been kind of busy with
*A Memory of Light*
...

#### [Nate Rios](http://twitter.com/nathantrios/status/146740728251432961)

I haven't read WOT but these
*A Memory of Light*
Tweets are making me want to check it out! I've not read any of Jordan's work. Thoughts?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146741080493273088)

I love the WoT, and have for many years. It is a long journey, however, so be warned.

#### [Christopher](http://twitter.com/cdav82/status/146345384896237568)

When is
*A Memory of Light*
out; I thought January, but I've heard its been put back?

#### [Shaun Duquette](http://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/146472896162836480)

Gah,this is unacceptable!! You've already delayed this once!!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146817866090561536)

Not much I can do, I'm afraid. I'm turning it in on time; the date is being set by the publisher.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146732933921767424)

Okay, that scene is done. Now I have a few quick, one-shot viewpoints to do. People you may not expect.

#### [Josh Hlibichuk](http://twitter.com/qrevolution/status/146733192353808384)

Do we get a Dark One PoV? Is that question an auto-RAFO?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146737032172015617)

RAFO, of course. :)

## [Entry #61](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#61)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146836323989340160)

Back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. I have two early sequences I left half-finished because I felt I needed to lay down more important sequences first.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147061046237077504)

Still working on those smaller, early-book sequences I mentioned . This one involves a character who had his first viewpoint in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147066488279412736)

Good progress on
*A Memory of Light*
this week. Around 3k Monday and Tuesday, and 2.4k words today so far.

## [Entry #62](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#62)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147392541782835200)

Scene I'm working on needs to be trashed and rewritten from a different viewpoint. Ah, well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147429223466930176)

Okay, the scene is working much better now. Basically, a half-day lost, but it is worth backing up if something isn't working.

#### [JOE LAVOIE](http://twitter.com/lavoiejh/status/147431953774284800)

When you say a scene isn't "working" what does that mean? Bad mojo, doesn't feel right, or its there a technical reason?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147433574637912065)

All three, actually. Mostly, it just feels wrong.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147447042556432384)

And it is fixed now. Hard to judge my wordcount today, since I spent time fixing, but I'm opening a pack of Magic cards as a reward.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147448464375156736)

Current length of
*A Memory of Light*
: 335,000 words, same size as
*Towers of Midnight*
. And I haven't finished yet, nor have I added in RJ's ending.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147448653332742145)

Even with edits, this will be the longest of the three WoT books I've done. Don't worry about it being split, though. That won't happen.

#### [DANIEL ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/Sp00nyDan/status/147449491623129088)

Is RJ's ending ready for primetime? Or do you have an outline of how it is supposed to go?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147450009732915203)

I should be able to put it in without changing anything other than a quick smoothing of the language.

#### [SISTER INFANT](http://twitter.com/SinisterInfant/status/147449172252033024)

Will there be any indication in the book as to when RJ's ending starts? Like a footnote from you or Harriet or something?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147450126074511360)

No, but I will tell you once the book is out, after you've read it.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/147456267747733504)

Hello! Just wondering, was the Borderland Tower sequence in
*Towers of Midnight*
(with Malenarin Rai) originally part of RJ's prologue?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147457148769665025)

He wrote most of that scene himself, actually.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/147463519762268160)

Cool! Are you allowed to say whether it was part of his prologue (which I gather you split and distributed over
*The Gathering Storm*
/
*Towers of Midnight*
)?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147464862526746624)

Yes, it was.

#### [JOE KOGELMANN](http://twitter.com/jk82672/status/147463304221171713)

What was the logest of all the WoT books? How many words?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147464951076896768)

Longest ones have been around 390k words. Books Four and Six. I forget which was the longer.

#### [STEPHEN HART](http://twitter.com/s_l_hart/status/147462355603820545)

Any chance of reading these alternate scenes once
*A Memory of Light*
is released; on your website maybe? Kinda like DVD deleted scenes...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465009163812864)

Maybe.

#### [GREG LINDSEY](http://twitter.com/glindsey212/status/147460328500899841)

Why do you suppose Wikipedia is inaccurate, saying
*Towers of Midnight*
[is] 325,998? Should it be edited? Are those word counts reliable?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465109969711104)

Likely, theirs is without the glossary, which I just noticed mine has in it.

#### [BRYAN](http://twitter.com/thebigpiro/status/147456493539692545)

but but but...Wikipedia says
*Towers of Midnight*
is 325,998 words! Who to trust, Wikipedia or the author!? \*brain explodes\*

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465239586283520)

Just noticed my edocument has the glossary attached. Maybe that's the reason for the difference. Mine is pre-copyedit too.

#### [DASUGO](http://twitter.com/Dasugo/status/147458214588461058)

You usually go through a vicious edit phase right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465325863120897)

Yes. I tend to cut 10%, but Harriet's suggestions have usually added about that much, and we've balanced at the end.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147811173625110528)

Still have a little work to do on this little sequence near the beginning of the book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147811308165791744)

A little background: I wrote half of it in June, but felt I needed to be working on main characters more, so left it to write Perrin.

## [Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#64)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (19 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/148858665787588608)

Many thanks, all, for the birthday (and Koloss Head-munching Day) wishes! You are all awesome. To celebrate, I'm writing
*A Memory of Light*
. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/148866527586816000)

To get ready for today's writing, I have put on my "Blood and Bloody ashes" shirt from Ta'veren Tees. (https://taverentees.com/threads/)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/148874411078975488)

Note that my wife stole my Koloss Head-Munching Day shirt for the day, which is why I'm not wearing it. (http://store.inkwing.com/happy-koloss-head-munching-day-t-shirt)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/148883967259574272)

Also, for
*A Memory of Light*
, I did finish the early-book material I'd left for later, and am back at the ending. My shirt is very appropriate today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/148903283229065217)

Hm... I haven't given any good
*A Memory of Light*
teases today, have I? Well, right now, one of the Forsaken is wearing the image of another Forsaken.

#### [POOKA](http://twitter.com/HardcorePooka/status/148907643350695936)

And I was hoping you would say one of the Forsaken was wearing another's pants.

Well, that too, of course.

## [Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#65)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149241435785396224)

Still hard at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. Today's scenes involve lots of loud noises.

#### [MARK HOWARD](http://twitter.com/pyper134/status/149241691424030720)

Just curious, have you read the end scenes that RJ wrote? Or are you waiting till you get there?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149245100357201920)

I read them as soon as I got them. I needed to use them as a target 'goal' for the book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149255710272794624)

Now, on to a scene that finally, at long last, fulfills something Min saw long ago...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149269548825194498)

I've finished all characters except Rand and Mat. (Note, I'm not writing in order; other characters have already-written scenes after this.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149269717981462528)

Now, I have to finish Mat's climax, write a few more Rand scenes, then add in RJ's ending material. Then we're done. Very close now.

#### [PATRICK](http://twitter.com/Darkenmal/status/149271331345674240)

What are your thoughts on ending the WoT series that Robert Jordan started so long ago? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149272211163852800)

Solemnity.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149335105662484481)

After a few hours with the family, am back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. It's slightly possible that I'll finish it sometime during the night.

#### [JENNIFER LIANG](http://twitter.com/dragonmount/status/149336144792924160)

Would that make tonight
*A Memory of Light*
Eve?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149336719899107328)

Ha. Yes, I guess it would.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149340681175965696)

You can follow along, if you wish. I have twenty small points on my outline left to hit. Maybe 10k words or so. I'll tweet as I pass them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149347053103890432)

First scene out of twenty finished. (Note that I'm using 'scene' here liberally to mean a point on the plot outline.)

#### [FRANK KWIATKOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/149346675943682049)

Can you tell us who has the last chapter?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149347136629243904)

Afraid that would spoil too much.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149347366909116416)

Note that as I approach an ending, my writing speed goes up, as I get momentum. 10k tonight is not impossible. (Though most days I do 2-3.)

#### [BRENT WEEKS](http://twitter.com/brentweeks/status/149353600617955328)

Good luck!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149354495250399232)

Thanks!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149360287135436801)

Two out of twenty scenes done. Eighteen left, and
*A Memory of Light*
will be finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149368777878933504)

Three out of Twenty of the remaining scenes in
*A Memory of Light*
have been finished. (If you're just now seeing this, check back to my last few posts.)

#### [MARCUS ENGSTROM](http://twitter.com/Rocky4228/status/149364385029173249)

How long was it after the first two books were finished until they were published?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149369005268930560)

For the first one, about a year. For the next, about six months. This will probably be closer to the first than the second.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149373879041798144)

Scene four was slightly shorter than the others. 4 out of 20 finished so far tonight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149383509608374272)

Scene #5 finished. 25% through the ending of
*A Memory of Light*
. Feeling good about these scenes. All is going very well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149384744726052865)

Some of you have asked if I got the Magic cards you sent me off of my Amazon wishlist. I did! I'm waiting to open them until I'm done with
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149385058455781376)

A few of these scenes are pretty emotional ones for me. It's been a long, long road. I started reading the WoT twenty-one years ago.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149387905104740352)

Just finished scene #6 out of the 20 remaining in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149392235266445313)

Scene seven is done. Thirteen more to go. This one...this one was tough to write.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149396007694761984)

I've apparently inspired a drinking game with this on both Twitter and Facebook. I'd join in, but: 1) Mormon. 2) BUSY WRITING END OF WOT. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149396354236547072)

Scene #8 is a tricky one. I know how it has to go, I just need to do it carefully. Getting close to having it right.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149399869134606337)

Scene #8 is finished. This is going well. I often build momentum like this during a powerful book ending, and this one is very powerful.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149400003432038400)

We shall see. We've still got three or four hours before I'd normally turn in for bed. If I start to get sleepy, I'll call it for the night.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149400117617754112)

No sense in pushing on if the quality starts to flag. Knowing myself, though, I'll be too excited to be tired for a while yet. Onward!

#### [LOCALPCGUY](http://twitter.com/localpcguy/status/149408927338082304)

Glad to hear things are ending well! I can't wait to read it. Think I have time for a full re-read before
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149410847142318080)

Depends on how quickly you read. :)

#### [DAVID MACKAY](http://twitter.com/vivalaye0/status/149400865730596864)

Cannot wait, but I agree. Is it really going to take a year to edit and publish?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149403027244204032)

I've done a dozen drafts each of the previous two books. That kind of thing takes a little bit of time...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149402813154328577)

I just did something to Mat that I've been gleefully waiting to do for three years.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149411958779678720)

Don't stress the thing I did to Mat too much. It's a little (and fun) thing I've wanted to see him do for a long time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149410700467503104)

I have finished scene #9 out of 20 I need to write before
*A Memory of Light*
is done.

#### [AVI DOBKIN](http://twitter.com/asdobkin/status/149407450271973376)

Best of luck to @BrandSanderson as I turn in for the night. I'm giddy for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149410968550649856)

Hopefully, you will wake to find the book finished.

#### [CHRISTINA BOULARD](http://twitter.com/ChristinaBWho/status/149404223501635584)

It's almost 3:30am here and I SHOULD be in bed, but I feel like I need 2 stay up and cheer you on and also to witness THE END!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149411512908394497)

Ha. Well, there are still hours left to go, I suspect. I started at...what, 9:00 here? I'm to 1/2 and it's almost 2:00?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149412109124513792)

For those asking, it's almost 2:00 am here. The night is still young.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149415300989845504)

Just finished Scene #10. Halfway there!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149434842428358656)

I don't expect it to go longer than those. After editing, I'm pretty sure we'll settle at 350-360k words. (About 10% longer than
*Towers of Midnight*
.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149437707318341632)

Brace yourselves. I just finished the last Mat Cauthon scene that, in all likelihood, will ever be written.

#### [FRANK KWIATKOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/149440186177163264)

General writing question: after The editor edits, is it typical for an author to add/rewrite, or only the editor?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149440881605345281)

Only the author rewrites or adds. Never the editor. (in most cases.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149441211474780160)

The fourteenth scene was Mat's, and now I've finished the fifteenth scene. Five more to go, and
*A Memory of Light*
is done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149447495011938304)

Just finished scene #16. Four more to go. Guess I'm not stopping tonight, eh?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149458247458373632)

Scene #17 is finished. I was a tad on the longer side for the ones I'm doing here, as are the last three. 5:00 am here.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149458721389543424)

I keep flashing back to times I've read the WoT books through my life. Looking back, you could call Rand/Mat/Perrin my oldest friends.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149466193844121600)

Scene #18 is done. Two more to go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149469612805849088)

Scene #19 is done. Deep breath. I'm beginning the last scene I will write in the Wheel of Time, then will add RJ's ending.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149461870774992897)

I've been listening to Pandora as I do this, but am wondering if I should pick a specific song to listen to as I finish. Suggestions?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149482573742096384)

My choice for a song to play as I write the last few paragraphs here:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-0G_FI61a8>

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149486690447273984)

Ladies and gentlemen,
*A Memory of Light*
—the final book in The Wheel of Time—has been finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149488048156065792)

Now I'll open a metric gigaton of Magic cards that have been sent to me by fans, sleep for a day, and rest until next week.Then: revisions!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149488493406584833)

As for when the book will come out, Tor should do an announcement soon. Revisions will take a good six months. So fall, I expect.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149491208631230464)

Another common question: How many revisions will I do? The last two took about a dozen. (On non-WoT books, I do about seven or eight.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149491672886165504)

Also, it's going to be tough to give direct replies to questions right now, what with like 1000 people tweeting/facebooking at me. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149491990390784001)

But lots of people are asking about outriggers/prequels. The answer is still the same. We'd rather not risk exploiting RJ's legacy.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149492254040522752)

It is a step I don't think we want to take. Better to stop while we're ahead. I'm sorry, but they probably won't ever happen.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149492922969112576)

And now, yes, I will go to sleep. 7am here. That's 10 hours of solid writing after a full day of solid writing, so I'm beat.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149493040434786306)

Thank you all for the good wishes. May you find water and shade.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (AFTER A NAP)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149636055744774144)

Ah. Good morning, all. (Yes, it's five in the afternoon here.) Checking email, and...INBOX EXPLOSION. I guess I was expecting it. :)

## [Entry #66](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#66)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152131611146719232)

Whew. Got the flu on Sunday night, only now recovering. Time to start the
*Memory of Light*
second draft.

#### [SARAH ISTED](http://twitter.com/sazzlesrox/status/152134605477130240)

I'm curious—will Harriet edit RJ's last scene or are we going to see it as is?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152137847548297216)

Harriet will edit it, as she's edited everything else. (But maybe we'll post the earlier form sometime after the book's out.)

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/152134598208405504)

For second draft are you going through and making corrections to stuff Team Jordan pointed out?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152137996601266177)

No, second draft is for fixing things I know need fixing. The draft is pretty messy right now.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/152139208608321537)

Ah ok that's interesting. That's one great thing I love about you updating us on this is I'm fascinated at all that goes...

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/152139296747429888)

...into large books like these. It's definitely not one or two draft processes haha.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152140876607533056)

Both of the previous ones went through about a dozen drafts.

#### [MATTHEW RAMSEY](http://twitter.com/RCDLattimer/status/152133401242112000)

How long does a second draft usually take?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152138151345917952)

A couple of weeks, usually. It's different for different books, though, depending on how 'clean' the first draft is.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152151407858954242)

Yay! First scene revised. Only (...counts...) two hundred and twenty one left to go. ... Oh. Back to work, I guess.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152153149975707649)

Of course, not all scenes are the same length. A better guide will be this: I'm on page 15 of 1800 manuscript pages in the revision.

## [Entry #67](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#67)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (3 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154358276845342721)

3% done (60/1800 pages) done on the
*A Memory of Light*
draft. It will speed up quickly as I get my groove.

## [Entry #68](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#68)

#### [Shaun Duquette (12 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/157893003351048192)

Are you almost done whatever it is you're doing with
*A Memory of Light*
? Because drawing out the last book is getting crazy.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157900013635239938)

I'm trying to get it revised as quickly as I can. This book is going to need a lot of care to make sure I don't miss anything.

#### [EIREMAUVE (13 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/Eiremauve/status/157942023566000128)

Who has the most POVs? Is it a tie between a couple people?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157967694656839680)

Boy, I haven't counted. Rand/Perrin/Egwene/Mat are all probably about neck and neck.

#### [L-Etrengere](http://twitter.com/l_etrangere/status/157971937673494528)

[
*Now-protected tweet that said something about Egwene getting so many POVs.*

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974938190483456)

Well, she IS one of the main characters of the series. It would be kind of odd to leave her out of the Last Battle...

#### [WILL HAGEN](https://twitter.com/_kyte/status/157973622512820224)

Will there be an audiobook release along side the text (with Micheal perhaps)?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974641510584320)

Yes, there should be.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157975534897332224)

Okay, I'm off until later tonight. Progress on the revision is going well; I expect to be done by mid-February, maybe by the end of January.

#### [NICK](https://twitter.com/TheeLostOne/status/158042944870416385)

Is there an official release date for the final book yet? Last I heard was March.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/158057057180860418)

There isn't yet, though it will be fall. Harriet asked for more time to edit, and I needed time to do more research.

#### [JARED OLSEN](https://twitter.com/bigkid1545/status/158007886524588032)

You probably hear this often, but you have done an outstanding job on WOT books. Thank you for honoring Jordan and saving fans. #mistborn

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/158057160679501824)

It has been an honor.

#### [MAUZ ZEKERIA](https://twitter.com/Muazimus_Prime/status/159887320315723776)

Any plans for a WoT game?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159889021689004032)

Yes, there are many plans. I don't know how far along they are, however.

#### [MARIT K. AMUNDSEN](https://twitter.com/maritkamu/status/159891573151252480)

Any news for a date on WoT?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159892379195801600)

Fall, most likely.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160104744491290624)

For those curious, I did finish the video game work I needed to do last night, and am back at work on the WoT revision today.

#### [PAUL MCINTYRE](https://twitter.com/AnotherOneXD/status/160118064946491393)

Was
*Towers of Midnight*

Yes.

Boarded the plane for Tokyo, stage two of my Flight to Taiwan. 10 hours, during which I will be editing
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (31 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164258686829740032)

Hm. 1:00 am at home, 5:00pm here. I've been up for twenty-three hours now. Perhaps not the best time to try working on
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164778529626652672)

I wrote a few short Wheel of Time posts for @tordotcom. The first, on THE EYE OF THE WORLD, went up today.

Other fun things from Brandon's spelling mind: I always want to write Darlin Sisnera's name "Darlin Sinestro." Crossover time!

Just updated the % for

draft two to 70%. Should have the whole book done and off to Harriet in a week or so.

Hi Brandon. What's the official release date for the final Wheel of Time novel? Can't wait!!!!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167327582101057536)

I don't think there is one yet. Fall, sometime, probably. But Harriet is the one who will decide.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167329980257271809)

A lot of people ask after the release date. Fall/Winter this year is still likely. However, I would like to note that Harriet is in charge.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167330096628244480)

She hasn't yet read the entire book; she gets to decide when it will be released. She can delay it or push it up, whatever she wants.

Working on one of the big, climactic sections at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
right now. Not many names left to draw, I'm afraid. A handful, maybe.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (15 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169844956855414785)

There's another of my Wheel of Time musings up at @tordotcom, this one about
*The Great Hunt*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169886566414692353)

By the way, as many have noted, it appears that RJ, myself, and Wheel of Time were involved in a Jeopardy! clue yesterday.

#### [TOR.COM (16 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/tordotcom/status/170218623858782208)

The release date for
*A Memory of Light*
, the final volume of The Wheel of Time (@torbooks ), has been revealed: http://bit.ly/x2BVp5

#### [JASON DENZEL](https://twitter.com/dragonmount/status/170226524941844482)

For people wondering, it takes a long time to go from a first draft to final draft. @BrandSanderson did 16 edits on
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### [COWSLIP](https://twitter.com/cowslip0/status/170227624092774401)

It must publish before 21.12.2012... what if the Mayan are right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170229671219298304)

Lol.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/170225113118150656)

So...January 2013? Is this because @BrandSanderson needs time to join the witness protection program before the fans learn who dies in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170229817789259776)

No, but I might need to head into it now, once the more vocal fanbase hears their book is delayed a few more months.

#### [KVOTHE THE ARCANE](https://twitter.com/KvotheEdemaRuh/status/170223824393084928)

My respect for Harriet has gone downhill. I think If I were to look in her eyes all I'd see are $$

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170236320172613632)

I'm not sure why, since this choice might end up costing her money. It certainly isn't a market decision.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170237402139467777)

The release date for
*A Memory of Light*
has been set. Here are my thoughts.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 February 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/172056873497927682)

Hey, all.
*A Memory of Light*
revision is all done and sent off. The next draft is the big one, where I put in Harriet's comments. That can take a while.

## [Entry #75](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#75)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 March 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178623127310446592)

I've been thinking lately of ways to give away digital copies of my books when you buy a hardcover. There are some issues with this.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178623399168458752)

I don't know much about the logistics; it may be impossible. If there is a way to make this work, I'd propose it to Tor and Harriet for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178623641943162882)

Here's a
[reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qqlb2/marvel_comics_now_offering_free_ecomic_with/)
where I mention issues with the process. Weigh in here or in that thread to give me advice.

#### [SABERJ](https://twitter.com/Saberj/status/178623788211122176)

The only way I could think of would be to include one-time use codes with the books. But what's to stop people from selling?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624295004667905)

Yeah. The other problem with that is securing the code. Books aren't wrapped up, so the code could be scratched off/stolen easily.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624716515454976)

My preferred method would be to put a code in a book that, then, you can redeem for free or a small price. But how do we secure it?

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178628034377695234)

You don't. Your stuff is already being pirated and publishers shouldn't consider those lost sales. Trust people a la Apple.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628321821732865)

I'm not worried about piracy. However, a digital code that can be used many times seems foolish. A one-use would be stolen.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628434900172800)

One use has to be secured, or the person buying the book is in danger of being ripped off.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628628656046080)

Multi-use means that we're hosting the book, and paying the bandwidth, for those who want to pirate. Bad idea, I think.

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178628854628368385)

I'll host it for you. :) No charge.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629076897103872)

Lol. One other problem is that this needs to be reasonable enough to the publisher's ears to get them to go along.

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178629468879994880)

My point exactly. Big Pub doesn't get the new model. They consider pirated copies as lost sales. See Seth Godin for new model.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629706617339904)

The publishers aren't as ignorant as you think. The investors, however, are another story. (You're right about them.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629799667965954)

Tor has done plenty of giving away free, DRM-free ebooks. They did it with Mistborn, for example.

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178629953749921793)

Ah! To me as an outsider they are one and the same. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178630282365243392)

Publishers and editors in sf/f tend to be techies. Notice that Cory Doctorow, with Tor's blessing, releases all of his books for free.

#### [SABERJ](https://twitter.com/Saberj/status/178624667714719745)

How is Marvel doing it? They don't tend to wrap Comics either.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624862858911747)

I think you order directly from them, and they send you the comic and deliver through their own secure app.

#### [ANNE BURNER](https://twitter.com/anneburner/status/178624589826506753)

*Baen*
used to put a CD copy of the book inside the hardcover versions of @davidweber1 Honor Harrington books.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624996577513472)

I asked if we could do that, and the answer was that it was expensive enough it couldn't become the standard.

#### [WES QUINT](https://twitter.com/doubleewe/status/178625066878251008)

Maybe like a gift card where it's only active after purchase?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178625255101837313)

Yeah, this is probably the best idea. I don't know how hard that is to accomplish, though.

#### [SABERJ](https://twitter.com/Saberj/status/178625686418882561)

A lot of textbooks used to include a disc in the book for additional material. Discs are a bit harder to steal than codes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626034151854080)

Textbooks also have a much larger profit margin than novels. I asked about discs for my last book, and the publisher said no.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626118004383745)

They said it was just too expensive.

#### [BENJYMOUS](https://twitter.com/benjymous/status/178625646640119809)

Old school tech, I know, but how about a coupon you have to fill in with your email address then post back to the publisher?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626290801328130)

Ha. You know, I never thought about that. The problem is, how do we keep people from stealing them out of the books?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626364897898496)

People with a nice hardcover don't want to cut their book apart to get a coupon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626659275128834)

Here are a couple of problems with what people are suggesting. 1) We don't want to shrink wrap books, but a code can be stolen very easily.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626857044946944)

Anything involving the retailer verifying a code, or printing one out, requires large-scale involvement of retailers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626950540173312)

That's not something I can change. They may be working on this already. I want something I could take to Tor, that we could do in house.

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/178626683736309760)

Or if you're talking about securing the code in the book...it seems easy enough with textbooks. Peel-off? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627144837111810)

People would walk into the store, peel off the sticker, write down the code, then sell it or use it.

#### [BRAD LICKMAN](https://twitter.com/brad_lickman/status/178626571484135424)

How do you stop people from sharing a hardcover copy?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627305273425920)

The physical product can be made to set off an alarm. A code can be copied and carried out.

#### [ANDREW YAGER](https://twitter.com/andrewyager/status/178627233294983168)

Could codes be single use? That would largely get around the securing problem?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627499037696001)

People would walk into the store, write down the code, go home and download the book.

#### [KYLE](https://twitter.com/Drantis82/status/178627343814893568)

What about one-time scratch codes like what's used on gift cards?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627691463966720)

Those are usually activated by the retailer. I'd love for us to be able to do that, but it would involve more than I can do.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627934729404417)

Another issue with this is that if I did it, I would need it to work for indy booksellers and not just Amazon/Barnes & Noble.

#### [BRAD LICKMAN](https://twitter.com/brad_lickman/status/178628594149494784)

Can you sell the digital copy at http://tor.com, which provides a coupon for the hardcover?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628775460868097)

This is actually what I proposed to Tor a few years back, and they said they didn't want to offend the retailers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628829185716224)

I still like the idea, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629564552056832)

I won't have time to reply to everyone here, but keep sending thoughts. I'll read and see if I can come up with something to take to Tor.

#### [BEN FOXWORTHY](https://twitter.com/BenFoxworthy/status/178629545014988800)

How about this: Put the code in the book. Don't secure it. Each code works three times. Hope people don't abuse it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178630022960123904)

That risks punishing the person who buys the book (but their code has been stolen and used.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 MARCH)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/179073002024087552)

More on the
*A Memory of Light*
ebook thing. What would you guys think if I tried to talk Tor into a 'special edition' release.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/179073183037661185)

A kind of 'boxed set' that came with hardcover, ebook, audiobook, a medallion or other keepsake, and maybe some interviews with me & Harriet.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/179073695606779904)

Shrink wrapped & sold at bookstores for, say, $50 instead of $30? Does that get too far away from the 'free ebook w/the hardcover' concept?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/179073875416588288)

It does seem to defeat the purpose, as far as most people would be concerned. Though many would buy it.

#### [DAVE PUTNAM (22 MARCH)](https://twitter.com/dputanm/status/182871674331471872)

*A Memory of Light*
e-book release announced with three month gap. Can you explain the rationale behind this? Lot of vitriol on Tor site.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182908038942961664)

Harriet worries, among other things, at the impact on the bestseller lists by releasing at the same time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182908157205561344)

Ebooks make her uncomfortable.

#### [FYODOR](https://twitter.com/Fyodor32768/status/182886177156759552)

Making us wait three three months for the
*A Memory of Light*
ebook is very obnoxious and shows contempt for the fan base. I have been reading...

#### [FYODOR](https://twitter.com/Fyodor32768/status/182886495093391362)

...WOT since 1992 and deeply resent this type of staggering.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182907521831419906)

I've been working on it. The delay is not Tor, but Harriet, who worries at the implications of releasing an ebook immediately.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182907636247826432)

She originally wanted a six month, or longer, delay. I was able to persuade her to move to three months.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202865075529334784)

Maria from Team Jordan has finished her revision notes for the entire book, as has Harriet herself. So we're only waiting on Alan's notes.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202867911067574272)

(Winces.) Harriet has a distrust of ebooks; she prefers to delay the release. It is her call. (Ebook is a few months later.)

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/202870594893660161)

Do we have chapter names yet? Or do you know how many chapters there will be? Or is that a secret?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202871176723312640)

No chapter names yet, as it won't be until this draft is finished that I settle on the number of chapters. Some are being combined.

#### [Mark Prybyla](https://twitter.com/DFaninFla/status/202876831102275584)

I'm truly hoping this book is 1/3 battles/fights.

More than 1/3, I'd say...

#### [Daniel Shepard](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/202870928009474049)

Forgive me for not understanding, but what does this mean? Release date's not going to change, is it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202871282843398144)

Probably not. It's just a progress update, so people know things are still moving behind-the-scenes.

It is possible, but I don't know how likely. I still need to do two drafts, I feel. Then there are beta reads, then proofreads, then we need at least two months to get the books printed and shipped.

#### [Jason Palmer](https://twitter.com/salmidach/status/204705003921879040)

? Is it a complete NEW scene? If so is it because the editors thought it would fit into the book more, is this the second draft?

New scene. We often add new scenes in the second, third, or even last drafts of a book.

Can/Will you tell us anything about it? Please? :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204728953326407680)

I'm afraid I can't say much. I try to be extra-careful with WoT scenes out of respect for Harriet.

#### [Simon Draper](https://twitter.com/simondraper/status/204704627252408321)

When is the last book being published? I can't believe it's the end of the series already.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204704908828606464)

January.

#### [Maria Simons (21 May 2012)](http://www.facebook.com/sulamein/posts/3234785435483)

Team Jordan update: We’ve been getting a lot of questions about Brandon’s note that Harriet and I are finished with
*A Memory of Light*
, and Alan is almost finished. “Finished” here refers only to the first draft. The same day that I finished
*A Memory of Light*
, I started
*A Memory of Light*
(the second draft, or at least the portion of the second draft that Brandon has sent us). Harriet has already completed that section, and is ready to move on when we receive more. Alan should finish the first draft this week, and he will immediately begin again too. We’re not by any means truly finished with the book—we’re all working very hard, and we trust that Brandon is too. We want to get every detail right, and that takes time. Don't worry; it's worth waiting for.

## [Entry #84](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#84)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 June 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/210476400338145280)

Currently about 250,000 words (of 350,000) into my fourth draft of
*A Memory of Light*
. This is the hardest of the drafts. Next one should go faster.

#### [Dick Mock](https://twitter.com/RMock88/status/210482248309411840)

How many drafts do you usually do on your novels?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/210488326912868354)

Between eight and twelve, if you count the proofreads.

#### [R.T. Kaelin](https://twitter.com/AuthorRTkaelin/status/210480570277429249)

Curious... How many drafts is typical for you?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/210488406936002560)

Between eight and twelve.

#### [Dylan Bronstein](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21823997&offset=50&total_comments=81)

Do you from scratch on each draft?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824703&offset=0&total_comments=81)

No, I don't start from scratch most times. Only in extreme cases. A "Draft" for me is a complete, beginning-to-end, revamp of the book line by line. About half of the drafts are deep content drafts, the other half focus on prose.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824695&offset=0&total_comments=81)

Re: Timing—Yes, we're still on track for January. (I still secretly hope for sooner.)

#### [Ross Colwell](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824016&offset=50&total_comments=81)

Curious what makes this one the hardest.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824714&offset=0&total_comments=81)

This one is the hardest because it's the first one I do where I have to fix problems Team Jordan has found. That is difficult, as sometimes I've written entire sequences that have continuity errors with something in the series, so those sequences need to be pulled out and replaced with something that works.

#### [John O'Meara](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824029&offset=50&total_comments=81)

Does it get longer and shorter from draft to draft?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824721&offset=0&total_comments=81)

Some drafts make the book shorter, others longer. Usually, prose focused drafts shorten the book while content drafts make it longer.

#### [Jason Palmer](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824245&offset=50&total_comments=81)

Brandon, you've probably explained the draft system before, but for the uneducated can you possibly explain it again to me please?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150863345540009?comment_id=21824753&offset=0&total_comments=81)

Sure. First draft is my initial write of the book. Second draft is where I go through and fix major problems I introduced while writing the book. (For example, sometimes I'll add a character in because I find I need one, but I don't go back and revise them into earlier chapters until the second draft.) Third draft is a polish, fixing language and prose. Fourth draft is my first editorial draft, working with the editor to fix problems. Fifth is a second editorial draft. From there, I alternate between further polishing drafts and smaller-level editorial drafts as long as needs be.

Re: Stormlight—It's next. I will begin it as soon as
*A Memory of Light*
is done right. Likely, I'll start into it after draft five or six of
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson/posts/10150855272213837?comment_id=22033466&offset=0&total_comments=60)

RE: Length—This will be slightly longer than Towers of Midnight, I believe.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson/posts/10150855272213837?comment_id=22033486&offset=0&total_comments=60)

Re: Stormlight 2—It is next, I promise. I'm very eager to start, but I have to make sure
*A Memory of Light*
is done right first. You don't get many chances to work on a book like this one.

## [Entry #85](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#85)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 June 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211605030011289601)

Working on a new Rand scene today too. Still a few more I want to add. This is probably the last draft where I will add new scenes, though.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211679735288311808)

New Rand scene turned out great. Now, to revamp the next five to be just as awesome.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211679920231952384)

It's funny how time passes when I'm working on writing. It's been four hours since I started on the scene, and I barely noticed.

#### [Brenda Waldrop](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150869264200009?comment_id=21860217&offset=0&total_comments=33)

That I understand. I get in a writing groove and the next thing I know it's tomorrow!

#### [Shaunna Willoughby](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150869264200009?comment_id=21860220&offset=0&total_comments=33)

Focus is like an alternate plane of existence.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150869264200009?comment_id=21860225&offset=0&total_comments=33)

It's funny. I make a post, like the one a while back, and then think "I'll get back and answer people in a bit." Then, four hours later, I think "Okay, scene is done. Let's see what people are saying." That timestamp glares back at me, and there are like fifty posts I haven't ever replied to.

#### [Sam Noble](https://twitter.com/samnoble/status/211680532906516481)

Do you know the
*Game of Thrones*
guy? He could learn something from your work ethic.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211681342189084672)

Ha. Well, perhaps. But I could learn something from his writing skill, I suspect. We'll see how prolific I am when I'm his age.

#### [Vegas Surreal](https://twitter.com/VegasSurreal/status/211680608596926464)

We need @BrandSanderson to stay healthy; you're supposed to get up and stretch every 20 minutes!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211681131098144769)

Don't worry. I have a treadmill desk I work at.

#### [Marcus McQuarter](https://twitter.com/MarcusMCQ/status/211613803144675328)

How long is the book going to be at minimum?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211626176035303424)

350k words, I'd guess. First draft was 360. Next draft trimmed about 30k. I'm slowly increasing it back up.

## [Entry #86](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#86)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 June 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213022632919040002)

*A Memory of Light*
Update: On page 1500 of 1900 pages in my fourth draft. Still have a few new scenes to add.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213022743812259840)

Will do one more major draft after this, and then we will move into more line-edit/small tweaks drafts.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213029658004955136)

For those asking, about two manuscript pages become one final hardcover page. (Though it varies.) I'm planning seven or eight drafts total.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213029814829989890)

The drafts of this book have been more extensive than those of the previous two, but we will do fewer of them, probably.

#### [Jim](https://twitter.com/T3m3r1ty/status/213031303489126406)

How many offers do you get for volunteer proof readers each day?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035061266751490)

At least one a post. :)

#### [Hyrum Tanner](https://twitter.com/hyrumt/status/213023932813553664)

Is the word count still about 370K or has it increased?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213034928810639360)

It is hard to say, as my draft has lots of Team Jordan comments that are being counted in the final. I think it's 340k right now.

#### [Austin Moore](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/213031214079156224)

So would you say final book will be around 1000 pages or so?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035094905069568)

That's a good estimate.

#### [RJ Chap](https://twitter.com/rj_chap/status/213030971577081857)

Do you ever sell/auction copies of your drafts? Are you allowed?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035155303043073)

I have done it for charity in the past, but never with a WoT book.

#### [Matt Perry](https://twitter.com/MRPerry55/status/213032370603962368)

Still on for The 8th of January? ‪#countingthedays

Yes.

*A Memory of Light*
teaser: The book contains a new verse to a beloved WoT song. (Just posting to let you all know the revision goes well.)

#### [Jeff Gray](https://twitter.com/jeff_gray/status/215049617715376128)

Do you revise sections that Mr Jordan wrote, or just your own? No implication, just curious. :-)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/215163884896649218)

It's a good question. I initially tried to leave them all alone and let Harriet revise them.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/215164080527392769)

She told me to be more aggressive in smoothing out scenes to blend them together. I still do try to touch his as little as I can.

#### [Ian Thomson](https://twitter.com/SquiddlyBop/status/215091640157732864)

First tweet to you, but I wanted to say I'm so very excited for
*A Memory of Light*
! Can we change the release to January 7th? That's my birthday!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/215163614116593664)

I'll see what I can do... ;)

The song is probably "Jak o' the Shadows".

#### [Brandon Sanderson (29 June 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/218596880731480064)

I just sent my complete revision of
*A Memory of Light*
to Harriet. This is the fourth draft, and was every extensive a revision.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/218597068678250496)

Drafts of this book so far have been more in-depth than on
*Towers of Midnight*
or
*The Gathering Storm*
. I suspect we'll do seven or eight drafts total of this book.

#### [Doug Hill](https://twitter.com/DHStom/status/218597657847934976)

Are you trying to hint at a 2015 release date now? Because now I'm picturing Doc Brown with the book in the Delorean. >\_<

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/218598384896983040)

No, we'll have it done and ready for January.

will be published?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/221001418570612736)

Still January 8th, so far as I know. One more draft to do.

#### [wehaveatrex (6 July)](https://twitter.com/wehaveatrex/status/221327209498025984)

When the WoT is done, are you planning to write anything about the process of adapting RJ's work, like a Special Feature?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/221344345796788224)

I would like to, but no promises.

#### [Shaun Duquette](https://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/221263064920633345)

This is tragic, on the final draft and we still can't get the book by October or November!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/221345325359706112)

Well, when you count copyedit, proofreads, and printing time, it is still going to be tight.

Last draft of
*A Memory of Light*
needs to be done soon. For today, I'm polishing off the last two new Rand scenes (of about eight) I'm adding to the book.

#### [Ray Ellerd (11 July)](https://twitter.com/drelle64/status/222948566799368192)

Any news on WoT? Know you're sick of that question. Sorry... :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/222979744109572096)

Well, other than the last Rand scene (which I'm writing right now) not much. Need to finish the final draft as soon as possible.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 July)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223654498416082944)

Comic-conning for the night done. (Had dinner with a Hollywood producer.) Now, for some more WoT editing!

You know, it IS okay to rest and play once in a while!

Ha. Not when we're past deadline on this book. I'll rest when it's done.

Yup.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223743623861256193)

All right, WoT editing for the day done. This is going really well—the book is very nearly done. Just polishing, now.

Working away at
*A Memory of Light*
last draft. 80 pages remaining, and I'll be done. Probably will finish tonight.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/229155941109596163)

Last draft is done, folks. From here, we head to copyedits. (And perhaps small tweaks here and there.) Basically, though,
*A Memory of Light*
is finished.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/229165479531515904)

Thanks for the good wishes, all. Final length of the book is around 360k words.
*Towers of Midnight*
was 335k, for reference.

#### [Peter Orullian](https://twitter.com/PeterOrullian/status/229163824048123904)

Congratulations, Brandon. Most cool.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/229165779726237696)

Probably not going to change at this point.

Uh, it's done. I'm not working on it because it's finished, turned in, and getting printed.
