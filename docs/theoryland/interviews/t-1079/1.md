# [Interview #1079, Entry #1]: WoR Signing Report - Dawnshard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1079#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

So I asked Brandon at the LA signing if he could tell us about a shard that we don't know anything about (including the survival shard) and he said that there was a shard that isn't on a planet. Now I think this means that the shard is either on an asteroid, or a star. It could also be floating in space or on a moon and influencing from a distance. I will repeat it is not any shard we already know about.
