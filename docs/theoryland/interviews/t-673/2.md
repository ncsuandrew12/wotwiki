# [Interview #673: Orbit Books Interview Snippets, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=673#2)

#### Marie Curie

Here's the first one, posted 14 October 2011. It's basically just a plug to look out for promotional stuff over the next year or so. I do like how it displays at the end that
*A Memory of Light*
is coming out in November 2012. And I was also amused by Brandon's glasses being crooked...

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is Brandon Sanderson, sitting here in London as we begin the last year until the Wheel of Time finally ends. This is a very bittersweet experience for a lot of us. I know a lot of you have been reading the books for quite a long time. I started them myself back in, boy, 1990, so we're coming to the end. And as this last year passes, we will be doing lots of fun events. You can watch the Orbit web site for all sorts of interesting promotions. And, as we launch
*Towers of Midnight*
in paperback, we're going to do all sorts of fun promotions.
