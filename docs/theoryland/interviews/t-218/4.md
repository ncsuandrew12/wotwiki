# [Interview #218: KOD Signing Report - Mashiaramanda, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=218#4)

#### Mashiaramanda

Lastly, I asked (which is the question I asked last year, but all I got was a RAFO) if he could throw us a bone as to where to look for clues to who Mesaana is in the Tower.

#### Robert Jordan

He did not, in fact, throw me a bone.
