# [Interview #218: KOD Signing Report - Mashiaramanda, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=218#5)

#### Mashiaramanda

All in all, the signing was great. He was funny, candid, and looked great. He really makes a point to take time with each person in line signing books. Hope some of you can make it to a signing this year.
