# [Interview #7: TOR Questions of the Week Part III, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=7#23)

#### Week 23 Question

*The Dragon Reborn*
an early version of Shaidar Haran? Its response that it likes to keep an eye on 'all who serve me' and its apparent sense of humor are behavior atypical of a Fade.
