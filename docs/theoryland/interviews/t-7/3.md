# [Interview #7: TOR Questions of the Week Part III, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=7#3)

#### Week 3 Question

After Moiraine fought Lanfear in Cairhien, what happened to the wagons full of
*ter'angreal*
and such that came out of the Aiel Waste? Are they just in some storeroom there? And what happened to Moiraine's horse Aldieb?

#### Robert Jordan

The
*ter'angreal*
and so forth that came from Rhuidean are still in Cairhien for the moment, warded by Rand so they aren't accessible to anyone but him. Aldieb is in the stables at the Sun Palace.
