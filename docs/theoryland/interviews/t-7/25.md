# [Interview #7: TOR Questions of the Week Part III, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=7#25)

#### Week 25 Question

After reading a book like
*Misery*
by Stephen King I think that I would be terrified to be a writer. What has been your creepiest experience with a fan?

#### Robert Jordan

I haven’t had any creepy experiences with fans unless you count the bikers who came to a signing after hearing a rumor—untrue—that I was in very bad health and threatened to desecrate my grave if I died before finishing the books. That was a little on the odd side, especially since they looked as if they might desecrate graves for a hobby. On the whole, my fans seem to be pretty sane. No freeze dried cats as presents. No requests for autographs in blood. Oh, a few women have volunteered to have my baby, but that’s a whole different thing.
