# [Interview #29, Entry #5]: KOD Signing Report - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=29#5)

#### Ted Herman

Did Artur Hawkwing know he was a hero of the Horn? (I asked this because of a quote in BWB when he was on his deathbed, saying the battle is not over yet).

#### Robert Jordan

No, not when he was alive.
