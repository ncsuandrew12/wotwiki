# [Interview #642: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Lord Juss, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=642#14)

Why did Grady and Neald stop tying off gateways?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They found that it didn’t work as well as they originally thought. Tied-off gateways behaved in strange ways; they were inefficient, ineffective, and unpredictable. There was also a considerable continuing cost to maintaining even a tied-off gateway. I can’t remember exactly when the change happened, but I think it was Jordan who made it. You can armchair this and see that he had to create a reason why they didn’t just tie off gateways all the time. If they could do that, then they would just have gateways everywhere and that would be that. So, he had to have an in-book reason to explain an out-of-book issue.
