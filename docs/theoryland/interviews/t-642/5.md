#### Question

Having worked on Robert Jordan’s world, is there any other world you would like to write for?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I was 18, I would have said David Eddings, but that’s not true now. He’s wonderful at the right age, but I no longer want to write in his world. I would have said
*Star Wars*
but the prequels left a bit of a sour taste. If George Lucas said to me, "Do you want to re-write those prequels for me?" I’d definitely say yes, but that’s not going to happen!
