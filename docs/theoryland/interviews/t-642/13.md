#### LordJuss

You’ve said previously that when you were a young man you identified with Rand over the other boys, but now you’re older, you identify more with the older characters. Do you think when you are 80 you will identify with Cadsuane?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe with Thom Merrilin. I think I would need to be the full 300 to completely identify with Cadsuane.
