# [Interview #642: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Lord Juss, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=642#11)

#### Question

Do you miss characters when you “write them out”?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nice euphemism. I miss writing for them but it doesn’t shock me because I generally planned it that way, so I have time to prepare. I don’t see myself as killing them. Instead, I allow them to take risks and pay the price for those risks. Mostly, I know well in advance what will happen to a character. Just occasionally, though, the plot will suddenly take me to the point when something has to happen, then I have to go back and re-write the outline. I don’t sit there and think, “Now who won’t they expect me to kill," although I suspect some other authors might do that. (General laughter ensued at that point.)
