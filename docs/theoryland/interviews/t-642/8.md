# [Interview #642: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Lord Juss, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=642#8)

#### Question

A lot of your work deals with stereotypes. Can you tell us more about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s true, but I always make sure that it isn’t just about the stereotype. It’s a fun thing to challenge some of the classic fantasy models, but that shouldn’t take over the writing as that can really undermine a writer. Piers Anthony was an example where the puns were fun but eventually came to undermine the series. I like having non-stereotypical professions and I enjoyed challenging age perceptions in
*Way of Kings*
. Having a romance between a man in his 50s and a woman in her late 40s is unusual in fantasy, where it’s all about the young man falling in love.
