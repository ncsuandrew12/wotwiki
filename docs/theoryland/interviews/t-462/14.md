#### Brandon Sanderson

When asked to briefly describe
*The Way of Kings*
(Brandon's forthcoming epic fantasy series) he said he is not good at short descriptions. Harriet humorously interjected that is precisely the reason that he was hired. He went on for a bit about
*The Way of Kings*
(WoK?!). What sets it apart from other epic fantasy, which is done in a setting where magic is in decline and the world has lost much of the splendor it once held, is that
*The Way of Kings*
is about a "renaissance of magic".
