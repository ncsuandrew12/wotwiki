# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#34)

#### Question

What did you think would happen at the end before you read the ‘real ending’?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon talked a long time about how the first place he ever went on the web was rec.arts.rj. He talked about how RJ stood on the shoulders of giants, mentioning JRR Tolkien by name and he also said that he was surprised that RJ’s genius hadn’t crushed the giants beneath him. When he finally read the ending that RJ wrote he felt the ending was right, perfect and satisfied the promise of the books. He went on to say that aspects of the ending surprised him but that they made perfect sense.
