# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#30)

#### Question

Will there be either prequels or outrigger novels?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that he didn’t know but he hoped that the answer would be no. His reasoning was that WoT was RJ’s universe and that after
*A Memory of Light*
and the encyclopedia it should be “allowed to go to rest” however he did say that the final decision was Harriet’s.

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet said there was a Kenny Rogers song that fit perfectly here. “Know when to hold them and know when to fold them”. She said that she hadn’t made up her mind yet and would not until after
*A Memory of Light*
and the Encyclopedia were published. [From Peter's other report: "It is something they will get into once the
*A Memory of Light is in the bag*
, but the tone of their replies seemed to suggest that is was not even close to a done deal."
