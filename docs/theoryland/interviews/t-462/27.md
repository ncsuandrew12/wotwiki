# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#27)

#### Question

How much leeway were you given when writing the book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was given complete freedom to write, but that he was in constant contact with Maria and Alan about details. He compared it to a broken vase, much of it could be glued together but there were places where there were holes that needed to be filled in.

#### Maria Simons

Maria interjected with the fact that there are well over 1200 files that are at least several sentences long and many many more that are shorter than that.

#### Harriet McDougal

There was some back and forth with Harriet and Brandon about the writing/editing process. Harriet said a good editor never tells an author how to write. Brandon said that he actually writes the book for Harriet and it’s Harriet’s job to perfect it.
