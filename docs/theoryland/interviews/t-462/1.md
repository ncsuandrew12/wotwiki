# [Interview #462, Entry #1]: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#1)

#### Terez

This is a combination of two reports made by the same person on the same event. The report at Thirteenth Depository almost makes the Stormleader report obsolete, but not quite, so those extra tidbits are recorded here. The redundant questions have only been entered once; all of them were reported in more detail at Thirteenth Depository. Some of them are further repeated in
[Ted Herman's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=464)
