The party was lots of fun. There was even a Dragon cake.

After the party there was a small catered dinner for us StormLeaders and team Jordan. This is what I was really waiting for, a chance to pepper Brandon, Harriet and Maria with questions about Wot in general and
*The Gathering Storm*
in particular. I only and a few questions…two pages in #10 font single spaced! Of course everyone else had questions too so as we ate we asked him questions. It was a Wot geek’s dream come true. Since most of you are waiting for this part I’ll get to it without further ado.

Brandon is a very funny guy. First of all he said he would reveal Asmodean’s killer
  
then there was a perfectly timed pause…

  

“Asmodean’s killer is Robert Jordan!”

It got a good laugh. Brandon’s sense of comedic timing is very good.

SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!
  
Note that some of the following questions and answers entail plot points from
*The Gathering Storm*
