#### Brandon Sanderson

Writing
*The Gathering Storm*
, Brandon admits he received input from numerous sources. He was, however, uncomfortable discussing the amount of input and the amount of freedom he had in writing
*The Gathering Storm*
. He says maybe after
*A Memory of Light*
he will reveal a bit more about what specifically was RJ's. Generally though, he was unrestricted in his writing, and Harriet, as editor, was there to perfect what he had done.
