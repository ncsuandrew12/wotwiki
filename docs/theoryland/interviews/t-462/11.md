# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#11)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Regarding the notorious clue that everyone has missed, Brandon pinned it down to somewhere between books 4-6 (reread time!). He reiterated how astonished we would be when we found it...but won't get any more specific for fear of ruining our surprise. Also, the "never mentioned" aspect of the clue might not be entirely true, but Brandon himself has never come across it. Maria had a knowing smile at the time, suggesting maybe it has been mentioned. Time will tell.
