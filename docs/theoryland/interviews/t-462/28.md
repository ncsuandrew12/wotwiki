# [Interview #462, Entry #28]: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#28)

#### Question

How much of
*The Gathering Storm*
is yours and how much is RJ’s?

#### Brandon Sanderson

“I’m not going to break it down at this time. Maybe after all three books are finished I’ll go into that. For now I can say that 100% of the book is RJ’s and 100% of the book is mine.” (He later repeated this at the signing with the added comment that if that didn’t add up correctly he didn’t care because he was an English major…to much laughter.)
