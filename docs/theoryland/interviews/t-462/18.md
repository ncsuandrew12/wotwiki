# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#18)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When asked why Justice (Artur Hawkwing's sword) was introduced at this point in the series, Brandon refused to answer, saying it was not even certain that Justice had been introduced, and thus he could not say either way without spoilering.

#### Footnote

It was confirmed by Brandon
[in an email](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/51901-tgs-signing-tour-qa-plot-related/)
that Rand's new sword is Justice.
