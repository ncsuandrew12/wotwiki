# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#33)

#### Question

You mentioned a clue that occurred in books 4-6. What can you tell us about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon mentioned that he isn’t on the web constantly so he can’t state for certain whether or not it has been discussed. However he doubts very strongly that it has ever been discussed at length. That being said he did say that he was ‘very surprised’ that it hasn’t been discussed. Basically he thought it more important than ‘who killed Asmodean”.
