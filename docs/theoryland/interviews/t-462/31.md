# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#31)

#### Question

Do Rand and Egwene’s timelines end up at the same time at the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
? Secondly, can you give us some idea as to when that is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Yes they end up at the same time. I’ll have to give you a MAFO for an exact date for the second, but basically it is sometime in late June early July." In addition Tuon’s scene with Rand was about 3 or 4 weeks before her last scene in the book.

A relatively long discussion of timelines followed. Basically RJ would have the timeline within a story arc follow chronologically but “Jim was crafty” when it came to the overall timeline. Maria has a huge spreadsheet of a timeline but it is not publishable because it is very rough and unintelligible unless you’ve been working with it for a long time.
