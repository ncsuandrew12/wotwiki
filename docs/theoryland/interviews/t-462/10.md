# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#10)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When asked about the number of years between the Breaking and current day Brandon replied that it was well known and referred us to
[Encyclopaedia WoT](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/history/timeline.html)
, which is accurate except for a year here or there.

When asked if the timeline will ever be published, Brandon referred to a couple admirable efforts by fans, and Maria added that she tracks it with an Excel spreadsheet, but it would take a lot of effort to get it into a publishable format. Also, RJ was uncomfortable showing anyone his unpublished work and would go through a number of drafts, even if it was just for Harriet.
