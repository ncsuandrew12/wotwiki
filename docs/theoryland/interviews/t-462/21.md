# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#21)

#### Question

The next question was about the criteria that the Ajah Heads used to determine which sitters they sent to the rebels in Salidar.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Basically the Ajah heads had a small selection pool to start with. Their primary criteria were: a) loyalty to the Ajah Heads, would they do as they were told? b) would they be acceptable to the Aes Sedai in Salidar? c) finally did the Ajah Heads think they could be persuasive?

A comment was made about age, Brandon’s answer was to reiterate the limited nature of the Ajah Heads selection pool, the fact that most of the Aes Sedai Sitters that were sent were young was coincidental. He did go on to mention that the “too young Sitters” was a completely different matter.

He then went on to say which Sitters remain in power after reunification will be dealt with quietly. The most likely default will be who was Sitter/Head before the split.

#### Footnote

None of the Ajah plants in Salidar were notably young; this seems to have been a matter of confusion on the part of the questioner.
