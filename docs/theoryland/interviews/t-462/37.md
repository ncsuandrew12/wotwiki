# [Interview #462: TGS Signing Report - Old (Peter) Salt, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=462#37)

#### Old (Peter) Salt

After that question it was time to get our stuff together and walk down the Barnes and Noble on 17th St. for the signing. Well, most of us walked Harriet and Brandon took a cab appropriately enough.

As you can see our questions ranged all over the place but Harriet and Brandon and Maria were very gracious in answering all of them.
