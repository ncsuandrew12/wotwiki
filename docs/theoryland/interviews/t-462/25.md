#### Question

What first hooked you on (WoT)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As a young teen it was the Hero’s Journey. He also mentioned that the
*Eye of the World*
prologue was special, much different than the usual for that time which were “talky” overly drawn out. What kept him reading in later years was the depth of world building and all the embedded secrets.
