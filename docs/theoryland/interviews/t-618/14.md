# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#14)

#### Question

One thing I want to have is, after the
*Warbreaker*
annotations finish, next week is the last one, is to start putting up chapters of
*Mythwalker*
â€”

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, yeah... (groans) that book is bad.

But what I'd want... is like art annotations. Like for each of the Shallan things and then, Isaac's stuff, have Isaac write annotations for his art.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would be cool! The hi-res thing, and then that, that would be way cool. We also should start putting up some of the RPG art. I think they said we could do that so we might have to start putting up some of that. You know, drive people to look at the RPG.
