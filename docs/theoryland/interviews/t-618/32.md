# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#32)

#### Question

I have a question for both of you: with your writing, what is the most difficult thing and has it evolved as you've grown?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most difficult for me was to learn how to revise. I was not a natural reviser, and my books didn't start getting to publishable level until I learned actually how to do that. I didn't know how to take something good and make it better.

#### Peter Orullian

You know, I would say a lot the same. The other thing for me, early on was realizing that it's like any other thing that you do, that you have to practice. If you're a musician, you don't just sit down and play a concerto, and it's okay to do things badly. I like to tell people that you need to dare to fail spectacularly. I was told early on: don't try and write great big epic stuff. Don't try to write bestâ€” because bestsellers, when you get into the depths of publishing, 'bestseller' exists as its own genre. There are elements of what make a bestseller. And I've been told: don't try and write that kind of a book. And I ignored all of that. And what it meant was, I wrote a lot of stuff that I threw away. And that was the other thing that I learned: it's okay. You can write stuff and put it away. I think it's Heinlen that said, "The first million words don't count." It's all practice.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He just gave you very, very good advice.

#### Peter Orullian

So write a million words and then it's okay to feel like you should be publishing something. Till you hit a million words, it's okay.
