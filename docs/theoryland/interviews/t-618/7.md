# [Interview #618, Entry #7]: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#7)

#### Question

For
*Warbreaker*
you did awesome annotations, and I was wondering, are you going to do that with any of your other books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Warbreaker*
has, Mistborn has all the annotations. Yeah, if you go look them up. [To Peter:] We have annotations for
*Alloy of Law*
, right? (laughter) I did those? Did I send them to you? I'm pretty sure I wrote them. I don't have annotations for
*Way of Kings*
. The project was just too big to do that for at that point. I may eventually do them, but at this stage, there are not annotations for
*Way of Kings*
. But, there should be ones for
*Alloy of Law*
. And there are ones for all of the Mistborns.
