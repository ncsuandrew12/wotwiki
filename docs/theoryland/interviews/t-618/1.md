#### 17th Shard

REPORT: Signing with Brandon and Peter Orullian

Josh and Mi'chelle (Rubix and firstRainbowRose on the site) this month went to a joint signing with Brandon Sanderson and Peter Orullian, and gasp, now we have audio! We have about fifty minutes of questions and answers, including some interesting cosmere clues at the end. Isaac Stewart (interior artist for Mistborn and
*The Way of Kings*
) chimes in about some stuff he's done, with some info on the Feruchemical Table of Metals. There's a plethora of content. Mistborn video game info, film info, and exciting news for Alcatraz fans (at least, if you hate the covers that are there).

Audio is split up into three parts. Part One is the general Q&A from the signing, and has Brandon, Peter Orullian, and Isaac all fielding questions. If you like Peter's book,
*The Unremembered*
, there are some cool responses from him about that. There are, of course, Wheel of Time questions as well, but there seem to be an even number of questions for Wheel of Time as well as Brandon's own novels, too.

Part Two seems to be questions Brandon is fielding during the line, or after the line. I'm not totally sure, but there you have it.

Part Three involves Josh and Mi'chelle throwing some specific, in-depth cosmere questions compiled from the Ultimate List of Questions for Brandon as well as a few new ones. If you listen closely, you can tell that they are asking Brandon these in the parking lot of the bookstore, as Brandon and company decide where to eat dinner. Seriously. (Hey, it's not stalking if he says it's okay, right?) Ahem. It goes without saying that these questions have metric tons of spoilers for all of the cosmere! And if you don't know what that is, surf the wiki or General Theories. :P

Warning: our server sucks. I remember when we did
*The Way of Kings*
interview with Brandon, people (including me) couldn't download the large file in its entirety. Hopefully splitting it up in three files will minimize this issue, but if not, hey! We have transcripts! We attributed questions as well as we could. Major kudos to Chachel for transcribing this behemoth. Most of the editor's notes are mine.
