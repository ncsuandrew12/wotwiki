#### Question

Which main character is the most difficult for you to write or create?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the Wheel of Time or my own?

#### Question

In the Wheel of Time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the Wheel of Time, I would say getting Mat's voice right was the hardest. Because, Mat is so distinctive, and so... yeah. It's like he's funny in a specific way, though. Getting him right was probably the hardest. Second would be Aviendha.
