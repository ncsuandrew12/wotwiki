# [Interview #618, Entry #17]: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#17)

#### Question

So, Michael Whelan did the cover for
*The Way of Kings*
, and I read that Tom Doherty called him up personally and asked him to do it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, he did.

#### Question

Are there any plans for him to continue to do them, like Darrel K. Sweet has done for the Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's a very busy man. He said that, if it fits in the schedule, yes he will. But since we don't even have book two written yet, we donâ€™t know. He's my favorite artist, so that would be wonderful. But, we will see.
