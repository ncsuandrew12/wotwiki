# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#34)

#### Question

I was actually wondering where to get a Mistborn shirt like the one you’re wearing.

#### Isaac Stewart

I don't know if we actually sell these, but we do sell, my wife and I—

#### Brandon Sanderson

Isaac does my t-shirts.

#### Isaac Stewart

—we have a t-shirt website called
[InkWing.com](http://store.inkwing.com/)
and we also do monthly contests too—my wife has set up a blog and she does a contest and she gives away around three t-shirts a month. So yeah, just go there and we have a bunch of different things. There will be some more t-shirts.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And we link them all on my website, right?

#### Isaac Stewart

I think so, yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The
[store button](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/)
on my website. We'll eventually do a rebuild of my website where I'll make it easier to find things. But that's on the list, way down the list. We're all wearing kind of official swag t-shirts today. That's kind of cool. I'm wearing the Wheel of Time one and he's wearing a Theoryland one—you can't buy those because you have to be crazy to get one (laughter). Theoryland's a Wheel of Time
