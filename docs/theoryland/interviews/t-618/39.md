# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#39)

#### Question

Do you have any considerations for ever turning any of your works into a movie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I've sold rights on Alcatraz and those eventually lapsed. They had the option for three years. I've sold rights on Mistborn. That's still going strong. I've had inquiries about a couple of others. I can't say, though, because there's nothing sure. Though we did do the Mistborn video game and the handshake, is essentially a done deal now. We've just got to get the contract, fine details nailed down. Yes. Mistborn video game is a go. It's for sure.

#### Question

Tentative dates?

#### Brandon Sanderson

2013. Fall.

#### Question

Which company?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can't say that, though it is going to be cross-platform, all three major platforms, so PC, 360, and PS3. The plan right now is that it is going to be a prequel. (Everyone "oooohs") So it'll have new story and I'll be writing the story.

#### Question

Speaking of videogames, I don't know if you or anyone else here have noticed the similarities in the storyline of Fable III and Mistborn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, people have said that to me and I haven't played Fable III.

#### Question

It's really uncanny. Yours was written first, obviously, but going through it I was just like, "I wonder if he knows how parallel this runs."

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll have to play those.

#### Questioner

I can actually get you a copy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can get me a copy? Hey, get me copies! Yeah, hey, he works for Microsoft!

#### Questioner

For real.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay. I've got a 360. Epic Games sent me a 360 so I might as well play with it!

#### Question

Is that for the Mistborn...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I'm working with Epic on something else. I'll be able to announce that eventually, but Epic's got a studio in Salt Lake and so I've been working with them on something. But that's not official so I can't say anything about that.
