#### Question

Are they any new fantasy novels that you'd recommend?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, this year I've been reading pretty much exclusively Wheel of Time. Other than Wheel of Time I've only read three books. Two were Terry Pratchett books, and one was
*The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms*
, which is a really solid book. So,
*Hundred Thousand Kingdoms*
is a really good book. I... it's been nominated for the Hugo and for things like that so you don't need me to tell you that. But, yeah, that's the only one I've read. Oh. And
*Wise Man's Fear*
. But I started last year on that, I think, because I got that early. But really, I haven't read a ton this year because I've committed to rereading the whole Wheel of Time, and when you do that, your reading time just kind of vanishes and I also wanted to read for the Hugo awards, so I read all of their short fiction, for the Hugo awards, and so... I did vote.
