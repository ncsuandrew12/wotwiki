# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#19)

#### Question

Second question kind of goes to your
*Alloy of Law*
book. I was wondering: what was the inspiration for using Breezeâ€™s relative, and just kind of the time frame of the thing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There were a lot of inspirations for a lot of different things. You'll kind of have to wait until I post the annotations. I talk a lot about it in the annotations. Basically, I wanted, since we're jumping forward so far, I wanted there to be some roots in there of the series you already read and loved. And for those who have read the earlier series, there will be at least one Easter egg per chapter about things like that. If you haven't, I didn't want it to be a big deal that would keep you from reading the book, but I want a lot of that to be in there. And so, when other characters are mentioned you'll see the characters of the first three books become the mythology to the people there.
