# [Interview #618, Entry #48]: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#48)

#### Josh

Josh: Is Aona's Shard name Devotion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, but that's more of a "Email that question to me" because I would have to look at my computer to see which term I settled on, but you're basically there. [

#### Mi'chelle

We've got the right idea.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think it actually may be Devotion. So I'll have to look. It may be a synonym.

#### Josh

Is Skai Unity?

(Brandon seems confused by the pronunciation. It is apparently more like "Skae".)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, RAFO.

#### Josh

Passion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What? RAFO. I'm not going to tell you. You already kind of pulled out of me what Aona was.
