# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#36)

#### Question

Some of Robert Jordan's characters, the female characters especially, are very much alike. Are they similar to Harriet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, they're really not. He, when asked on tour which character was most like her, he said Bela (laughter). And this is what Harriet said, it's an indication of Harriet's sense of humor, the shaggy mare that just won't give up. No, she's really not much like them. She is like... imagine in your head your kindly, nice grandmother and mix her with a stately Southern belle, and that's Harriet. She's just very polite, kindly Southern grandmother.
