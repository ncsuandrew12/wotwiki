#### Question

This might seem kind of silly, but is there ever going to be a pronunciation guide for your work, perhaps? I argue with my brother on how the cities of Mistborn novels are pronounced.

I'm not so strict on pronunciation as some other authors are, because when I read books, I just pronounce things however I want in my head, and then I ignore what they said, how they should be pronounced. I can't do that anymore with Wheel of Time. Fans are like, wait a minute, Robert Jordan said it, and I say, "oh, I mean...". Though I once got Harriet and Maria—who is Robert Jordan's assistant—into an argument about how Robert Jordan said one of the names. So even they can't get them all right. Maybe eventually... there is one for

names are easy, though. That's mostly predictable. Yeah, the Aons.
