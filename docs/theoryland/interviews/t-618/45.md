# [Interview #618, Entry #45]: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#45)

#### Question

I'm relatively new to fantasy. For the Mistborn series, I'm curious: do you find out the origins of Ruin and Preservation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

...Eventually, eventually. You should talk to these guys. (signals to 17th Sharders) They'll talk your ears off, and then some. Eventually perhaps you will.

#### Mi'chelle

(laughter) Liar!

#### Questioner

But not yet.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, they know
*some*
things.

#### Mi'chelle

Miâ€™chelle: Just go to 17thshard.com and plan a LOT of time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They've got big theories because all my books are connected, so yes. They have lots of theories talking about that.

Last question.
