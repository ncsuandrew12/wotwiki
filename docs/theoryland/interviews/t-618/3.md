# [Interview #618, Entry #3]: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#3)

#### Question

The first question is cut off. Mi'chelle believes the question is: How epic is the Last Battle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I guess it depends on your definition of 'epic'. I mean, it feels pretty epic to me. There's a lot of stuff going on in this book. I hope people don't get lost, is what I'm worried about. I mean, everything is kind of coming to a head. I can't say much, but it's pretty epic.

#### Question

For the Last Battle how many points of view are you doing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm using a lot of them. There's going to be all the mainstays. Rand will get viewpoints again. Perrin, Mat, Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne. And there will be some Tuon, and then there will be some little shots from all over the place. The Great Captains will all be involved, so you'll be seeing from them. You'll be seeing from pretty much everybody. I'm trying to give at least one little scene from them if we've had a major perspective [from them], we'll try to do some from them. But, you know, the core is going to be the main characters. So: the Two Rivers guys and the Wonder Girls, basically, if you follow the parlance from the websites.
