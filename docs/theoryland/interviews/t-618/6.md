#### Question

Is there any iconography planned for the Twelve Heralds? [
*Editor's note: he means Ten.*
]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Like in what specific way?

#### Question

Images of them as the (indistinguishable)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's already some in the book. Front cover. Look at the corners.

Maybe eventually. The thing is, the Heralds are... they're mythological figures of lore. So what you'll see are things like that. Those are actually large representations of them in the archways.

#### Question

I remember reading about statues.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there are statues, and so maybe eventually you will get some drawings from Shallan regarding things like that. We'll see. It's a good question, though.
