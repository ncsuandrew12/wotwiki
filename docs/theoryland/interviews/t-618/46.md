# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #46](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#46)

#### Question

It's actually not a question. It's: thank you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh! My pleasure.

#### Questioner

I follow you on Facebook and that really helps. Thank you. It makes you real.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My pleasure. Yeah, follow me on Facebook or on Twitter, I try to post at least one thing a day. Often I'm posting more. Some of them are stupid. Some of the things are dumb things my kid does, but I also do updates on writing and things like that.

#### Questioner

I would have to disagree. You've never posted anything stupid! Thank you very much.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you guys very much for reading!
