# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#28)

#### Question

Just real quick: the short that's in the RPG, the short story. Is that ever going to be available outside the RPG?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe eventually. The idea is that we gave it to them exclusively for a certain period; I don't know how long the period is. It's probably a couple of years. The idea being: the short story is there as a goodie for the RPG. You know, the RPG guys, RPGs are not big sellers. These are an independent company making it because they love it. It's not their day job. They all have other day jobs. Though, we wanted to put something in there that would attract people's attention to look at it and be interested in it. They will eventually, probably be available elsewhere. If you can read other languages, it'll probably be in the translations of
*Alloy of Law*
. But that's only if you want to read it in translation.
