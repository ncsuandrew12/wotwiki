# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#44)

#### Question

Are there any author's skills that you envy, besides Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah! (laughter) No, there are. There are things that Pat Rothfuss does that I think are wonderful. Mostly, his poetry of language, that, I envy his ability to do that. Jim Butcher's ability to pace is just fantastic, and so, I look at him and say, wow, I want to have the ability to pace like that. You know, there are a lot of authors that write really good books that I look at and say, wow, I want to learn from that. And then you do, because that's what you do as a writer. You're like, I learned from this.
