# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#58)

#### Mi'chelle

I know that you've answered this before, but we don't have citation yet. Was the earthquake caused by Odium's visit to Elantris? You've answered that one before, I believe.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don’t know if I have. I think I’ve given implications without a strict, direct answer on that one.

#### Mi'chelle

And what are the implications, so I can know if I'm thinking of the right answer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What do you think I've said?

#### Mi'chelle

I think you've said, no it isn't.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Seons existed before the earthquake.

#### Mi'chelle

But was the earthquake caused by Odium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When Odium visited there were no Seons.

#### Josh

Okay.

#### Mi'chelle

But that doesn't answer the question about the earthquake, so that's interesting to note.

#### Brandon Sanderson

See what I'm saying?
