# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#12)

#### Question

This is for Isaac, actually. What are you working on right now? Are you working with anything with Brandon or with someone else?

#### Isaac Stewart

Yeah, I am. (To Brandon: can I tell them about the Feruchemical—? Brandon: Yeah.) I just finished a version of the Feruchemical table. If you’ve seen the Allomantic table, it's very similar to that. New frames. I actually created it a different way, and I think it looks nicer than the other one. It makes me want to go back and redo the other one (laughter) but it also has new symbols and some new information.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That'll debut in the Mistborn RPG, and then we'll sell prints.
