# [Interview #618: West Jordan Signing Report - 17th Shard, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=618#27)

#### Question

Do you have any plans to write any type of science fiction...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've got lots of ideas but I have no plans in the near future. I have done one military science fiction coauthored with my buddy Ethan Skarstedt, my buddy in the military. We'll see if that ever coalesces into a book that we can ever publish. We did write a cool military SF together. Nothing big, epic science fiction. I've got enough on my plate right now.
