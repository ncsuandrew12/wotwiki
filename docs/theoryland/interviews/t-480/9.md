#### Amalisa

Has Egwene's Dream of having her head on a block and an axe falling come true?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon answered, It has not; she is still in danger of that happening. Then he looked at us and said, "It may, or may not also have something to do with Min's vision of Gawyn either saving or killing Egwene." Big smile on his face for that one.

#### Samadai

Great job Amalisa, you received the correct Question bonus.
