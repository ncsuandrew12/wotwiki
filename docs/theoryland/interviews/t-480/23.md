# [Interview #480: TGS Signing Report - Samadai, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=480#23)

#### Samadai

We all thanked him profusely for his time (20-30 minutes). Forkroot and I told him we thought he did a great job and we couldn't think of another person who is more suited to finishing the books. We said goodbye to the others, Forkroot and I shook hands and we went home (Forkroot, I am very sorry I didn't offer you a ride to your hotel).

I forgot to put this up there but while BWS was signing, the Storm Leaders were walking around giving out cool things. I got three bumper stickers, "I killed Asmodean", "Bela is a Darkfriend", and the WoT symbol. Also a map of Randland, a bookmark, and two flyers, one for a writer's conference with BWS in Los Angeles, and the other for JordanCon 2010.

I promised pictures and will get them on here but I can't do them here at work. So after I get home I will put them here.
