# [Interview #480: TGS Signing Report - Samadai, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=480#18)

#### SteelBlaidd

Did Egwene squeeze Moghedien for information on the Dream World?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was our First MAFO (Maria And Find Out).

He also said that Egwene is a powerful Dreamer and it seems unlikely that she didn't squeeze her for the information.

#### [MARIA SIMONS (VIA LUCKERS)](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/48825-my-plot-related-qa-with-maria-simons-new-mafo)

This one is basic enough that I feel pretty confident that Egwene would have certainly asked Moghedien about
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Egwene threatened to execute Moghedien if she lied; I would think that with the knowledge that Egwene gained from the Aiel Wise Ones she might use that as the occasional test, and see where it went. I think that Egwene asked Moghedien about pretty much anything that popped in her head.

#### FOOTNOTEâ€”LUCKERS

Maria claims the right to amend this later.
