# [Interview #480: TGS Signing Report - Samadai, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=480#6)

#### Samadai

The question segment ended and Brandon sat down to start signing books. I was talking to several people around me when I heard, 'Is there a poster named Samadai from Tor.com here?' Needless to say I was shocked to hear someone announce that, I turned around raised my hand and said, "that's me". Well the Powell's book store worker said to me, "well we have Forkroot from Tor.com right over here." I looked over to see him waving at me, he came over and told me how he ended up there (which he talked about in his posting). As forkroot mentioned we also collected a gathering of people to talk to.

They called the ticket holders up 10 people at a time and so I was in the third group of people near the end of the line #28. When I was at the front of the line I introduced myself to Brandon. I told him my screen name at Tor.com said I heard He at met Freelancer at another signing, he remembers you. I then mentioned that we all had come of with some more questions for him and were wondering if he had time. He told me to stick around to the end and he would spend some time with us (I told him about Forkroot as well). Done with my time, I went back and hung out with Forkroot and the others, where we discussed all the same things we all discuss on here. Forkroot then had his turn. After he was done there were a few more people, and then the Storm Leaders had the picture and signings. Forkroot and I had our picture taken with Brandon, then we all went outside after profusely thanking the Powell's store staff, and enviously thanking the Storm Leaders.

Out in front of the store, Forkroot, myself and a couple of our new friends gathered around Brandon. Forkroot asked his questions first which he already posted

. Then we got down to the questions that you guys gave me.
