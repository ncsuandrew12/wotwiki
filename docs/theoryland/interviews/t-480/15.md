# [Interview #480, Entry #15]: TGS Signing Report - Samadai](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=480#15)

#### TheWindRose

Are there any Forsaken around Elayne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon paused for a moment, then said: So many people are trying to figure out where Demandred is, I am not sure I can answer that.

#### Samadai

Forkroot and I both said no, not Demandred. We were talking Cyndane or Moghedien. Then we said, for example, some postulate that Sylvase is Cyndane.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said, "No, Sylvase is not a Forsaken and was never intended to be."
