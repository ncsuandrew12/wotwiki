# [Interview #480, Entry #5]: TGS Signing Report - Samadai](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=480#5)

#### Samadai

I then asked, has Demandred's alter ego been seen since
*Crossroads of Twilight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that is a good question, but "I'm not going to answer it."

#### Samadai

I actually asked this next question after the signing but since it is relevant to this question I am putting it here. I asked, has Demandred's alter ego been mentioned in the books but not seen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He gave me a very guarded look and said, "That is a very well though out question", paused for a moment, and said "there have been too few characters introduced in the last few books for me to answer that". Speculators unite.
