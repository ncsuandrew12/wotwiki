# [Interview #480: TGS Signing Report - Samadai, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=480#1)

#### Samadai

Hey everyone, I think my words per post count is going way up.

So here is my report from
*The Gathering Storm*
book signing last night in Portland, OR.

First off Powell's book store is enormous. It is roughly three times as big as my local Barnes and Noble/Borders stores. It is by far the biggest book store I have been in in my life. And it isn't even the biggest in Portland; its downtown store I'm told covers an entire block, is 5 stories tall (I believe that is what I was told) with a parking garage on top.

I arrived at about 5:30 and was about the 30th person there (one of the gentlemen I ended up talking to most of the night had been there since 10:00am). Another girl had driven 600 miles from central Idaho to come to the signing. Her father had come with her and walked up to Brandon and thanked him for making his daughter's night. Brandon got up and shook both their hands.
