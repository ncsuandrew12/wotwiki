# [Interview #783, Entry #6]: JordanCon 2010 - blindillusion](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=783#6)

The only other discussion I attended was "Moiraine, nuff said". Much of the discussion, that I got to hear at least, dealt with how cool Moiraine is and how she treats others with respect, which is why they treat her that way.

But there is one element of the discussion I'd like to kick up here on TOR, though perhaps in the Open Thread. One of the attendees put forth the comment that Moiraine is a "Damsel in Distress" and that this makes Moiraine less cool/cheapens her character.

I actually raised my hand to make the comment of how can she be a damsel in distress as she's stuck in the Tower with no way out, which as some pointed out, does make her such =). But my comment was more of a, "How does that take away from her coolness?" Yes, she's waiting to be rescued, but still.

Right after that, though, I had to go because my son was getting upset. Also, I met R.Fife while waiting for that discussion to start. And I recorded this discussion on my phone, so if anyone would really like me to try to hear it and write a real re-capâ€”I'll try to find the time.

Other than that, I attended BWS's reading. It started with a Q&A with Harriet. And, as J.D has already stated, BWS then read from
*The Way of Kings*
.

Oh, yeah,
