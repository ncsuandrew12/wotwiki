# [Interview #783: JordanCon 2010 - blindillusion, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=783#2)

#### blindillusion

Is there any way for someone to be removed completely from the Pattern?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Sorry I cannot put out his precise words, but here is the gist)â€”Jordan started by having balefire do this, but he later debunked this theory by saying someone killed by balefire can be reborn at some point. We currently know of nothing/no method that will completely remove someone from the Pattern.

#### blindillusion

I thanked him and turned to walk away at this point, so that he could continue with the signing. But he called me back and commented that:

#### Brandon Sanderson

The wolves in the Wolf Dream. We know that in the Wolf Dream something can be completely removed from the Pattern.

#### blindillusion

(Again, not his exact words, but this pretty close. Perhaps J.D can back me up here. He was there.)

#### Footnote

Birgitte also said that death for the dead heroes in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
is permanent, but Brandon was writing
*Towers of Midnight*
at the time and he probably had Hopper on the brain.
