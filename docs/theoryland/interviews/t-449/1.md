# [Interview #449: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Housekeeping, Sam Weller's shipping, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=449#1)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Peter, Assistant to Mr. Sanderson, here again with an update. I'll probably be doing this a bit in the next few weeks while Brandon is on tour, since he's spending every decent stretch of time not signing books either sleeping or working on
*Towers of Midnight*
. I hope he'll be able to chime in from time to time, but if not, he's at least posting quick status updates on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Mistborn)
(many of them about where to find signed booksâ€”he's not just signing books in the official tour stores, but in any bookstore he happens to pass along the way, including airport bookstores).

Quick update on the Sam Weller's signed and numbered copies that 493 of you ordered. They started shipping them out last Thursday and the books started being delivered on Tuesday. But unfortunately after five days of shipping books and getting over 80% of them out the door, the US Post Office suddenly balked at the way the books are packaged (even though they didn't say a word the previous five days or every other time Sam Weller's has done virtual signings for Brandon). So a bit fewer than 20% of them had to be repackaged (Sam Weller's is picking up the tab for the difference in shipping cost) and didn't make it out the door until yesterday or today. If you're still waiting for your book to arrive, Sam Weller's apologizes profusely and we all hope you get your book soon.
