# [Interview #687: Mormon Writers Symposium: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=687#14)

#### Kaimi Wenger

What are the limits of LDS fiction? Is there anything LDS fiction never do? Is this a good thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Limits of LDS fiction, or limits of LDS fiction, as published by the church? The church does and should have limits on what it will publish. (Which is why I think it's a conflict of interest for them to own the retail stores as well.) A book published by a Deseret Book imprint should maintain a certain standard of content. I don't think the church should have published Mistborn (though
*Elantris*
would have been just fine.) That doesn't mean I don't think LDS people should read it; it just means that I don't think it's right for that publisher.

I think other, smaller publishers can and are exploring other aspects of what it's like to live life as an LDS person. They will continue to do so. They may never hit the mainstream, but maybe—with time—we'll see mainstream LDS fiction expand beyond preaching. As I said above, I'm curious to see what happens.
