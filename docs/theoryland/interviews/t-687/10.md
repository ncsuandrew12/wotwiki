# [Interview #687: Mormon Writers Symposium: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=687#10)

#### Kaimi Wenger

Who are your favorite LDS authors? Why? What new things have you seen in LDS fiction in the last (30?) years that you've liked?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hum. . . . I'd list Robison Wells and Dean Hughes as two that I like who are publishing in the LDS market. If you talk LDS authors, but not necessarily LDS fiction, then I'd add Shannon Hale, David Farland, Orson Scott Card, and Brandon Mull to that list as well. I'll answer the second half of the question along with the next one. [Ed. note: Shannon Hale
[was interviewed a few weeks back](http://www.timesandseasons.org/?p=3871)
for this series.]
