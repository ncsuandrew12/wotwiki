Recently, there seems to have been a resurgence in the fantasy genre. The Lord of the Rings movies were quite successful; more recently,
*Eragon*
was in theaters. Are we going to see
*Elantris*
, the movie, any time soon? Who would you cast as Raoden? How about Sarene? Hrathen? (And is it too early to start looking around for actors for Vin, Kelsier, Vasher, Vivena . . . ?)

Ha! As for casting choices, I would direct curious parties to the threads on my forums about this topic. I can't really say who I'd pick, since it takes so long to make a movie. And, to be honest, I have trouble imagining ANY actor in my character roles. They are who they are in my head! An actor wouldn't be them to me.

Not that I wouldn't sell movie rights. Actually, we've had a few nibbles from various producers. As you've said, fantasy is hot. However, it's also very expensive to make a fantasy movie, so producers are wary about the projects they pick up. My kids' series,
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
, which starts this October with Scholastic, is probably the most likely to be made in the near future.
