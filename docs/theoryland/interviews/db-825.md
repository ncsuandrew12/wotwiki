## Entry #1

#### Andrea Lynn Leistra

For the fairly sizable contingent of Stanford rasfwrj-ites here, there's an RJ interview in the bookstore newsletter; I probably shouldn't post it here, but I found his last quote interesting enough to risk posting...

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan quickly points out, however, that the Wheel of Time is not literature in which everything always works out to fairytale perfection with good always triumphing over evil. "But," he adds, "I always try to leave hope at the end."

#### Andrea Lynn Leistra

That's an interesting little morsel; the rest is fairly unremarkable, singing the praises of WOT, an attempt at a two-sentence plot summary, a brief RJ biography, and the standard "I-don't-know-how-long-it-will-be" bit.
