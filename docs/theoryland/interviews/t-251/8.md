#### Question

Who is your favourite character? Have you got any favourite scenes?

#### Robert Jordan

My favorite character is always the one from whose point of view I am writing at the moment.
Most people like themselves to one degree of another, and to make the character believable, I have to like him or her, too. They are the star.
The favorite scenes work much the same way.
At least, when I write a scene and it doesn't feel as if it's my favorite, I keep going back to it to see if I can fix whatever is wrong with it.
