#### Question

Have your experiences in Vietnam helped to give a psychological depth to the Wheel of Time series?

#### Robert Jordan

I think they must have. I've certainly used some things from Vietnam.
I know what it is like to have someone trying to kill me. Me in particular. Not some random guy. Me.
I know what it is like to kill someone. I know how the first time feels, and how that is different from the fifth, or the tenth.
These things certainly went into the characters I've written.
That wasn't deliberate.
Who you are is constructed in large part from what you have experienced and how you reacted to those experiences. Whatever you write is filtered through who you are. So the influence has to be there.
