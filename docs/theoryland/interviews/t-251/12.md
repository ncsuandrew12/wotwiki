#### Question

The Wheel of Time will one day stop turning ... have you thought about what your next writing project will be?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, yes. I've already signed contracts for a fantasy trilogy entitled Infinity of Heaven, which I'll start on once the last book of the Wheel is done.
Aside from that, though, there might be two or three outrigger novels to the main story arc.
I've always said that I wouldn't write in this universe again unless I had a really great story idea, but I may have had one concerning some of the major characters and some lesser characters in a story outside the main story arc.
I have to poke at the notion for a year or so to see whether it really is strong enough, because I don't want to do those books just to be writing in this universe.
There are other places I'd like to explore.
The story I've laid out for Infinity of Heaven, for example.
