#### Question

Have there been any story lines or scenes you have to had to give up on because they were not working as you would have liked?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I haven't given up scenes or story lines for that reason.
I have abandoned scenes that I had planned on writing because I saw a more efficient or practical way of achieving the same end, though.
