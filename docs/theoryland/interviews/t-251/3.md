#### Question

Fantasy fans like to speculate about characters and plot lines in their favorite books. Have you ever picked up any ideas from reading fans' forums, FAQs or from the questions you have been asked?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I haven't. I've always known where I was going and what I wanted to do.
When I first discovered the fan websites and occasionally saw that someone had puzzled out correctly where I was going or what I intended to do, I thought about changing directions or altering the story to avoid what they had deduced.
I quickly learned, however, that as soon as anyone put up a theory on one of the sites, there would be at least one poster explaining why the theory was no good and even impossible for every poster who hailed it as the new Unified Field Theory.
So I didn't change anything after all.
