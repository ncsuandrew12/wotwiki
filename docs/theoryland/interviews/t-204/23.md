# [Interview #204: DragonCon Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#23)

#### Question

This is a question about
*The Great Hunt*
. When Mat and Perrin found out Rand could channel, Mat related a story to him he heard from a merchant guard in the Two Rivers about a male channeler who woke up and found his entire village smashed right around him except for the bed he was sleeping in. So, with regards to multiple personalities that a channeler can get like in Rand's case, is it possible for one of them to take over when the channeler falls asleep?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, you're...I can answer that question, but I realize in answering that question I am going to have to RAFO you, because I can't answer your question without telling you some stuff I don't want to tell you yet, sorry.
