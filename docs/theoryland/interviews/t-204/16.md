# [Interview #204: DragonCon Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#16)

#### Matt Hatch

Skipped [transcription of] question to Harriet about how Jordan may have tricked her in the past, as he has done to his readers about where he was going with something or another.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

She focused on two incidents when he tricked her with the books. She made a point about the 'Sword in the Stone' coming to her after having read the entire book. She didn't make the connection to Arthurian legend until she was writing the flap cover [of
*The Dragon Reborn*
].
