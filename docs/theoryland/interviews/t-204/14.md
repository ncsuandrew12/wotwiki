#### Question

I guess most of your Aelfinn and Eelfinn questions are RAFO, but could you tell us why it was they didn't consider Mat's silver dagger to be a weapon, silver is really iron?

#### Robert Jordan

Why the Finns didn't consider the dagger to be a weapon?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Robert Jordan
