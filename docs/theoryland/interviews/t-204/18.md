#### Question

Regarding the One Power, in a universal sense, like your physics background, is it more of a force like gravity would be, weak electromagnetic and strong electromagnetic, or is it something more of on a quantum level? Is it on a quantum level in your universe or is it a macro power?

#### Robert Jordan

I think you are going to have to think of it as being on a quantum level.
