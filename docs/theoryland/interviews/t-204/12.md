# [Interview #204: DragonCon Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#12)

#### Question

Mr. Jordan, if you could, I would like to know who built the Tower of Ghenjei. If you can't tell us that, is there any kind of detail you can share without compromising the future?

#### Robert Jordan

I am sorry this is a RAFO.
