# [Interview #204: DragonCon Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#24)

#### Matt Hatch

This is in reference to a
[previous question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=198#16)
I asked you about Parallel Worlds and Mirror Worlds, today I believe, and you mentioned they are different. And the question I had about Portal Stones was do Portal Stones lead to Parallel Worlds, Mirror Worlds, or both?

#### Robert Jordan

They lead to Mirror Worlds, the Portal Stones can take you to Mirror Worlds, not to Parallels, which are separate.
