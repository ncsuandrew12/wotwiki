# [Interview #204, Entry #4]: DragonCon Report - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#4)

#### Matt Hatch

Skipped [transcription of] question by Tamyrlin (the guy writing this transcript) to Harriet, sort of a joke about something previously mentioned by Jordan in another Q&A about male and female relationships.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet went on to say that RJ was the perfect man.

#### Robert Jordan

To which RJ responded that he is in fact the greatest embodiment of what women want in men. Jordan calls himself gullible, he says he believes anything women tell him, although he does mention he knows he is gullible in this way, so he is suspect of what women tell him. He then goes on to give a short piece of advice on how to make women happy. Rule #1 Make her laugh, Rule #2 Put the toilet seat down.
