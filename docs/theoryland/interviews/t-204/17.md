#### Isabel

Will Nynaeve be able to make
*cuendillar*
?

#### Robert Jordan

I doubt it, it is as much talent as it is strength. And I don't think she has that talent.

#### Isabel

And can men make
*cuendillar*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. But they wont use the same weaves the women use, so they will have to figure out how to do it themselves unless they can get it from one of the male Forsaken, if he happens to know it. It is an oddity that Moghedien even knew how to do this, it's just her fascination with things that are valuable.
