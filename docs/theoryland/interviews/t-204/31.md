# [Interview #204: DragonCon Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#31)

#### Matt Hatch

Skipped [transcription of] question: Asked Harriet how often she was RAFO'd.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Never she says, but she says she doesn't want to get it from him, she wants to read it, and so he says he doesn't tell her, because it would affect what she does as an editor. Harriet says she knows the general gist of the final scene of the last book in the series.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan jokes about RAFOing Harriet regarding the meal he wanted for dinner, RAFO.
