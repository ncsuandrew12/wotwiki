## [Entry #1](./t-374/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

First off, if you missed my
[big update of stuff](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/692/Back-from-DragonCon-with-Many-Updates)
, you might find some items of interest there.

I'm still recovering from Dragon\*Con. it was exhausting, but I was very glad that I went! I got to see a lot of great people, meet some old friends, and run into several groups I'd never met in person (that's you, GeorgaDawn and the LibraryThing folks.) I'll probably go again next year, if only because I feel I really NEED to bring my wife to this thing. She's been to Worldcon, but she really has no clue how truly bizarre some of this all can get. . . . ;)

## [Entry #2](./t-374/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I realized that during my previous update, I didn't do anything
*Alcatraz*
-related, so I figured I'd better update that side of things as well. I've gone ahead and transferred chapter one from its old place to the shiny
[new location in the Library](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/33/Alcatraz-Chapter-One)
. I'll be posting some sample chapters of
*Alcatraz*
Two in the upcoming months. For those of you who are fans of my epic fantasy, I really do suggest you look into
*Alcatraz*
when it comes out in paperback next month. I think you'll be pleased with what you find—think of one of my stories, only more lighthearted with a humorous slant on the magic system.

## [Entry #3](./t-374/3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've updated the percentage bar for
*A Memory of Light*
to reflect the work I did during the day before my departure to Dragon\*Con, my days back, and the time I spent in Atlanta when I managed to do some work on the book. I figured I should also update our comparison chart, so here you go:
