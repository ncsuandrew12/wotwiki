is a microcasting episode on these topics:

> Why do some authors only ever come out with one or two books?

> How do you avoid getting bogged down in explanation?
>   
> What happened to your Hero of a Thousand Faces episode? (Whoops! See below.)
>   
> Are there concerns or pitfalls regarding the use of metaphors and similes in genre fiction?
