# [Interview #867: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: YA Novels + AMoL 8:00 Q&A Map + Updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=867#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right now Harriet and I are busily pre-signing copies of
*A Memory of Light*
at the BYU Bookstore for tonight's midnight release. There were about 150 people in line this morning at 7:30 when the bookstore started handing out numbers and letting people go home and rest until this evening. Harriet will be going back to her hotel before the midnight release, but she will be at the reading/Q&A that is scheduled to start at 8:00 p.m. (doors open at 7:00) at the Provo High School Auditorium (map below)â€”repeat, the Q&A is NOT at the bookstore itself! The bookstore will open its doors around 10:30 p.m. and books will be handed out at midnight, after which I will do personalizations by book number order. Complete details are

. Hope to see many of you tonight!
