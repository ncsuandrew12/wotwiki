# [Interview #754: Kaffeeklatsch with Team Jordan - Ishara, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=754#4)

#### Ishara

There has been some discussion lately on the identity of the old man seen in Graendal's palace. Many of us believe that it was Jain Farstrider, the same man who wandered into the
*stedding*
all those years ago. But some have recently begun to think it could be Alsalam, as the descriptors are similar: older man, long hair etc. Can you confirm that the old man from the
*stedding*
and Graendal's palace are the same person: Jain Farstrider?

#### Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons

(They whispered to each other for a bit before they answered, we offered to put our fingers in our ears and hum...) It can't hurt to tell you allâ€”yes. It was Jain Farstrider.
