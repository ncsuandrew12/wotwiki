#### Matt Hatch

So, would it be possible to get a concrete definition of what the difference is between Shadowspawn and a construct?

#### Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons

Well...a construct doesn't have to be Shadowspawn. Someshta (the Green Man, a Nym) was a construct, and he was not Shadowspawn. But, no, we haven't got a list of which belongs to which category.
