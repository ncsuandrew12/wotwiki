Maybe I'm a bit ignorant here, but what is the motivation for a fascinating character like Wit/Hoid?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have always been impressed by masterworks like those done by King/Asimov, weaving multiple works by one author together into a single continuity. I felt that most authors who have done it didn't have the chance to start from the beginning intending to combine worlds. It is something that they decided upon after the fact. So, I thought I'd give it a try from book one.

I love stand alone novels, but I also love big epics. This was a way to let me have both at the same time with some of my works. And so, Hoid was born as a character plotting behind the scenes of my novels, connecting them together into a larger tapestry.

#### Kurkistan

Have you ever felt constrained by this commitment to consistency across the Cosmere, or does it amount to "limitations are more interesting than powers" as applies to own options as an author?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I feel it has always helped. If an idea doesn't fit into the limitations, I simply move it to a non-Cosmere story instead.
