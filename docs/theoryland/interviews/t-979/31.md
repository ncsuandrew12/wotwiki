If George R. R. Martin kicks the bucket before he finishes A Song of Ice and Fire, would you kindly do so in his place?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. Honestly, I'd be an AWFUL replacement for Mister Martin. My writing style is very different from his.

Let's just wish him to be in the best of health so he can continue to write the story that so many people love.
