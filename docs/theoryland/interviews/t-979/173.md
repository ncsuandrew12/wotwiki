Brandon, I'm a huge fan of
*The Way of Kings*
and met you at GenCon last year. Would you ever consider offering a license for a
*Way Of Kings*
Board Game or a Mistborn cardgame? It wouldn't take any of your time and we would give you full final approval on the game too. I gave you a couple of our games as well as my card but I know you are very busy and probably hit by this sort of request all the time.

I'd certainly consider it. (Did you email me too?) The trick is, I'm worried about jumping the gun on
*Kings*
licensing. I only have one book out in the series so far. I intend to be writing in this world for a while. I'd rather that a game come later, once more about the story/setting/characters is known so that the game is more true to the soul of the series.
