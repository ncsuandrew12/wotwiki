You've mentioned Spook being a bit of a 'stud' before, because I get oddly curious about this, how many children did he have?

A pretty weird question I know, but he does have a LOT of descendants.

and I love your writing and books so much, glad you're a non human writing machine :D

#### Brandon Sanderson

Spook has a lot of descendants, it's true. He had over a dozen children.
