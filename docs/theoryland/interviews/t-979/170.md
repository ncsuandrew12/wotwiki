What two books would you recommend to someone who hasn't read any of your books yet but is a huge reading especially in fantasy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say either Mistborn or
*Warbreaker*
. Mistborn (also called
*The Final Empire*
) is more action-oriented, and has the stronger magic system and plot.
*Warbreaker*
is more character and humor driven, and is a stand alone, rather than being part of a larger series.

Thanks!
