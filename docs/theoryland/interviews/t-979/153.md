Hay Brandon, Huge fan! Finished
*A Memory of Light*
, Re-read all 3 Mistborn for the 2nd time, re-read
*Way of Kings*
for the 4th time and am currently listening to
*Alloy of Law*
while I toil away at work. Also recently listened to all of season one of Writing Excuses, very cool stuff please keep doing it, maybe a live podcast from SDCC this year?

I also wanted to mention I met you last year at SDCC on preview night and I'm working on that Memento. http://i.imgur.com/tve4Xqv.jpg

To the questions...I believe I've heard you mention more than once that you weren't happy with
*Way of Kings*
, could you explain a bit exactly what you would change or love to do-over with it or expand on your comments?

Also, any teasers for the new Stormlight archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The problem with doing something live like that at SDCC is that it's really hard to get the space or work out the logistics. We keep talking about it, but have trouble making it happen. Everyone is just so BUSY there. But maybe!

The original draft of
*The Way of Kings*
had some big issues. One of the largest ones was that I was trying to do too many characters with too many separate plots. (Jasnah and Taln both had full sequences with as much complexity as the three main characters in the current draft.) Beyond that, Kaladin's character (he had a different name there) was bland and never worked. I needed to rebuild him from the start.

I'll post more explanations of this in the
*Kings*
annotations, which I'm working on right now. As for teasers for the second book, one of the interludes is from Taln's viewpoint. (He's the guy who shows up in the epilogue of the previous book.)
