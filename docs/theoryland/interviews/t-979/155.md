Hey Brandon, love all of you work and so does everyone I give them to. Keep up the good work.

Which of your protagonist characters do you dislike the most as a person? Taking into account that you know all of their inner secrets and motivations.

On the flip side. Which of your antagonists do you connect with the most? The Lord Ruler seems an obvious choice as he was misunderstood by everybody for so long. But still, I'm curious.

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is a tough one, as while I'm writing, I HAVE to like everyone. However, the most disturbing of them is probably Kelsier. He's a psychopath—meaning the actual, technical term. Lack of empathy, egotism, lack of fear. If his life had gone differently, he could have been a very, very evil dude.

Elend. I see myself as an idealist like him.
