Knowing what you know about Shai'tan, would it have been possible or at all interesting to have had a part from his POV?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anything is possible, but I don't think it would be right for the book. Even in 'What if' land. Putting in a recreation of him was even a stretch—anything you read in the books is how mankind's minds choose to visualize him. He doesn't really have a personality. He, like the Pattern, simply IS.
