What fantasy or science fiction authors do you consider underrated? Got any recommendations for us?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow. Lots. I doubt many of these are truly underrated on a place like /r/fantasy, but they sometimes don't get the sales I feel they deserve. Guy Gavrial Kay is one of these. (He has a new book out, and did an AMA recently.) You're probably familiar with him, but I would put him and Pratchett as the best two things in fantasy right now.

Melanie Rawn's sunrunner books are some of my classic favorites, and not as well known by many modern readers.

*The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms*
and its sequels are just plain awesome.

Daniel Abraham's works are very good. He's more well known now than he once was.
