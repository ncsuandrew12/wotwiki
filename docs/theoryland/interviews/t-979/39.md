I was wondering something about the Stormlight Archive. You have said before that an upcoming book will be
*The Highprince of War*
. Will this definitely be Dalinar's book, or could this be referring to a subsequent Highprince of War (like Dalinar's sons?). And a quick side question: how is book 2 coming along? Can we still hope for a late 2013 release?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Book two has been renamed
*Words of Radiance*
, as it's Shallan's book. Dalinar's book will be Book Five. (Though I haven't promised he will survive that long. I reserve the right to do flashbacks for someone in a book after they have died.)

It WILL be Dalinar's book, however, not one of his sons.

Late 2013 is still possible. I'm about 2/3 of the way done.
