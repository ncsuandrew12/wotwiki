Hi Brandon,

First of all, just wanted to say that I love your work. I got hooked with
*Elantris*
and have felt the need to purchase all your other books as a result. Also, fantastic job with handling the WoT series!

I'm curious on your thoughts regarding the self-publishing market. I've always had an interest in writing fiction and have finally completed my first novella. As a person with a full-time job, I'm seriously considering self-publishing rather than finding an agent to represent me, and attempting to market through the internet.

So, how do you feel about the self-publishing route, rather than the publisher-agent-writer trifecta?

I think self-publishing is a perfectly viable option these days, and has many things to recommend it. For a novella in particular, it can be one of the best ways to get your work out there.

I cover some of the differences in depth, by my perspective, as one of the latter writing lectures at WriteAboutDragons. (Those are videos a grad student posted of my lectures for a class project he's working on.)

The long and short is, however, that I think you are wise to consider both options. If I were breaking in right now, I'd probably try both methods.
