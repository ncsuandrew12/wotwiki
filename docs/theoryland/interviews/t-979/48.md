I just started listening to
*The Way of Kings*
on audiobook with my wife! Did you get any input on how the production/casting/pronunciation went on it? Or is that entirely out of your hands?

I am of a level in the field now that I can ask for certain readers, and I did so with
*The Way of Kings*
. I do try to send in pronunciations, but sometimes this gets lost in the shuffle.
