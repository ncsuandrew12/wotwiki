# [Interview #979: Reddit AMA 2013, Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=979#43)

Why did Mat's death break the bond with the Horn when his death was reversed with balefire? Wouldn't it also reverse the breaking of the bond?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is one where I just let Team Jordan lead. They told me why the bond had been broken, and that the other death didn't count. It was straight from RJ's mouth, but was not included in the notes, so we just had to work with what we had.
