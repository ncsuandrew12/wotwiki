I just finished
*A Memory of Light*
about a week ago, I've been wondering...whatever happened to Morgase? She was never mentioned in the prologue when Talmanes was fighting through Caemlyn, nor was she around when Elayne found out what happened to Caemlyn. Did she just die during the initial strike by the Darkfriends/Black Ajah?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She lives. She spend some time helping the refugees; I may have mentioned it, or I may have forgotten. One challenge with this last book was finding a place for so many characters. Some, like Morgase, I decided to deal with in previous volumes and leave only brief mentions in the final book.
