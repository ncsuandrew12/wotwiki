I just wanted to say that
*Towers of Midnight*
saved my life. Literally. I figured that if I were going to kill myself, I should at least finish up this book. By the time I was done, I A) had gotten enough help that I no longer wanted to die and B) was really looking forward to the next one.

The characters of the Wheel of Time had been my oldest friends for half a lifetime. I couldn't just abandon them, you know?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow. I don't know what to say other than that. I'm glad you got the help you need, my friend. Depression is a pernicious beast. I wish you the best.

Thank you for sharing this, and I know exactly how you feel about the characters.
