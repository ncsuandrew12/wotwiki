You've got a reputation for pumping out tons of content. How much time do you spend writing every day? Do you have any tricks for keeping yourself on task?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hi, Brian. Good luck with the book launch!

I write about 2,500 words a day, writing at around 500 words an hour. My production is more about being consistent than about being fast. I do tend to write around ten hours a day. Don't know if I have any tips other than to perhaps turn off the internet or go outside and write for a while.

EDIT: Posted a little bit of clarity on the 2,500 words a day, and what I do with the rest of the time, below.

If you write about 500 words an hour and write for 10 hours a day? Isn't that 5000 words a day?

I see that doing good at math isn't very important as an author. ^ ^

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. I should have been clear. You're absolutely right to point this out.

I spend a large amount of time each day answering email, working on the wiki for my worlds, planning new books, and revising. Many days, I actually do around 3500 words, but the average tends to be closer to 2500 or even 2000 once editing and everything is factored in.
