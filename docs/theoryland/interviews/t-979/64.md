Would you ever expand on
*The Alloy of Law*
? I loved the ending, it made me want even more.

Speaking of
*Alloy of Law*
... To me it felt paced like a good movie. I feel like it would make a super fun movie. Just wanted to say that.

Keep being awesome!

Ooh! I can answer this one. The sequel to
*Alloy of Law*
is called
*Shadows of Self*
. As far as I know, there hasn't been a date specified on when it'll come out since it's unwritten, but the best fan guess is sometime in 2014.

I agree on the movie thing. It's like Lethal Weapon with allomancers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

As the other person wrote, I will be doing more. Thanks for reading!
