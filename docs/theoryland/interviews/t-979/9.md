You're obviously known for your creative and unique magic systems, and magic-centric stories. How often do you have the urge to write works that don't involve any magic at all? Have you done this in the past and they've gone unpublished?

It depends on if you count the vague 'science' of a soft science fiction as magic. If you look at something like "
[Firstborn](http://www.tor.com/stories/2008/12/firstborn)
" or
*Legion*
, there are only faint magical elements. However, since I'm not a hard SF writer, they are there.

I'd say that once in a while, I feel myself wanting to write something along those lines—but I've never had an idea that wasn't at least marginally sf/f that screamed at me to write it. What can I say? It is the wonder and the imagination of sf/f that made me into a reader in the first place. Whatever idea I come up with, I find that adding some speculative fiction elements makes me more excited about it.
