Could you explain what the deal is with the Great Serpent? I was half-expecting it to appear in the middle of the big showdown at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
. Is it just a different metaphor for the Wheel?

Did we ever meet the Creator in the series? If so, who?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll preface this with a warning. Even though the series is done, and I can speak more freely, some things are intended to be vague by RJ's own intention. This allows dreaming and thinking about the world to continue. For example, I can't answer question 2 for these reasons. For question one, I think RJ himself was vague. (Maybe a Theorylander can speak here.) This isn't one I'm capable of answering, because I don't want to make an answer canon one way or another, as I don't think RJ wanted that.
