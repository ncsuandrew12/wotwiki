I'm rereading
*Way of Kings*
and I had a question about the Parshendi, do they have a negotiating form? I ask because it seems that they must have shifted forms before/just after the betrayal and are now stuck in war form, but if they had the ability to negotiate before why not now?

More of this will be answered in book two. They aren't 'stuck' in warform, but do have limited options.
