You've said you want to write a book set in the southern continent. I did enjoy
*The Emperor's Soul*
a lot, so I am curious about you writing that future book. How do they use magic differently, and why should we be excited about reading a book set there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The southern continent is where people have discovered how to harness the metallurgic arts in a more mechanical method. (I've hinted several places that this is possible. I've been holding off doing it until we go here.)

#### Nepene

Ooh, cool, ferugolems? Do you have any hints for us where we should look for these hints of how you can use it in a mechanical fashion? I haven't reread the Mistborn books in a while.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The hints are things I've said in interviews, not so much in the stories. (Sorry for not being clear about this.)

#### Chaos2651

About the southern continent, would it be possible for other Scadrians to discover this method of using the Metallic Arts, or is it unique to the southern Scadrians?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is technology-based rather than genetics based.
