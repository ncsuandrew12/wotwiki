Mr. Sanderson! I just picked up Mistborn over the weekend. It'll be my first of yours. Planning on starting it as soon as I finish Pat Rothfuss'
*The Wise Man's Fear*
. Greatly looking forward to it.

Also, I'm a Utah local. I'd love to take a class from you at some point in the future (though I am not a BYU student).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Cool! Hope you enjoy the book.
*Wise Man's Fear*
is excellent. I'm jealous of the sheer beauty of Pat's narrative.
