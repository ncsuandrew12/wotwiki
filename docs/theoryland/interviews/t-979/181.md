Not sure if this question has already been posted. Which author would you say has influenced your writing the most? From deciding to be an author to making you write like you do. You are my favorite author right now and therefore what made you decide to start and to have the style of writing that I so love.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's really hard to judge the MOST influential.
*Dragonsbane*
by Barbara Hambly was the book that got me into fantasy, and the Dragonriders of Pern books kept me there. My favorite classic is
*Les Miserables*
. Tad Williams, Robert Jordan, and Melanie Rawn were very influential on me during my early years as a writer.

My style came as a mix of many of the things I was reading, as a reaction against some elements—and toward others. Brent Weeks, I've noticed, has a very similar style to my own, particularly in his Lightbringer books. I believe we're both products of the same era and books.

Did you read any Steven Brust? He's got a recurring character who cameos in every book, and a repeated number with great mystical significance (17, not 16). And, of course, lots of snarky conversations.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't read as much Brust as I should, but what I have read has been excellent.
