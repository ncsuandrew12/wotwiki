There's a number of your early works like
*White Sand*
and
*Dragonsteel*
which haven't actually been published. What's your take on them? Will they eventually be published? Are they fine to read, or are they effectively spoilers for plot elements you might reuse in other books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

*White Sand*
is fine to read—it is part of the shared universe of my books, and I will eventually be writing it. It's not a terrible book, but not fantastic either. If you email me, I'll send it to you.
*Dragonsteel*
, however, has some major spoilers for various books, and I prefer not to send that one to people quite yet.
