Whose writing has impressed you lately and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lately, I've been trying to find time to finish Brian McClellan's book. (I feel embarrassed I haven't done so yet.) But MAN that kid can write. He's great with the turn of a phrase and with the 'punch you in the gut' moments of good storytelling.
