When you took over writing the Wheel of Time series, was there anything that RJ had in his notes that just completely surprised you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmm... The scene where Egwene gets a specific visitor in
*The Gathering Storm*
surprised me the most, I think. Also, at the end of
*Towers*
where Moiraine and Thom get engaged. I hadn't noticed how strong the clues about those two were.
