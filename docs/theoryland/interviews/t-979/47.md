Given how George R.R. Martin got Game of Thrones to come out on a TV format, if you had to choose one of your series to receive a similar exposure to television, which would you choose and why?

(For fanboy's sake I'll also include the option for Wheel of Time, R.I.P. Robert Jordan)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would most certainly pick the Wheel of Time. I've been very straightforward with Universal in stating my preference that WoT be adapted for television, as opposed to the big screen. Both could be awesome, but I think the long form of a season would be better for the books.

After WoT, I'd pick
*Legion*
, which I envisioned as a show even as I wrote it.

#### Zdus

I see having the WOT becoming a series would be awesome if it is taken care of, for example the The song of Fire and Ice series on HBO. It would be unfair to Robert Jordan if it turns out like The Sword of Truth series did in the form of
*Legend of the Seeker*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that's the danger with the TV series route. I certainly wouldn't want to see that happen.
