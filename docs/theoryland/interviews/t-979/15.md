In
*Warbreaker*
Lightsong mentions that the Returned's forms are dependent on contemporary beauty standards. In
*The Emperor's Soul*
Shai implies that if others did not find the Emperor's Soul plausible it would not take as well. Is my reading of their statements correct, is their magic dependent on how others view you as well as how you view yourself?

#### Brandon Sanderson
