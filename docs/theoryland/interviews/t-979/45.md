You have said the Scadrians on the southern continent does have interaction with the Metallic Arts, but use them in very different ways. Does this mean there are different, for example, Allomantic abilities for those Scadrians? Or is it more a cultural thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The abilities are the same. The way they harness and use them, though, is different...
