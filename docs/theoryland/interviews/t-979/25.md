What is your favorite scene from any of your books that you've written?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Boy...favorite scene? That's going to be tough, as anything about my books plays into the "which of your children do you like the most" mentality that authors have. It's hard to choose.

I would say either Raoden finally gaining his Elantrian powers at the end of
*Elantris*
, since it was the first scene like that I ever managed to pull off in a book, or the final Lan/Demandred sequence at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
. I had planned that one for five years, and was pushing toward it all through my work on the Wheel of Time.
