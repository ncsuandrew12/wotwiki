Hey Brandon, just one question I have.

Why didn't you continue with
*Warbreaker*
as a series? Seriously the best characters you have made are in that book IMO (though I haven't read
*Elantris*
yet, I've read everything else you have made).

#### Brandon Sanderson

The primary reason is because the story doesn't cry for an immediate sequel, while
*Way of Kings*
did. That forces me to prioritize Stormlight. But I will eventually get to another
*Warbreaker*
book.
