You're turning out often huge books with alarming regularity while still managing to make appearances, sign books, record a podcast, teach others, have a family, and possibly patrol the streets in costume by night. I feel accomplished if I manage to write a couple of thousand words
*and*
eat a solid meal in a day.

YOU HAVE FOUND ME OUT!

Honestly, I just love what I do, so I find excuses to do it instead of other things. That's only secret there is to it. However, if you are doing a couple thousand words in a day, you're keeping up with me. Don't sweat it. Keep writing at your own pace, and enjoy the process.
