If you had a time machine, where would you travel to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Learn Hebrew. Go listen to Jesus. Get free bread and fish. After that, forward in time to get myself a flying car.

#### yuukanna

Not to be "That Guy" (as I am also a fan of your works), but Jesus likely spoke Aramaic.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. Well, that's probably the language of his sermons, so I guess I would need that one too. And probably Greek, just to be careful.

Man. Owning a time machine is tough work.
