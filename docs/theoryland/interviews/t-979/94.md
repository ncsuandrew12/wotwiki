How have
*Eye of the World*
/Mistborn sales been ever since
*Game of Thrones*
hit it big? Has the interest in
*Game of Thrones*
garnered more exposure of the fantasy genre?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's hard for me to answer this one because there are too many factors influencing my sales right now. New Wheel of Time books, for example. You'd be better finding if something that has been out for a while, but hasn't had new books in a little while, has done better. (Maybe something like the Belgariad or Thomas Covenant.)
