Hey Brandon. Just now finding out about this AMA so I don't know if you will answer this but I really must know something.

I'm just wondering if you still plan on doing a sequel to
*Warbreaker*
one day. I just want to say that Vivenna was my favorite character and had my favorite arc. I remember you saying in the annotations that you were worried that people would be disappointed with a sequel starring Vivenna but I just wanted you to know that at least this guy would not be disappointed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good to know! Thanks.

Yes, the
*Warbreaker*
sequel will happen—but it's near the bottom of my list at the moment. (I'm sorry.) I want to make certain the Stormlight Archive doesn't languish first.
