Now that you're done with the Wheel of Time series, could you update us on your writing plans going forward? I know about the three books coming out this year, but it would be great to see what your thoughts are on the multi-year plan, including the scifi Mistborn trilogy. Are there any plans for sequels to
*Rithmatist*
or
*Steelheart*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Current plans are as follows:

2013:
*Rithmatist*
,
*Steelheart*
,
*Words of Radiance*
  
2014:
*Shadows of Self*
, Steelheart 2
  
2015: Stormlight 3, Rithmatist 2

Usually, in the past, I've done one smaller book and one larger book a year. This is what I'd like to get back to doing. (As opposed to last year and this year—where last year had no novels, and this year has four, including
*A Memory of Light*
.)
