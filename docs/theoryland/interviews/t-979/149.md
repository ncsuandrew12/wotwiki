Hi Brandon, I was wondering, considering that we are supposed to be living now in the First Age, I was wondering what RJ took to be the end of the Fifth Age and the Breaking? Who was the Dragon for that Age? I assume we would remember him in the same way that the people of the Third Age remember Lews Therin.

I'm afraid this is something that must be led to speculation, as if he knew the answer, he did not put it in the notes given to me. I honestly don't know. (Maria might, though. If anyone does, it would be her.)
