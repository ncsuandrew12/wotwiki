Between the banter that happens on Twitter and elsewhere it seems a large crop of the current fantasy writers seem to be quite friendly with each other. Do you feel connected to other fantasy writers in any way? What happens when you meet with other writers—do you gush over each others work, talk shop or just crack on about nothing in particular?

A lot of us went through the same era of reading books, and have many of the same influences. We also went through the publishing experience during a similar time.

So, when we meet at conventions or on signing tours, we tend to have a lot in common. A lot of these folks are a blast to chat with. I wouldn't name them friends, as I only see them once or twice a year. More colleagues whom I admire.

When we hang out, it's a combination of everything you mentioned. I tend to be a little more 'talk shop' focused than others.
