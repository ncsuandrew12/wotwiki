What do you do when you aren't writing, or do to unwind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My favorite way to unwind is to gather together seven friends, and draft some Magic the Gathering. My personal nerd obsession.

Favorite set to draft?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lately, Innistrad. Historically...original Ravnica block, I think. Hard to say.

Also love cubing.

#### Pyroteknik

My friends have built a cube with really high power density. It's just a blast to draft fresh and build a new singleton deck each time your play, isn't it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's awesome. I don't know why it took me so long to come around to trying it.
