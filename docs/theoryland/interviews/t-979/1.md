#### [Brandon SandersonÂ ()](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ced7z/iamstilla_novelist_named_brandon_sanderson_ama/)

Hey, all. Brandon Sanderson here. It's been a while since I did
[my first /r/fantasy AMA](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=622)
, and so I'm back for more punishment...er...questions.

I will answer pretty much anything, though you might want to check out the first AMA to see if your question has already been asked. Feel free to ask spoiler questions, particularly about
*A Memory of Light*
, but do use Spoiler tags (see the bottom right) to keep from ruining the book for others.

That should be everything! I'll be answering questions all day, really, rather than being back at a specific time. Oh, I almost forgot.

There, that should make it very clear this is really me.

Ask away!
