Is there anything in any of your books that, after the fact, you wish you had done differently?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and no. For example, I think that some of the explanations in
*Elantris*
for how the magic works at the end are not terribly clear. However, at the same time, it is the process of making mistakes like this that helps us learn and evolve as writers. Beyond that, going back and changing a piece of art to be something else kind of defeats the point of creating different works of art as one changes as a person. So I don't know if I'd change the mistakes.
