Hi I'm in love with the universe you have created, anyway you can make me a Mistborn in real life, or at least just a pewterarm. I know you are working on it, I'm not fooled. Kidding aside you made me get back into reading again with your awesome stories, thank you.

Enjoy. But please don't eat any metals that will make you sick just because I said it's a good idea...
