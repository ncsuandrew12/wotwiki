Do you have any regrets about the Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do wish I'd managed to either get it all into one book, or managed the split between
*The Gathering Storm*
/
*Towers of Midnight*
better. Also, I might have tried to work Fain in more if I'd had more time. Also, there are some little continuity errors here and there that I wish I would have caught.

It's hard to say. For example, would I have written Mat differently in
*The Gathering Storm*
if I'd had the time? Perhaps. But it was writing Mat the way I did that helped me understand him, so perhaps not. There are mistakes in the books I did, as there are in all the books I've done, but I'm not sure if the right thing to do is change them. Otherwise, we get into a Lucas-style revision-fest.
