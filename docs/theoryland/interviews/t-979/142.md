Are there any plans for more
*Legion*
stories? I really just want a book full of "episodes". Do you think maybe
*Legion*
would work as a comic book?

I plan to do more. The goal was to get a television show going, though I don't know if that will happen. I plan to do a few more episodes to try to motivate the people who bought the TV rights. If that doesn't work, I could see a comic.
