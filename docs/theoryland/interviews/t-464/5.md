# [Interview #464: TGS Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=464#5)

#### Ted Herman

At the signing, I had a recorder going at his table, which I haven't had a chance to listen to yet. I was mostly taking pictures and videos, handing out bookmarks to the crowd of about 250 people, and talking to Maria, who said that she has the best job in the world, and I would certainly not disagree.
