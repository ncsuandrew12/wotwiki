# [Interview #464: TGS Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=464#1)

#### Ted Herman

Abbreviated signing report:

I had a great time, started out meeting my fellow Storm Leaders at Tor. The reception area had shelves full of books and the person who we met there, Paul (who was also at JordanCon) invited us to take (almost) any books we wanted. Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of storage space to carry books, so ended up taking one hardcover,
*Ender's Game*
, but that was very cool.

We then went to a Tor office party and chatted with everyone there, including Tom Doherty, before our private dinner with Brandon, Harriet and Maria. I didn't get to ask a lot of questions, however.
