# [Interview #413: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: JordanCon and Releases, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=413#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This weekend I'll be in Atlanta for
[JordanCon](http://www.ageoflegends.net/?page_id=27)
. I'm expecting to be so busy with the convention that I didn't set up any kind of external signing. I'm still thinking of heading to Atlanta for DragonCon this year, though, and if I do, I'll try to do an off-site signing for those who are interested. However, if you really want something signedâ€”or want to hear about
*A Memory of Light*
(including, I believe, an advance reading from
*The Gathering Storm*
) come by JordanCon. I think it's going to be very fun.

*The Gathering Storm*
goes very well; I'm still working through last-stage revisions from Harriet, Alan, and Maria. I finished Alan's today and sent them off to him for commentary. Harriet's are almost all inputted, and I'm about 3/4 the way through Maria's. I should have this all wrapped up by the time JordanCon rolls around.
