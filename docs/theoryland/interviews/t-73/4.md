# [Interview #73: SFX Magazine Interview, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=73#4)

#### Robert Jordan

#### Footnote

This summary by I. Blandford appears to be of
[this interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=841)
, but this bit about the Creator
*appears*
to be an embellishment on the part of Mr. Blandford. Worth noting, however, is that Blandford said the interview was from "a few months back", but he posted about it in the same month that the documented issue was published, so the documented interview might be an abbreviation of an earlier, longer interview. Any help finding this issue would be appreciated.
