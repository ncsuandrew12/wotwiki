# [Interview #26: Compuserve Chat, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=26#23)

#### Andrew S

Did you think you were going to write only the first book without sequels? If your wife is all the female characters are you all the male ones?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I knew from the start that I was writing something that would be multiple books. I just never knew how many, exactly. The last question: Probably, God help me. Never thought of it that way, though.

#### Footnote

In the
[Starlog interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=9)
, RJ seems to have indicated that it was originally intended to be one book.
