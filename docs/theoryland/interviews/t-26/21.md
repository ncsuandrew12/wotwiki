#### Sharon Perdue

Why weren't Compulsion and Illusion mentioned in the previous books before
*Lord of Chaos*
and is there any specific character in the series that you have taken a liking to?

#### Robert Jordan

Compulsion and Illusion: They weren't mentioned primarily because it wasn't necessary. Actually Compulsion has been mentioned a number of times, and I think Illusion has been mentioned in passing at least once or twice. It just wasn't necessary to deal with them in depth. The answer to the rest of the question: All of them. (Sorry.) I like all of them. Whoever I'm writingâ€”that's the one I like.

#### Footnote

Moiraine actually used Illusion a couple of times in
*The Eye of the World*
; it just wasn't named as such.
