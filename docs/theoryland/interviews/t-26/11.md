available in Canada?

#### Robert Jordan

1. Ray Feist, Janny Wurts, C. S. Friedman, Robert Holdstock, Tad Williams, Barry Hughart. The problem is that there are a lot of people I like, and these are just the first names that come to mind. 2. I'll be in Toronto at the end of October and beginning of November. 3. By the end of the month.
