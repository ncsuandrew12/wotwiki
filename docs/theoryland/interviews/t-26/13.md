#### Sharon Perdue

Did Egwene as Amyrlin happen to be watching people's dreams while Rand was shielded?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Again?

#### Sharon Perdue

Since Rand was shielded and couldn't form any wards on his dreams could Egwene have spied out that he was in trouble while in
*Tel'aran'rhiod?*

#### Robert Jordan

Ah. Yes, she could have. The problem is, when you've learned that something is impossible, you have a tendency to stop trying it. She just didn't try to spy during the period in question.
