#### Kevin

Are Min's visions absolute foretellings or probabilities?

#### Robert Jordan

Her visions are absolute foretellings. The problem is, she doesn't always know what it means. The only changes from that are two visions she's had which indicated the possibility of the future forking, an "either/or." And that's the only time she's ever had anything like that.

#### Footnote

These two visions are: 1) A viewing of Gawyn: [
[TSR 47](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/tsr/ch47.html)
: Gawyn kneeling at Egwene's feet with his head bowed, and Gawyn breaking Egwene's neck, first one then the other, as if either could be the future....The things she saw were very rarely as clear in meaning as those two, and she had never before seen that fluttering back and forth, as though not even the viewing could tell which would be the true future. Worse, she had a feeling near to certainty that it was what she had done this day that had turned Gawyn toward those two possibilities.], and 2) A viewing of Rand, about Perrin: [
[LOC 46](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/loc/ch46.html)
: "Twice he's going to have to be there, or you..." She peered into her goblet so he could not see her face. "If he's not, something bad will happen to you." Her voice sounded small and frightened. "Very bad."]
