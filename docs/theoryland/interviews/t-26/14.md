#### Ben & Chris

This obviously requires huge amounts of plotting and info outlining. Did you have any pertinent WOT info lost during Hurricane Hugo? (And did your house suffer at all?)

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, my house suffered during Hurricane Hugo, and no, I didn't have any significant information loss.
