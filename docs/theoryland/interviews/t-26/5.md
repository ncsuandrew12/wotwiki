# [Interview #26: Compuserve Chat, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=26#5)

#### Degan Outridge

Thanks for many hours of enjoyment. There were so many new stories/threads in
*Lord of Chaos*
did you always intend to go in these directions or did it take on a life of its own?

#### Robert Jordan

For the major threads, I'm going exactly where I intended to goâ€”and for most of the minor threads, I'm going fairly much where I intended to go. With some minor threads, it seemed, as I went along, that there was a better way than I had first thought.
