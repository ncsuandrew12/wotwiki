# [Interview #26: Compuserve Chat, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=26#33)

#### WizOp Wilma Meier

Night Mr. Jordan! And thank you Patrick for your assistance!

#### Patrick Nielsen Hayden

Natalie Farsi, Tor's publicist, says thank you all. I say thank you all. RJ and Harriet are two tired folks. But this was fun. And we're off. Have a good time!

#### Footnote

RJ didn't have internet access at the time, so he most likely joined the chat at the Tor office with Harriet.
