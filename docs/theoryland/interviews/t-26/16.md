#### Joe Rosenman

Greetings! From Rand's Rhuidean vision: If the Sharom is the Dark One's prison, why would it be floating in on place above a city and not in some transcendent plain? Why didn't Rand see it there?

#### Robert Jordan

But it isn't. The Sharom and the Collam Daan are a university/research center. Or were.

#### Joe Rosenman

Also, did Mierin intend to create the Bore?

#### Robert Jordan

In part, yes. Not alone.
