# [Interview #253: Fast Forward Interview, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=253#8)

#### Tom Schaad

And last time we talked, we went into a little bit of a discussion about how you didn't have time to look at the internet, and so going back and forth on the fan sites wasn't something that you did, but...you have a blog!
*You*
have a blog...Robert Jordan has a blog!

#### Robert Jordan

Yes I do, and as a matter of fact, I posted six or seven times in the ten days prior to going on tour.

#### Tom Schaad

How has that experience been?

#### Robert Jordan

It's interesting. A lot of comments from the fans, and it all came about because I had time, having finished this book earlier than I normally do in the cycle, I had time to actually browse some of the sites, and I commented to Jason Denzel who runs Dragonmount about something I had seen, and he said, "Would you like a blog?" And I said, "Well, sure." And people have rushed in to give comments, and I make a post, and go back the next day, and there are already forty, fifty, sixty, seventy comments already up, and I don't know whether that's high for blogs, or low, or what, but it's astounding to me.

#### Tom Schaad

What kind of...is it a dialogue? Are they observations?

#### Robert Jordan

It's a dialogue, really. It was going to be a very infrequent posting when I thought I had something to say to them, and right away I had to quash a rumor that I had cancer.

#### Tom Schaad

What??

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, yes, yes; apparently there was this rumor that I had cancer, and sometimes it was in remission, and sometimes it wasn't, and that's why the books were taking so long.

#### Tom Schaad

[laughs]

#### Robert Jordan

Come on guys, it takes a long time to write a 700-page book!

#### Tom Schaad

There are 761 pages of text in here!

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. So, I had to go back almost immediately and put up another post saying, "No, I do not have cancer, and I never have had cancer," and there were a couple of questions that had been posted at the same time, and so I answered those questions, and it began a sort of dialogue which has ranged from philosophical questions about the things in the books down through "Do you wear boxers or briefs?" I told the lady that asked that that there was only one way for her to find out, and she would not like Harriet's reaction, and neither would I.

#### Tom Schaad

I'm certain that's true.
