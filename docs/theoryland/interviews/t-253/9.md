# [Interview #253: Fast Forward Interview, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=253#9)

#### Tom Schaad

Again, I want to go back to the length of time that this story has taken to tell, and the sheer volume of the narrative. You've always said that you knew, you had that first scene in your head when you started—you had that last scene in your head—and you've always built your books around a series of things that had to happen along the way.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Tom Schaad

But now that we're getting very close to that final book in
*this*
story, I'd like to ask you, are there any surprises that came to you as you were writing about how you got from point Zedd to point 006?

#### Robert Jordan

There were points where I suddenly realized that I did not have to do it the way I had thought I had to do it, I could achieve the same effect more economically, and that might be hard to believe, but I am always looking for economy of words to try to tell this story in as few words as possible.
