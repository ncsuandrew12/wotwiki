#### Tom Schaad

And I have to ask this question too: it won't be for the next few years, but eventually, this series will come to an end, and although you've talked about possibilities, have you looked at doing anything else, or exploring any other types of stories or story lines?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, inside the Wheel of Time, I've always said I would never write in this universe again unless I had a really terrific idea. I
*may*
have an idea that would support two or maybe three of what I've taken to calling 'outrigger' novels—not part of the main arc. I will have to poke at that idea for a year or two to see whether it's really strong enough to stand up to that, really strong enough to support those books. Aside from that, I've signed the contracts for a trilogy, fantasy, to be titled Infinity of Heaven, which will be a different world, different cultures, different customs, different rules.

#### Tom Schaad

Have you had time—because I know how much time it takes for you to create these novels—have you had time to do any preliminary research, or sketching out some basic ideas?

#### Robert Jordan

These books have been kicking around in the back my head for, oh, ten to twelve years, because it was that long ago that I started thinking about, "What am I going to do when I finish the Wheel of Time?" These ideas always kick around in my head for a long time before they come up as a story.

#### Tom Schaad

Well, then we aren't going to have to worry about losing Robert Jordan, author, just because this series is gone.

#### Robert Jordan

No, oh no. I intend to keep writing.

#### Tom Schaad

Good. Good, because we are a selfish people, and we
*like*
our occasional large chunk of fiction delivered to us so that we can devour it hungrily.

#### Robert Jordan

I doubt I will begin writing small, or slim.

#### Tom Schaad

And we wouldn't want you to, because this is the Robert Jordan that we've enjoyed, and this is the Robert Jordan we look forward to.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, thank you.
