What I also found fascinating was...it struck me as I was reading this. The Aes Sedai are undergoing tremendous change for the first time in centuries, and I wondered as I was reading it if one of the problems with their ability to change and to recognize the world changing around them isn't the fact that their longevity allows them to kind of view the world one way, and the older they are, the longer it is that one unchanging way...the harder it is for them to adjust to the change that's occurring in the world.

It's not only that, their own longevity, it is more the longevity of the Tower which has existed as the one stable hall of political power and influence in the world for more than 3000 years. This tends to make people believe that the way they see things is correct, that they must know simply because they've been observing for so long.

#### Tom Schaad

And one of the lovely things about this universe is you very, very carefully explore and explain a number of very different worldviews of different groups that we encounter along this adventure, and it leaves room for people to think about whether or not their worldview is the worldview or just a worldview. Do you ever examine your own, sometimes?

#### Robert Jordan

Sometimes, but I generally figure I'm right, because I have a belly-button.
