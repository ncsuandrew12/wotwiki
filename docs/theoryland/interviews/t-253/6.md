#### Tom Schaad

Now, one of the interesting things that happened along the way to
*Knife of Dreams*
was that you took a small pause and wrote a rather short novel called
*New Spring*
.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Tom Schaad

And out of
*New Spring*
, which is essentially a prequel to story line that we have in the Wheel of Time novels, became a new project: a series of graphic novels of
*New Spring*
. How did that come about?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, the Dabel Brothers approached me, and other people who had written stories in Bob Silverberg's anthology,
*Legends*
, and asked whether we would allow them to do comic books of our novellas, the comic books to be collected into a graphic novel once they were all done, and I had begun the project already—or completed the project—of expanding my novella "New Spring" into the novel
*New Spring*
, and I said, "Well, no I don't want you to do the novella. Do the complete story. You can do
*New Spring*
."

#### Tom Schaad

Now, you're listed of course as the writer because you created the storyline. Did you actually go over and develop the individual scripts for each of novels?

#### Robert Jordan

No, Chuck Dixon does the scripts; the scripts are then sent to me, then I go through them and make corrections and changes, and suggest sometimes a different view, a different scene. I don't mess with it a lot because Chuck Dixon knows what he's doing; on the other hand, I know the book, so sometimes I say, "Look, this is important; you really need to put this in; it's more important than that other thing."

#### Tom Schaad

How have you found the work? Have you been enjoying seeing them coming out in a different form?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh yes, the artwork is fantastic, and I've worked very hard with them to get the characters as close as possible as the way I seem them—I say 'as close as possible'; it couldn't be absolutely the way I see them unless I could draw, which I cannot. And also Trollocs. For the first time, Trollocs are being drawn the way I envision Trollocs.

#### Tom Schaad

Of course, that will be helpful to all the fans of the books, unless of course their own vision is the one they prefer.
