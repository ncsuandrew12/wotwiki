#### Tom Schaad

Well,
*Knife of Dreams*
, number 11 in the series of the Wheel of Time, as we come closer to the end of the Age. And, it's really delightful; I had a marvelous time reading. You keep telling people to Read and Find Out, and if they read this book, boy, are they going to find out a lot! There's a lot of stuff packed into this story line. You've got a lot of pay-off for people who have been waiting for foreshadowings to come to fruition. How did it feel to be able to finally put all of that down after carrying it for so long?

#### Robert Jordan

Good. Very good.

#### Tom Schaad

It's been, well, coming in on twenty years that you've been working on the world...

#### Robert Jordan

Well it
*has*
been twenty years.

#### Tom Schaad

...and it's going to be close to a quarter of a century by the time you finally finish this story. Did you think when you first built this that this much of your life was going to be taken up with this other world that you've created?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh no, no. I signed a contract for six books, and frankly thought it would take me six years to write them, and that that would be that, because I thought I could tell the story in six books.

#### Tom Schaad

Well, it's quite a story, and it's not like there's not enough in there for us to read; it's not like it's been padded by any stretch of the imagination; there's just so much story to tell.

#### Robert Jordan

I've actually dropped out bits, things that I intended to put in, because I realized it was going to push it even further, make it even longer.

#### Tom Schaad

Well you know, there will be mixed feelings from your readers on thatâ€”some that are glad that it just means they'll be getting to the end eventually and to finally find out that last scene that you've talked about for so many years, and others that will be rather sad that they won't have another book in this story line to look forward to another couple of years down the road.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, they will have some books in this world. There are still two short prequel novels to be written at some time in the future, and while I have always said that I would never write in this universe again, unless I came up with a really terrific idea, it's possible that I have come up with an idea for two or maybe three outrigger novels, you might call them. I have to poke at the idea for a year or two and see if it really stands up to that, though, because I don't want to just write something to be writing it. It's gotta be something that's good.

#### Tom Schaad

Well, I understand that; that's perfectly reasonable.
