#### Tom Schaad

And the other thing I wanted to ask is, you have a distinctive narrative style, and you have a very personal style when it comes to exploring the characters. One of the luxuries you have in a story this long, in a story this detailed, is that you can spend some time with the individuals. Have you found economies to describe that, or is that something that you like to spend some time on, so that we get to know the interiors of these people?

#### Robert Jordan

I like spending time in people's heads, yes.

#### Tom Schaad

And of course, as we know, as you're writing a character, that's your favorite character...but it's coming to an end. Are you going to miss this band of adventurers?

#### Robert Jordan

No, because as far as I'm concerned, they'll still be out there kicking around somewhere.

#### Tom Schaad

Good to hear, good to hear.
