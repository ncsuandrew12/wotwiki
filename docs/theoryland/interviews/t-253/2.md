#### Tom Schaad

You know, I have to say first of all, congratulations. I mean, we get many successful authors on this show, many of whom make the best-seller list, but very few of them debut at #1 on
*The New York Times*
' best-seller list when a book comes out. Very well done!

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you, thank you. It's very nice to happen.

#### Tom Schaad

And I'm sure that Mr. Doherty of Tor is extremely happy that it happened, too, I'd say.

#### Robert Jordan
