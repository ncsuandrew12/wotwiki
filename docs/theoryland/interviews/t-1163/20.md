#### Question

(Paraphrased) How did you design a magic system to fit multiple time periods?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mistborn’s a bit of a special case, since I’d planned it all from the beginning. So I was able to plan things and hold them back,knowing that I could use them later. That part of the whole idea behind not having all of the metals get discovered in the first books, and holding back this idea of Twinborn and things like this… though that was a little bit of a happy accident. I was mostly going to focus on Savants.
