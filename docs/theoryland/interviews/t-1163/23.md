#### Question

I began reading your novellas, and I was wondering if you had any plans to follow upâ€¦ [??? Sounds like: Like the Shadows one?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

You may see these worlds again, and you may see these characters again, but there are no planned sequels to these books.

#### Question

So those guys in the ships [in Sixth of the Dusk] were the Mistborn people from the future, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not gonna tell ya.
