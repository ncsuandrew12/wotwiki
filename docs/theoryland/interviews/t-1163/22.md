# [Interview #1163: Shadows of Self - San Francisco, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#22)

#### Question

I was wondering, is Nightblood a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood is an attempt by someone who didn’t know how Shardblades were made to create a Shardblade using a different magic system.

#### Question

If Nightblood feeds on Breath, but Szeth doesn’t have it, will it feed on Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood can feed off Stormlight, but Szeth can't draw in Stormlight right now. So Szeth better not draw that sword, for a while at least.
