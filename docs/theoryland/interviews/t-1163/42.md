# [Interview #1163: Shadows of Self - San Francisco, Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#42)

#### Question

There is quantitative difference in Allomancy (e.g. Elend is stronger than Vin), there is skill difference (e.g. Breeze is better than Vin with zinc), but is there a qualitative difference too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s the scale of what we call savant. Wax can do more with less. It’s not just skill, the burning for long, using for so long, will actually adapt your soul to the power.

#### Question

So can bronze savants pierce Copperclouds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, a bronze savant should be able to pierce copperclouds. It depends on the strengths of the Coppercloud and the strength of the savant, but yes.

#### Question

So Elend could theoretically learn to pierce Copperclouds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Weaker ones, yeah, totally. He can learn how to do it by brute force.
