#### Question

Have we met any of those three yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

For what I was planning there, yes, you have.

#### Question

Does Alloy of Law take place after the whole Stormlight sequence?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not nailed down the exact timing, but it’s at least after book 5 of Stormlight. Because I haven’t nailed down exactly how long

#### Question

Do the glyphs on Roshar have any fundamental connection to [the geography? Some confusion about if they’re connected to Sel.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not going to answer that yet, since I’m going to dig into what’s happening on Sel later.
