# [Interview #1163: Shadows of Self - San Francisco, Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#40)

#### Question

Navani’s emotion fabrial, are those correspondent to the Thaylen Passions in any way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but the Thaylen Passions would’ve come second to some of this.

#### Question

So through a cultural filter--...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. There is no magic to the Thaylen Passions, they are a religion but with no magical component. Sometimes a religion is just a religion.

#### Footnote

Note: What? I feel a little lost in this question, can someone elaborate?
Note Answer: Navani has an emotion fabrial that is laid out like the double-eye. The Thaylen people swear by and maybe worship the Ten Passions. For instance, Rysn exclaims at one point “Oh Craving Passion of Need!”
