# [Interview #1163: Shadows of Self - San Francisco, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#18)

#### Question

Is there a limit to the amount of energy that can be extracted from an end-neutral system (e.g. two Skimmers powering a mechanical device [a Terris-wheel!] by alternately storing their weight and keeping it normal).

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can totally do it. You are drawing Spiritual energy into the Physical realm, so there is actually no loss of energy, it’s just a transfer from one realm to another.

#### Question

Same with Lifeless?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the sustenance for life is coming directly from the Spiritual plane. The whole idea is that energy is getting recycled back into the Spiritual plane (Can’t quite make this out:) by people dying and things like that, so…
