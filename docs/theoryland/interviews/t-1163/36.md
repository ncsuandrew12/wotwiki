# [Interview #1163, Entry #36]: Shadows of Self - San Francisco](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#36)

#### Question

(Heavily paraphrased for clarity) Can you drop a speed bubble whose border goes through a piece of aluminum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think you can’t do that, it would cause the bubble to collapse. Verbatim: It’s probably going to act like you are trying to set up speed bubble on something that’s too small and moving

#### Footnote

Note: Alternatively (obviously I can’t see any gestures going on), this could be interpreted as:
Q\*: If you dropped a speed bubble whose border goes through an aluminum tube, is the inside of the tube affected by the time distortion?
A\*: No, the bubble would go around the tube.
This was a Sharder questions, so a clarification would be very nice.
Note response: This is essentially correct, and Brandon understood what I meant. -- FS
