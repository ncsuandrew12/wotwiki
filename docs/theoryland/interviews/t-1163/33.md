#### Question

When Marasi goes into the carriage with the Soother & Rioter pair - were they really a Soother and a Rioter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why do you ask?

#### Question

I have a feeling that one of them was not an emotional Allomancer.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that they were, yeah. Iâ€™m not gonna string you out on that one.
