#### Question

Are Steelpush and Ironpull strictly momentum conserving?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe they are, Peter has the math, but I believe that they are. You are not losing anything to the cognitive and spiritual realms, if thatâ€™s you are asking. You are pulling energy from those places, but only to cause the push/pull.
