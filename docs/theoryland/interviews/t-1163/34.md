# [Interview #1163: Shadows of Self - San Francisco, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#34)

#### Question

Aradel doesn’t sound like he is from Scadrial, seems out of place with his dark - well, tanned, - skin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aradel is actually based off Goradel, he is a descendant of his. So he is local. The skin, there are streaks of dark skin in Scadrial, they don’t associate them 100% with ethnicities because of the small [gene] pool they were building from, and they are stronger in the Terris bloodlines. So if they see someone with darker skin they will likely think they are from Terris, but there’s so much intermixing so that you can’t really say. Wax would have a darker complexion, maybe like a tanned caucasian.
