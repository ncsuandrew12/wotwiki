# [Interview #1163, Entry #27]: Shadows of Self - San Francisco](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#27)

#### Question

I read some stuff, it’s pretty old, about the sequel to Elantris. Are you still planning on doing it, and is it the same thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s still the same thing, and I’m still planning to do Sarene’s uncle, Kiin, and his family as the main characters.

#### Question

And do we get to learn more about the monks, the Dakhor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Dakhor, yes. You will find more about them, it will take place over in, uh, Fjorden.
