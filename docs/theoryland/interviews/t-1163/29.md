#### Question

If a Mistborn burned both cadmium and bendalloy, would the bubbles be exactly the same size?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is an excellent question that I am not going to answer just yet.

#### Question

If they were the same size, would there still be a barrier between the area of normal time and the area of (maybe) distorted time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. In general, cadmium bubbles are bigger, but you can influence the size.
