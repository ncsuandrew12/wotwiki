# [Interview #1163: Shadows of Self - San Francisco, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1163#8)

#### Question

The whole Cosmere thing, is there an end to it, and do you have a specific year in mind for when that will be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there is an end. Here’s what has to be happen before I finish it. We have to do another two Mistborn trilogies, The Stormlight Archive, at least three Dragonsteel novels. That’s the soonest I can do. I’ll probably have to do a few more Elantris and Warbreaker, but that’s the minimum. Because the third Mistborn trilogy is where we bring things to a head.
