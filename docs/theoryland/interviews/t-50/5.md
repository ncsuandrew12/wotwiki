# [Interview #50: LOC Signing Report - Judy Ghirardelli, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=50#5)

#### Judy Ghirardelli

I think I then asked how long of time elapsed in
*Lord of Chaos*
. Chad—did I ask that? My brain is fried a bit I fear. I
*thought*
I asked it, but I can't recall the answer. Chad? Can you help me out?

Oh, I gave him the list of questions that I had made up—most were Erica's. I figured I did not need them, and he might get a kick out of them. I can post the list here, in case you all want to get a kick out of it. I won't do so now though because the questions came from Erica's personal email to me, and while I don't think she'll give two hoots if I post it, I wanna be sure. We all know how rude it is to post email without permission... but if she gives it, and if anyone wants to see the list (it really is funny) I'll post it. It was fun! Wanna add anything Chad? Or Jim or Russ?

Oh, I got him to sign the books to Judy, except for
*Lord of Chaos*
which he signed to "Judy Sedai, the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills—Robert Jordan". Cool, huh?
