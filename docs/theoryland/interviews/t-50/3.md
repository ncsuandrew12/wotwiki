# [Interview #50: LOC Signing Report - Judy Ghirardelli, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=50#3)

#### Judy Ghirardelli

Theoretically, if you, well not
*you*
, if someone, well, err, ummm, ... \*blushing furiously\*... had sex in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, could they be pregnant in the real world?

#### Robert Jordan

He just stared at me for what seemed an eternity. Eventually, and it must have been
*days*
later, I was
*so*
embarrassed, he smiled and said, "Read and find out. I
*like*
the dirty questions! You notice it's always the women who ask the dirty questions, never the men."

#### Judy Ghirardelli

I sputtered and babbled a bit, saying, "It was not really dirty, and it was my husband's question, not mine at all, not dirty, no..", after which I was reduced to a blathering idiot. How embarrassing! On the way out of line, Chad teased me about asking dirty questions... After this, I was just like a deer frozen in the headlights. I could not think of any other thing to say (even though I had the list in front of me).
