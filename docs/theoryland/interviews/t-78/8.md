# [Interview #78: Letter to Thomas Howard, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=78#8)

#### Thomas Howard

Why was Cadsuane dropped in out of the blue? (Basically, the problem people were having was that she was supposedly a legend among her sisters, so we should have heard of her before
*A Crown of Swords*
.)

#### Robert Jordan

Mr. Jordan's response was that most Aes Sedai hadn't seen hide nor hair of her in twenty years. To quote: "The assumption on the part of nearly everyone was that she
*had*
[emphasis his] to be dead by this time."

#### THOMAS HOWARD

Essentially, I take this to mean they didn't bother talking or thinking about her because of this assumption. He also stated that "only a few sisters had seen her" during the capturing of Logain and that her involvement with the incident was minimal.
