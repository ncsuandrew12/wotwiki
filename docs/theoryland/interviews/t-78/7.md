# [Interview #78: Letter to Thomas Howard, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=78#7)

#### Thomas Howard

Why did Mat think that someone was "holding" the True Source when his medallion grew cold? (That is I thought it only did this when he came in contact with an actual flow. This occurred on page 595 of
*A Crown of Swords*
, for reference.)

I'm going to quote the whole response again.

#### Robert Jordan

"Mat's medallion gets icy cold if someone directs the One Power at him, but it would be cool if the Power was being used near him, and almost cold if it were being used very near him."
