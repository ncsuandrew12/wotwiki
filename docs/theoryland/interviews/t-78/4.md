# [Interview #78: Letter to Thomas Howard, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=78#4)

#### Thomas Howard

Why couldn't Moghedien escape the leash with the True Power?

I'm just going to quote the whole response to this:

#### Robert Jordan

"The
*a'dam*
would perceive
*any*
[emphasis mine] power use and treat it accordingly."

#### THOMAS HOWARD

I don't know about you, but this seems to support the idea that one must be able to channel the One Power in order to use the True Power.

#### Footnote

In case it isn't obvious, the Domination Band is not just a 'male
*a'dam*
'â€”there are several fundamental differences that we already knew about before
*The Gathering Storm*
.
