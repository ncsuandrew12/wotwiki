# [Interview #78: Letter to Thomas Howard, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=78#10)

#### Thomas Howard

Would you please state for the record that Rand's helper at the end (of
*A Crown of Swords*
) was
*not*
Lews Therin?

#### Robert Jordan

To quote (and God do I like to hear this): "Lews Therin Telamon is dead, not walking around Shadar Logoth."

#### THOMAS HOWARD

I'm quite sure it's a safe assumption that he isn't walking around anywhere else either.

#### Footnote

Rand's 'helper' in Shadar Logoth in
*A Crown of Swords*
Chapter 41 was Moridin.
