# [Interview #78, Entry #5]: Letter to Thomas Howard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=78#5)

#### Thomas Howard

1. What do Rand's wards on
*Callandor*
ward against exactly?

2. Are the black cords on male Forsaken the means to access to the True Power?

3. If so, why don't the female Forsaken have them?

#### Robert Jordan

"Read and find out" on all three counts.

#### THOMAS HOWARD

Damn. I still don't think the cords have anything to do with True Power usage though.
