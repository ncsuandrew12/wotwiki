Do you tend to edit your writing often or is your preference to not even look at it again once it is written?

#### Robert Jordan

I rewrite constantly while I am writing the book. For example, the prologue of
*The Path of Daggers*
had fifteen to eighteen rewrites...I don't remember, because I constantly change things as I go along. But towards the end there are fewer rewrites, so the last chapters may have only three or four or five each. When I have finished the book, I go through it one last time and then I cut off, because I realize that I could constantly improve each book.
