#### Joni

Mr. Jordan, what advice would you give to a young and aspiring writer? And are these just rumors I hear that you might come to Portland, Oregon soon for a signing?

#### Robert Jordan

I was in Portland Oregon several days ago for a signing. My advice to a writer is to write; write and send it to paying markets.
