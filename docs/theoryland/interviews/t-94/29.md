Is there anyway we can contact you Mr. Jordan? Do you have an email address or website we can go to? Can we contact you through your publishing house?

#### Robert Jordan

Write to me or email me at my publishing house. I don't reply by email though, so you'll have to give me a snail mail address and wait.

That's TOR Books 175 Fifth Ave NYC 10010.
