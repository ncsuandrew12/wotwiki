For late comers, our guest is ROBERT JORDAN and you can ask him a question if you like! Just send it to me, Moderator, as a private message! I'm curious, Robert... I know you're on tour and deluged with fans asking LOTS of questions. What's a question you'd really like to answer that no one's asked? (Moderator smiles)

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think there is a question that no one's asked. Including the most personal and intimate that you can imagine. Somebody will always ask anything.

That's a CHALLENGE to us at SCIFI.CON! As k Robert something utterly challenging and unique, 'kay?
