#### TMFG

You once said that all the info needed for solving Asmodean was there by the end of
*The Fires of Heaven*
. Does this eliminate a
*gholam*
from being a suspect? It's generally believed that a
*gholam*
was responsible for the murder of Lord Barthanes in
*The Great Hunt*
and the two Black sisters in
*The Shadow Rising*
, but I don't think it mentions a name.

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. Read And Find Out.

#### Footnote

Joiya and Amico were killed by Slayerâ€”he thinks of it in his POV in
*Winter's Heart*
Chapter 22, 'Out of Thin Air'. (This is
[one of those instances](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=52#8)
where RJ slipped in some info because people had come to an entirely incorrect conclusion.)
