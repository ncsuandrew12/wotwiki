Here's a longish question from Linda that somehow fell in between the cracks... Part One from Linda: Since the ability to channel seems to be primarily linked to the soul, if a channeler is gentled/stilled, will this affect his/hers soul in a follow life as well, as in, will the ability to channel still be lost? Did THAT come through??

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Moderator

Hmmmmm.. Linda, I TRIED.

#### Robert Jordan

(that was the answer...the answer is no)

#### Moderator

Oh!! Duh!

#### Neptune

I think Linda is asking if the soul is immortal in Jordan's world.

#### Moderator

So...is it??

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, the soul is immortal.
