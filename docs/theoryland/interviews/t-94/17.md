Do you see a movie coming in the future? [Moderator: From your books, I bet ilrudy means.]

#### Robert Jordan

Not unless someone wants to make an 18 hour film. That's how long any one of these books would take, I believe.

#### Moderator

A miniseries? (Moderator smiles)

#### Robert Jordan

And no one is doing miniseries any more. Of course, "New Spring" has just been released but no one has come sniffing around yet. Boorman would be the guy...
