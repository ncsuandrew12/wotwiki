What's his favorite sci-fi movie?

#### Robert Jordan

Actually...I think I have to go all the way back to
*Forbidden Planet*
. My favorite fantasy movie would have to be
*Excalibur*
. There are a lot of good science fiction movies out there, from
*Bladerunner*
to
*The Day The Earth Stood Still*
to
*The Terminator*
, but nothing can touch
*Excalibur*
.

#### Footnote

RJ referenced
[*Terminator 2: Judgment Day*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/)
rather blatantly with the 'new breed' of Darkhounds first encountered by Rand in Rhuidean, to the point that the fans often refer to them as T2 Darkhounds. There are two Excalibur parallels in WoT:
*Callandor*
and Justice.
