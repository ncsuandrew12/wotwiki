#### Neptune

Has anyone asked how many books he expects the series to go to? If not, how many?

#### Robert Jordan

I am only asked that question by about 300 people a day. The answer is that there will be at least three more books. At least. As I said earlier, I know everything that I want to happen and I have known the last scene of the last book for fifteen years. I also know that I cannot get everything that I want to happen into less than three more books. So that's where we stand at the moment.
