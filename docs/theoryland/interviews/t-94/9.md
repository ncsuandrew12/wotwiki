#### Nick

How long does it take you to write a full-length novel?

#### Robert Jordan

*The Eye of The World*
took four years. The next five took fourteen or fifteen months each.
*A Crown of Swords*
took 22 months.
*The Path of Daggers*
took a little less than that, but during that book I wrote "New Spring" for the
*Legends*
anthology. And I also did a lot of work on a title coming up: The Illustrated Guide.
