# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#21)

#### Matt Hatch

You had a quote that we all talked about just recently, that there is a small detail with this secret thing. There were two quotes we put together where you told somebody from Chicago where you say this detail first comes out between books 4-6. Is that verified?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s been going for a long time. Somewhere in four and six the first hints of it are mentioned.

#### MATT HATCH

But that’s not the only time it’s ever mentioned?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It’s not the only time it’s ever mentioned. It is…hints about this hidden thing appear in pretty much...in several of the books. It first, somewhere in one of those three is the beginning of where it shows up. The first hint that you get. [...] I mean, it’s a small thing that means something large, that sort of thing...and you guys are very good at finding things and I’m not going to say whether you hit it or not.
