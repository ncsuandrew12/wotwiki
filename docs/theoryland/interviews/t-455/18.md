# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#18)

#### Question

Is the Court of Nine Moons something that moves with the Empress? In other words, wherever the Empress is holding court is that the Court of Nine Moons?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think that would be subject of debate, depending on what...I think that if the Empress were to declare herself on a different continent she would expect that it would and I think there would be those that would argue with her and wouldnâ€™t expect that it would. Does that make sense? So, my answer would be that it would move with the Empress, but there are those that would disagree with me and with the Empress, may she live forever.

#### Footnote

This was asked in reference to the
*Karaethon*
prophecy stating that Rand will 'bind the nine moons to serve him'. A similar question might have been asked about the Crystal Throne.
