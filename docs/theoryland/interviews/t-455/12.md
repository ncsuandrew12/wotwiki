# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#12)

#### Question

Are you going to discuss Moiraine in the future?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Way to give me a great out. Moiraine will be mentioned in future books. [...] In future books there will certainly be references. Her name will at least be mentioned, at the very least in the Appendix. In fact, I think in
*The Gathering Storm*
the entire letter to Thom is in the Appendix.
