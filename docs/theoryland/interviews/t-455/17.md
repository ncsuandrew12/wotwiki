# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#17)

#### Question

We know that
*The Karaethon Cycle*
and
*The Essanik Cycle*
are different. Is that because there were different contributors to each, or some other reason (like tampering by Ishamael)? Which is more correct?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Essanik Cycle*
is had only in Seanchan and there were different contributors. Which is more correct? I’m not going to say which is more correct. There has been tampering...

#### QUESTION

In both?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

People are not perfect, alright? Let’s just say that and there are lots of forces at work.
*The Essanik Cycle*
, they have tried to preserve it as perfectly as they can. If the Outriggers ever get written there will be more information about what
*The Essanik Cycle*
is. It is had only in Seanchan. It was given by
*damane*
in Seanchan, so nobody knows about it on the main continent.
