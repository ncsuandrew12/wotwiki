# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#14)

#### Question

When Perrin is chasing Slayer in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, does Slayer actually disappear into the Tower of Ghenjei or does he disappear from the Dream?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s actually something I wondered and I asked and that’s a RAFO. Both Slayer and the Tower of Ghenjei are things that are reserved for
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### Footnote

RJ
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#24)
that you cannot enter the Tower of Ghenjei in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
at all. Most fans conclude that Slayer must have stepped out.
