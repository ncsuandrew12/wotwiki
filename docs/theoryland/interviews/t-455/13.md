# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#13)

#### Question

Was Ishamael partially, or was he responsible for the initiation of the Three Oaths? Was he a part of what brought them about?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a MAFO. Type that one out. That’s a MAFO.

No. What is now the second oath (To make no weapon with which one man may kill another) was the first one that the Aes Sedai adopted. “It grew from an impulse within the Aes Sedai themselves coming from tales passed down regarding the War of the Shadow. The other two oaths certainly grew out of the suspicion of ordinary people towards these Aes Sedai.” (That’s a quote from the notes, btw). Sometimes things happen without an agent of the Dark One’s involvement, and sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
