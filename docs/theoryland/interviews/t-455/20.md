# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#20)

#### Matt Hatch

Is it an assumption that we haven’t seen the last of these individuals right here (I was pointing at the Seanchan assassins)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There were five sent. We know one is dead. The other four, they may have lived or died through the assault, it was pretty chaotic, but they are expert warriors with
*ter’angreal*
focused on letting them hide.

#### QUESTION

How long does that affect last? Days?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That effect can be stretched if they take it off, for several weeks. It is going to kill them eventually. If they are wearing it straight, it’s not going to last long, a matter of days, but if they take it off they can hide for a matter of weeks. So, there are four unaccounted for, who have orders to kill as many Aes Sedai as they can.
