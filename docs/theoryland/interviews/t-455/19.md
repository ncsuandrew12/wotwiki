# [Interview #455: TGS Midnight Release - Matt Hatch, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=455#19)

#### Matt Hatch

There is a character in the book that appears to die on page 574...

[reads page]..there is a woman that actually dies here...[couldn't decipher for certain if this was a statement or a moving question/comment.]

#### MATT HATCH

Did this character actually die?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Let’s go on record with this, I am not going to say until after
*Towers of Midnight*
, but I will...they are looking for a “toast” comment, and I am not going to give the “toast” comment yet. The scene that I’m talking about, there will be things related to it in the next book, so I don’t want to say yet. Corner me after
*Towers of Midnight*
and I will give you a definitive answer, but
*Towers of Midnight*
may in itself give a definitive answer.
