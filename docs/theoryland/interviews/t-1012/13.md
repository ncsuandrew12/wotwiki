# [Interview #1012, Entry #13]: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Andrew the Great](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1012#13)

Warbreaker Questions:

#### ANDREW THE GREAT

If Denth had let Vasher erase part of his memories, would he still retain the skills he had learned during that time?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

To an extent. He would still have the reflexes and such, but skill isn't entirely reflexes, so he would lose the parts actually associated with memory. It would be easier for him to re-learn, due to his already having the reflexes, but he wouldn't be nearly as good at these skills without the memories or re-learning them. As a side note, Denth almost did it. Like really really close. He decided not to because he felt that he would be losing part of himself. And he would be right.
