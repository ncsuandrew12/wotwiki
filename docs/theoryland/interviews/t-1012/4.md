# [Interview #1012: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Andrew the Great, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1012#4)

#### Andrew the Great

Will you write any other WoT Books after the series is finished?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

That depends on a lot of things. First of all, if Harriet wants them written. Second, if Brandon feels that they are being written for the right reasons. He would consider writing the Prequels and outriggers if and only if he felt they were being written to complete and enhance the story. If on the other hand he feels like they are just continuing the WoT Franchise, then no. He also said he wouldn't write anything other than the prequels and outriggers no matter what.

#### Footnote

Brandon and Harriet have since decided that the prequels and outriggers will not be written.
