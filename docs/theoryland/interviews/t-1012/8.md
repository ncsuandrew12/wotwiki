#### Andrew the Great

What benefit does an aluminum savant get?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

(After a short period of laughing)

Is it even possible to become an aluminum savant? You'd have to be burning aluminum consistently, and aluminum just kind of goes away in a burst.... After that, he discussed how being an aluminum Misting will likely be considered a handicap in the Mistborn RPG because you can't pick up other Allomantic abilities.
