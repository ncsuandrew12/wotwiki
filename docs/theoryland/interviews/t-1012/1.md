# [Interview #1012, Entry #1]: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Andrew the Great](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1012#1)

#### Andrew the Great

Ok, I decided to do a new topic instead of just replying in my questions thread because I heard several things from Brandon that I thought everyone would want to know, and not just the people who posted in that thread. I had an extensive conversation with Brandon, like 45 minutes of just me asking questions and him answering, and then there was an hour before that of other people asking questions and him answering. So, if you asked a question that I didn't answer, I'm terribly sorry. I hope you'll just be satisfied with these answers, plus some fun new (to me at least) information. Plus some that I know is new because he told me so.

MAJOR SPOILERS ARE POSTED BELOW FOR ALL OF BRANDON'S PUBLISHED WORKS AND SEVERAL OF HIS UNPUBLISHED
