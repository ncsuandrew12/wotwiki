# [Interview #1012: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Andrew the Great, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1012#10)

#### Andrew the Great

Where do the mists go in the day, why do they just disappear?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

The mists are kind of like the physical manifestation of Preservation's power. During the day, the power is still there, but the mists that accompany them during the night are burned away by the sun. So really, it's more that they are somehow linked to Preservations power, and come out at night with the power, but they can't stay with the power during the day because of the sun.
