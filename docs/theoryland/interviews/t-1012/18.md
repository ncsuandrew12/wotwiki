# [Interview #1012: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Andrew the Great, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1012#18)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Some as of yet unwritten book that I can't remember the title of, but know that it included the word Divine. Maybe Ook can help me out here. Anyway, it has a magic system in which the magic is caused by bacteria. Basically, the bacteria and parasites want their hosts to survive as long as possible, so they give them magic. The example Brandon used was that if someone caught the common cold, they could fly until they got over that cold.
