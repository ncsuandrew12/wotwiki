# [Interview #1012: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Andrew the Great, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1012#22)

#### Andrew the Great

So that's what I remember for now. If I remember anything else, I'll let you know. If you have questions, feel free to ask them, they may make me remember something more.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I forgot Elantris sequel, if it happens. If Brandon makes one, it will be from the viewpoint of Sarene's uncle's children. Or I guess that makes them her cousins. The one who was like autistic and the other little girl. I don't remember their names.

#### Footnote

The Elantris sequel will follow Adien, Kaise, and Daorn.
