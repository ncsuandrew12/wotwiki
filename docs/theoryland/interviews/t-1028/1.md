Just a reminder, all.
*Steelheart*
—my new novel—is out right now! It hit #1 on the
*New York Times*
bestseller list in the Young Adult category. If you're curious, you can read about the book

. And as a side note, Amazon's US Kindle store today has
[*The Way of Kings*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P2WO5E?tag=brandsande-20)
at $1.26 for some reason.
