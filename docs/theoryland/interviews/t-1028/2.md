# [Interview #1028: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: The Wheel of Time Retrospective: A Memory of Light: The Black Tower, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1028#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan didn't leave me a ton of direction regarding the Black Tower. There were a few gems that we knew, but in a lot of places I was left to follow my instincts regarding the plotting points he had built across the last few books. He
*did*
leave a lot of clear instructions regarding Taim, fortunately, including his backstory and instructions for a scene where Taim was named as one of the Forsaken.
