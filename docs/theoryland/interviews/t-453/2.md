# [Interview #453, Entry #2]: TGS Midnight Release Preliminary Report - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=453#2)

#### Matt Hatch

I asked, in essence, are One Power and True Power balefire the same?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He answered that the True Power is another source of power, that Aes Sedai were researching another source, like a different form of battery, to power their weaves and that for balefire, what it does is essentially the same between both power sources, but that it has different affects on the individual using the power source (this appeared to be a reference to what True Power does to its user).
