# [Interview #453: TGS Midnight Release Preliminary Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=453#1)

#### Matt Hatch

Was the taint influential in the creation/development/existence of the voice of Lews Therin in Rand's head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon answered that the taint was influential, but not the only factor. He referenced Semirhage, that of course we can't believe the Forsaken always, but yes, that the taint was an influence in the the voice. That we have to accept that in fact, in a way, Rand is going insane (as in as the books progress).
