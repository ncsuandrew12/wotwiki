## [Entry #1](./t-1163/1)

#### Question

Have we seen Odium’s champion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. (He did mention that this was only the second time someone had thought to ask this particular question.)

## [Entry #2](./t-1163/2)

#### Question

What are the odds of making a Stormlight RPG?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If the Mistborn RPG goes well, maybe in the future.

## [Entry #3](./t-1163/3)

#### Question

In Hero of Ages, I don’t quite understand why… the point of Hoid is in Fadrex, going around the city, gathering information…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not many people do! It’s an intentional secret, I have to wait a little while longer to explain it.

## [Entry #4](./t-1163/4)

#### Question

Does Hoid go to the same place the Elantrian’s (Elantrians are? ) going?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #5](./t-1163/5)

#### Question

Is Stormlight an infinite resource or a finite one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Stormlight is a renewing resource.

## [Entry #6](./t-1163/6)

#### Question

How far away from the original Mistborn trilogy is The Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

From the original Mistborn trilogy? 300 years-ish. It’s happening kind of… Just before The Alloy of Law era.

## [Entry #7](./t-1163/7)

#### Question

Does the spren have to be present for a Surgebinder to have their abilities? Because with Dalinar, the Stormfather won’t be around all the time...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good Question! Fortunately, the Stormfather is a little more omnipresent. Normally you’re gonna have to have your spren close, but the Stormfather absorbed... is basically Honor’s cognitive shadow, which means he’s got a connection to a lot of different things, so he’s not bound by a lot of the rules that others are.

## [Entry #8](./t-1163/8)

#### Question

The whole Cosmere thing, is there an end to it, and do you have a specific year in mind for when that will be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there is an end. Here’s what has to be happen before I finish it. We have to do another two Mistborn trilogies, The Stormlight Archive, at least three Dragonsteel novels. That’s the soonest I can do. I’ll probably have to do a few more Elantris and Warbreaker, but that’s the minimum. Because the third Mistborn trilogy is where we bring things to a head.

## [Entry #9](./t-1163/9)

#### Question

So alternate ending of Well of Ascension … [???] three more spirits… [???] if another Shard would show up [with the?] mist spirit, is that in [???] (Note: Referring to the middle of this page: http://brandonsanderson.com/mistborn-2-alternate-ending-part-two/)

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s in.[???] There are things you don’t know about the mist spirit yet I am planning to reveal soon.

## [Entry #10](./t-1163/10)

#### Question

Have we met any of those three yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

For what I was planning there, yes, you have.

#### Question

Does Alloy of Law take place after the whole Stormlight sequence?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not nailed down the exact timing, but it’s at least after book 5 of Stormlight. Because I haven’t nailed down exactly how long

#### Question

Do the glyphs on Roshar have any fundamental connection to [the geography? Some confusion about if they’re connected to Sel.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not going to answer that yet, since I’m going to dig into what’s happening on Sel later.

## [Entry #11](./t-1163/11)

#### Question

I was wondering how you pronounce Szeth.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I say “Zeth.”

## [Entry #12](./t-1163/12)

#### FirstSelector

I asked Brandon to sign my two books with "tell me something about the Order of Elsecallers" and "tell me something about the Order of Willshapers."

#### Brandon Sanderson

He responded "Turning stone into putty is fun!" and "Popping in and out of Shadesmar is fun too!"

## [Entry #13](./t-1163/13)

#### Question

(Abbreviated for clarity). So I’ve noticed a certain syllable, “Vo,” that turns up in this book [Warbreaker] and also in Vorinism. Is there supposed to be a link between Vo, the First Returned, because there seem to be a great deal of similarities between the monks of Austre and the Ardents.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So there are, um, more links between the planets than people know about, and I’m not going to confirm or deny anything. But the fact that you’re finding words that are connecting, like Worldsingers and Worldbringers, says that there’s… intentional connections. I’m not [confirming a connection], I’m saying that these theories should not be dismissed out of hand.

## [Entry #14](./t-1163/14)

#### Question

In Shadows for Silence one of the characters refers to “Justice has died here.” Is that the actual Shard of Justice?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a great theory! (Big grin, raised eyebrows.)

## [Entry #15](./t-1163/15)

#### Question

If you could be a Misting, what would you be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’d choose steel because I would like to fly around.

## [Entry #16](./t-1163/16)

#### Question

If an Allomancer found themselves on Nalthis or Roshar, would they be able to use chromium on someone using Stormlight or Breath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am staying away from answering too many questions like that until I start having it happen. But do know that the magics interact... some ways they interact very naturally, some ways, they don’t. One way I’ve released is, you could use bronze on most forms of Investiture to find it. So you can extrapolate that some of these things would work. But not necessarily all. All of them could be made to work.

## [Entry #17](./t-1163/17)

#### Question

Shardblade vs. lightsaber, which one would win in a clash?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on who’s writing it, I or Lucas. If I were writing it, I’d say they bounce off each other.

## [Entry #18](./t-1163/18)

#### Question

Is there a limit to the amount of energy that can be extracted from an end-neutral system (e.g. two Skimmers powering a mechanical device [a Terris-wheel!] by alternately storing their weight and keeping it normal).

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can totally do it. You are drawing Spiritual energy into the Physical realm, so there is actually no loss of energy, it’s just a transfer from one realm to another.

#### Question

Same with Lifeless?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the sustenance for life is coming directly from the Spiritual plane. The whole idea is that energy is getting recycled back into the Spiritual plane (Can’t quite make this out:) by people dying and things like that, so…

## [Entry #19](./t-1163/19)

#### Question

Could an old [Feruchemist] go and transfer his Coppermind to his star pupil using Hemalurgy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Like Deliberate…? Right. Ask me that question after you’ve read a few more Mistborn books.

## [Entry #20](./t-1163/20)

#### Question

(Paraphrased) How did you design a magic system to fit multiple time periods?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mistborn’s a bit of a special case, since I’d planned it all from the beginning. So I was able to plan things and hold them back,knowing that I could use them later. That part of the whole idea behind not having all of the metals get discovered in the first books, and holding back this idea of Twinborn and things like this… though that was a little bit of a happy accident. I was mostly going to focus on Savants.

## [Entry #21](./t-1163/21)

#### Question

How does Harmony know about radio?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are actually two answers to this. First, Harmony was given a grand understanding of the laws of the universe during his Ascension. Second, Preservation had some limited precognitive abilities. Either one of those can lead you to the answer.

## [Entry #22](./t-1163/22)

#### Question

I was wondering, is Nightblood a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood is an attempt by someone who didn’t know how Shardblades were made to create a Shardblade using a different magic system.

#### Question

If Nightblood feeds on Breath, but Szeth doesn’t have it, will it feed on Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood can feed off Stormlight, but Szeth can't draw in Stormlight right now. So Szeth better not draw that sword, for a while at least.

## [Entry #23](./t-1163/23)

#### Question

I began reading your novellas, and I was wondering if you had any plans to follow up… [??? Sounds like: Like the Shadows one?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

You may see these worlds again, and you may see these characters again, but there are no planned sequels to these books.

#### Question

So those guys in the ships [in Sixth of the Dusk] were the Mistborn people from the future, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not gonna tell ya.

## [Entry #24](./t-1163/24)

#### Question

Book recommendations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon recommended the writings of Brent Weeks and Brian McClellan multiple times to various questioners asking for authors with a similar writing style to Brandon. Especially the book The Black Prism.

## [Entry #25](./t-1163/25)

#### Question

Do you think we are likely to get another story in the Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, you’ll probably get another story in the same world, just different characters.

## [Entry #26](./t-1163/26)

#### Question

I was wondering about the Ryshadium. So, they can’t be tamed, so where do you go to [get them from]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will find out some of this in Book 3.

## [Entry #27](./t-1163/27)

#### Question

I read some stuff, it’s pretty old, about the sequel to Elantris. Are you still planning on doing it, and is it the same thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s still the same thing, and I’m still planning to do Sarene’s uncle, Kiin, and his family as the main characters.

#### Question

And do we get to learn more about the monks, the Dakhor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Dakhor, yes. You will find more about them, it will take place over in, uh, Fjorden.

## [Entry #28](./t-1163/28)

#### Question

Somebody said that you were writing “hands all red” in all the books, can you tell me what that means?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s just a line from the book I feel captures the tone of the book well.

## [Entry #29](./t-1163/29)

#### Question

If a Mistborn burned both cadmium and bendalloy, would the bubbles be exactly the same size?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is an excellent question that I am not going to answer just yet.

#### Question

If they were the same size, would there still be a barrier between the area of normal time and the area of (maybe) distorted time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. In general, cadmium bubbles are bigger, but you can influence the size.

## [Entry #30](./t-1163/30)

#### Question

More of Sixth of the Dusk world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will see more of the world or the characters, but I have no immediate plans for a sequel.

## [Entry #31](./t-1163/31)

#### Question

Is it possible for spren to move from one planet to another?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is possible for them to get to other planets. They are tied to certain realms… A lot of them reside in the cognitive realm and are pulled into the physical by their bonds--

#### Question

Would they bring the same magics?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That you will have to wait and see.

## [Entry #32](./t-1163/32)

#### Question

What were Wayne and Hoid talking about outside the carriage?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #33](./t-1163/33)

#### Question

When Marasi goes into the carriage with the Soother & Rioter pair - were they really a Soother and a Rioter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why do you ask?

#### Question

I have a feeling that one of them was not an emotional Allomancer.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that they were, yeah. I’m not gonna string you out on that one.

## [Entry #34](./t-1163/34)

#### Question

Aradel doesn’t sound like he is from Scadrial, seems out of place with his dark - well, tanned, - skin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aradel is actually based off Goradel, he is a descendant of his. So he is local. The skin, there are streaks of dark skin in Scadrial, they don’t associate them 100% with ethnicities because of the small [gene] pool they were building from, and they are stronger in the Terris bloodlines. So if they see someone with darker skin they will likely think they are from Terris, but there’s so much intermixing so that you can’t really say. Wax would have a darker complexion, maybe like a tanned caucasian.

## [Entry #35](./t-1163/35)

#### Question

Can all Shards have champions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is a, um, Theoretically possible, but you’ll find more about the backstory of why this works here (presumably he is referring to Stormlight).

## [Entry #36](./t-1163/36)

#### Question

(Heavily paraphrased for clarity) Can you drop a speed bubble whose border goes through a piece of aluminum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think you can’t do that, it would cause the bubble to collapse. Verbatim: It’s probably going to act like you are trying to set up speed bubble on something that’s too small and moving

#### Footnote

Note: Alternatively (obviously I can’t see any gestures going on), this could be interpreted as:
Q\*: If you dropped a speed bubble whose border goes through an aluminum tube, is the inside of the tube affected by the time distortion?
A\*: No, the bubble would go around the tube.
This was a Sharder questions, so a clarification would be very nice.
Note response: This is essentially correct, and Brandon understood what I meant. -- FS

## [Entry #37](./t-1163/37)

#### Question

Could - would - Odium ever work with another Shard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If he were in charge. This is within the realm of possibility. In fact, that may have happened at various points. (I swear I can hear his sly smile…)

## [Entry #38](./t-1163/38)

#### Question

Do you have a name for the veil, or the division, between realms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’ve had like three of four different names, but I haven’t settled on one yet.

## [Entry #39](./t-1163/39)

#### Question

Is crem spren poop? Or at least… not literally, but something like it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it’s more like Shard poop. (Somewhat unsure sounding?

## [Entry #40](./t-1163/40)

#### Question

Navani’s emotion fabrial, are those correspondent to the Thaylen Passions in any way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but the Thaylen Passions would’ve come second to some of this.

#### Question

So through a cultural filter--...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. There is no magic to the Thaylen Passions, they are a religion but with no magical component. Sometimes a religion is just a religion.

#### Footnote

Note: What? I feel a little lost in this question, can someone elaborate?
Note Answer: Navani has an emotion fabrial that is laid out like the double-eye. The Thaylen people swear by and maybe worship the Ten Passions. For instance, Rysn exclaims at one point “Oh Craving Passion of Need!”

## [Entry #41](./t-1163/41)

#### Question

Is aluminum shielding from emotional Allomancy strictly line of sight? So, can someone in the basement bypass somebody’s aluminum hat on the first floor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, they could not. You just put enough aluminum there and it disrupts.

#### Question

So it disrupts like a field.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep.

## [Entry #42](./t-1163/42)

#### Question

There is quantitative difference in Allomancy (e.g. Elend is stronger than Vin), there is skill difference (e.g. Breeze is better than Vin with zinc), but is there a qualitative difference too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s the scale of what we call savant. Wax can do more with less. It’s not just skill, the burning for long, using for so long, will actually adapt your soul to the power.

#### Question

So can bronze savants pierce Copperclouds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, a bronze savant should be able to pierce copperclouds. It depends on the strengths of the Coppercloud and the strength of the savant, but yes.

#### Question

So Elend could theoretically learn to pierce Copperclouds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Weaker ones, yeah, totally. He can learn how to do it by brute force.

## [Entry #43](./t-1163/43)

#### Question

Are Steelpush and Ironpull strictly momentum conserving?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe they are, Peter has the math, but I believe that they are. You are not losing anything to the cognitive and spiritual realms, if that’s you are asking. You are pulling energy from those places, but only to cause the push/pull.
