# [Interview #575, Entry #9]: TOM Signing Report - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=575#9)

#### Ted Herman

Since the room was so small as to be overflowing, the B&N people shooed everyone out after they got their books signed, so I had no chance to eavesdrop on other people's questions for Brandon and Team Jordan, though I did stick around for the raffle and some trivia questions (got a few right but somehow forgot how many sisters Mat has though I did remember their names). However, Tower Guardsman Tom said his fiance Erin is taking down the questions and answers and will post a report in the next day or so. Woot! (He was also curious about Matt's reaction to the killer of Asmodean :P)

I was able to ask 2 questions as my books were signed.
