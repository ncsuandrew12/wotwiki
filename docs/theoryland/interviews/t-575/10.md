# [Interview #575, Entry #10]: TOM Signing Report - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=575#10)

#### Ted Herman

Paraphrased since it is a long question (though I did read it right from my iPhone as it was worded): Are the ghost sightings and strange window seen in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
(flame and fang) due to the Mirror Worlds merging?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are both due to the Pattern unraveling.
