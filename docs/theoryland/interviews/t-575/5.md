# [Interview #575: TOM Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=575#5)

#### Question

(a takeoff on Leigh's review) I've seen this somewhere before:
*gollum gollum gollum*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Fain will not end up like Gollum. Though Harriet said he is even crazier than how he was shown in Prologue.

#### Ted Herman

EDIT to clarify and correct: Brandon rewrote his original submission of Fain's scene based on Harriet's comments that he wasn't portrayed as crazy enough.
