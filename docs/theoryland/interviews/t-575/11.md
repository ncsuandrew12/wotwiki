# [Interview #575: TOM Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=575#11)

#### Ted Herman

Regarding timeline in
*Towers of Midnight*
, what can you say about how each person's plot arc lined up?

#### Maria Simons and Alan Romanczuk

There was a gap for some of the main story lines for about 1.5-2 weeks of only off-screen activity before the big meetup at Merrilor. Lan's trip from World's End to Tarwin's Gap took 100 days, and it lined him up with the other plotlines at that point. The whole gang can jump right into Tarmon Gai'don!
