#### Ted Herman

Some other people of note were in attendance besides Team Jordan, including Emily, Charlain Harris (who wrote some vampire novels I hear), Peter V. Brett (who was at the NY Comic Con, and wrote
*The Warded Man*
), Leigh Butler (our fellow famous Storm Leader), Tom Doherty (who was kind enough to sign my
*Towers of Midnight*
) and the whole team from Tor as well.
