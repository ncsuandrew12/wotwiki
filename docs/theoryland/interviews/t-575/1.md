# [Interview #575: TOM Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=575#1)

#### Ted Herman

Signing report:

Got there two hours early, met up with some of the Storm Leaders from last year and talked about
*Towers of Midnight*
briefly which was nice, got my bracelet to be allowed in. The venue was smaller than the one from last year so a lot of people had to wait outside the seating area which was not too nice, since they could not hear the reading and Q&A through the glass walls surrounding the small auditorium. I heard lots of complaints, and may send one to Barnes and Noble and see if they can avoid this kind of situation for the
*A Memory of Light*
Tour.

Recording was prohibited except for the Tower Guards, so I took notes, and I think I got all the questions.

Harriet read Lan's scene in the Prologue, which was nice, one of the buildups to my favorite scene in the book.

Then the Q&A:
