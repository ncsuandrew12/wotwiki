#### Question

Are there Wolfsisters? Could an Ogier become a Wolfbrother/sister?

#### Robert Jordan

There are no known Wolfsisters so far, but there is no reason there couldn’t be a Wolfsister. Ogier, however, cannot become linked to wolves in this way. Theirs is a different way than that of humankind.
