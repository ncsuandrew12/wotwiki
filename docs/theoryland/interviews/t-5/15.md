#### Question

In the scene during which the taint is cleansed, Cadsuane uses a
*ter’angreal*
that detects the One Power being channeled and the direction it is coming from. She watches the
*ter’angreal*
, and when the enemy channels, she points, and someone attacks. Why doesn’t it point to the huge amounts of the One Power that Rand and Nynaeve are channeling – far more than the Forsaken are being pegged for?

#### Robert Jordan

Cadsuane’s
*ter’angreal*
was made during the Breaking of the World, at a time when men and women no longer linked, or at least very rarely, since male channelers were going mad at a rate of knots. What the maker was particularly interested in detecting was men channeling, but a man channeling in combination with a woman was, by definition, safe, because no woman was going to link with a man unless she knew absolutely that he was sane and not going to go over the edge into insanity while they were linked. Thus,
*saidin*
and
*saidar*
being worked in combination could be ignored, and in fact would be a distraction, since this was and is a warning device. Cadsuane’s
*ter’angreal*
won’t point to the two halves of the Power being wielded in combination.
