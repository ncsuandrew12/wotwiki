# [Interview #5: COT: 'Glimmers' Ebook Q&A, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=5#16)

#### Question

Does
*ta’veren*
-ness ebb and flow as needed? If Rand, Mat, and Perrin were all
*ta’veren*
growing up, it seems that the Two Rivers would have had a lot of odd events occurring, but no mention is made of it.

#### Robert Jordan

You might say that
*ta’veren*
-ness ebbs and flows. For one thing, remember that even for someone like Rand, the effects are really occasional, not continuous. Even when he is causing dozens of coincidences in a particular place, many more events pass off quite normally. For another thing, no one is born
*ta’veren*
. Rand, Mat, and Perrin only became
*ta’veren*
just before Moiraine appeared. You become
*ta’veren*
according to the needs of the Wheel. Like the Heroes linked to the Wheel, who are spun out as needed to try to keep the weaving of the Pattern straight, a man or woman becomes
*ta’veren*
because the Wheel has “decided” to use them as an influence on the Pattern. And, no, the Wheel isn’t sentient. Think more of a fuzzy logic device that uses feedback to correct what it is doing in order to do it in the most efficient way.
