# [Interview #5: COT: 'Glimmers' Ebook Q&A, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=5#12)

#### Question

Are any of your characters or cultures designed to pay specific homage to any particular work or author?

#### Robert Jordan

No. In the first chapters of
*The Eye of the World*
, I tried for a Tolkienesque feel without trying to copy Tolkien’s style, but that was by way of saying to the reader, okay, this is familiar, this is something you recognize, now let’s go where you haven’t been before. I like taking a familiar theme, something people think they know and know where it must be heading, then standing it on its ear or giving it a twist that subverts what you thought you knew. I must admit that I occasionally drop in a reference—for example, there’s an inn called The Nine Rings, and Loial is seen reading a book entitled
*To Sail Beyond the Sunset*
—but it isn’t a regular thing by any means.

#### Footnote

*To Sail Beyond the Sunset*
is a
[Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Sail_Beyond_the_Sunset)
reference, for those not familiar with his work. RJ is speaking here of references to contemporary culture; obviously the references to myth and legend are rather pervasive.
