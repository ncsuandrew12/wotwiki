#### Question

Did you see the Lord of the Rings movie? What did you think of it? What is your favorite fantasy movie?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, yes; Harriet and I only waited long enough for the crowds to thin out a little before we went. After all, we both read the books the first time back when they first became available in the United States, and I myself have re-read them perhaps a dozen times since. I thought the movie was most excellent! It is well-crafted and well-acted, it follows the books to a fair degree, and the changes, for the most part, were necessary to fit it into a reasonable length for a movie. Making Arwen more prominent was necessary, too, since she is barely there in the book, but at least they resisted the temptation to make her a sword-babe, though it appears that took quite an effort. At the moment, I would have to say that my favorite fantasy movies are
*Fellowship of the Ring*
and
*Excalibur*
, an old film about King Arthur. Rent it some time and take a look.
