#### Question

Do other authors offer you advice or suggestions on how to write your books?

#### Robert Jordan

Iâ€™m not quite sure what I would say to another writer who offered me suggestions on how to write my books. When you are first starting out, you try to learn from other people, but once you get to a certain point, learning becomes more a matter of honing your own skills, and your confidence has usually advanced by this time to the point where you no longer seek the advice of others.
