# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#19)

#### Question

If you don’t finish all of your books in the series that you’re in, would you be willing to give that opportunity to someone else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah of course, I’d be a complete hypocrite if I wasn’t, right? [Laughs] Yeah totally, I’ll have like one of these guys write it. [Points to Josh and Mi’ch] We’ll call up Pat Rothfuss, “Hey Pat,” and then you’ll get it in like thirty years.
