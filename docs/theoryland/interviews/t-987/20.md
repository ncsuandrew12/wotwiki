# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#20)

#### Question

When you were talking about the Rithmatist, you said that he wasn’t genetically capable of doing magic and I was wondering if you actually had like a genetic system for how...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, this one actually isn’t genetic. I said genetic, but it’s not. But I don’t want to give away what it is that makes someone use the magic in that world. I did actually develop a genetic magic system that was very interesting that is in a book that didn’t get published.

#### QUESTION

Is it going to get published?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Probably not, but I might recycle the magic eventually.
