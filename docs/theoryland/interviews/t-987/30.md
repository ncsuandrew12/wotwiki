#### Question

How do you buy a contract with a kandra in Alloy of Law time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You don’t, good question. There’s two of them in Alloy of Law. Shadows of Self has quite a big part with a kandra.

#### Footnote

The two kandra in Alloy of Law were TenSoon as Constable Brettin in the end and MeLaan as the woman who gave Wax his Pathian earring.
