# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#28)

#### Question

I would like to know how you met Patrick Rothfuss, how did you guys become friends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first time we met was actually on the forums for a webcomic.

#### QUESTION

Which webcomic?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Penny Arcade. Because I occasionally go to- Penny Arcade had a writing forum and I would occasionally go to the writing forums. I wouldn’t hang out on most other forums, but any place that had an active writing forum I hung out on, I like to chat with people about writing and things like that.
And Pat got on and gave somebody feedback. Somebody else trashed him for his feedback. And I wrote back to Pat and said, “Don’t listen to him, your feedback was awesome and also if you’re who I think you are, your book’s really good.” And that was back when it was only out in hardcover, he didn’t take off until his book came out in paperback. That’s when he got really popular. So, it was before he was popular. But he’d made waves already in the publishing community. And so he wrote back and said, “Wow, who are you?” And we just started chatting and then we started hanging out at cons after that.
