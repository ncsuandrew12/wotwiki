# [Interview #987, Entry #7]: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#7)

#### Question

Okay Hoid, you mentioned he's in all your books, is he in also in all your shorter stories?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is not in all of my shorter stories. In fact, he is not in any book that references Earth. So if there's a reference to Earth- most of my science fiction has referential stuff to Earth, Alcatraz is like this. He's not in anything like that. He's not in the Wheel of Time. It would not have been appropriate for me to seed something like that into a Wheel of Time book. So he's not in Steelheart or the other children works that I've done. But he is in all my epic fantasies.

#### QUESTION

Now my main question actually, which magic systems, if any, does he have access to?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That's an excellent question. He is familiar with very many of them, and lots that you haven't seen yet.
