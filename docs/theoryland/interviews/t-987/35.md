# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#35)

#### Question

Shardplate, does it have to be fitted by a smith or does it just kind of magically...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It magically fits to you.

#### JOSH

I’d like to see it fit to someone three foot tall.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

If it’s within reason, it can fit.

#### QUESTION

But they do weld stuff to it to it?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

They weld stuff to it to ornament it.

#### QUESTION

But that doesn’t really stick?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It won’t stay, it can get cut off and things like that. Yeah, and they paint them and things.

#### QUESTION

So the actual color is gray, right?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Dalinar’s color is the actual color.

#### QUESTION

He doesn’t have it painted, yeah. It’s kind of stone, right?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It’s not really stone, it’s more like a deep metallic, like an unbuffed steel sort of metallic. A dark charcoal metallic.
