# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#11)

#### Question

How long on the Emperor's Soul, from having it pop into your head in Taiwan to getting it on the page, about how long are you looking at it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

How long am I looking at it? This was thirty thousand words, I'd say probably two to three weeks actual writing time and then, you know, several drafts after that. About an equal time in revision is usually what it takes me on a book. So, probably this is a month and half's worth of work. The thing about that is it was spread between times when I was sending drafts to Harriet and having an open moment to sit down and, you know like, "Well I can't be working on the next draft of the Wheel of Time because I just sent this one in. I need to see what her response to these changes is, so I will take these three days and I will work on Emperor's Soul." And that's where it came from. Filling in the gaps, yeah. It's like pouring milk into the jar full of marbles, that's where, you know, this came from.
