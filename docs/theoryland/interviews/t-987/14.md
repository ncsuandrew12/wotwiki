# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#14)

#### Question

When does Emperor's Soul take place in relation to the events of Elantris?

#### Brandon Sanderson

After them.

#### QUESTION

Like how long after?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I haven't answered that yet.

[Laughter]

A lot of people keep asking. But after them, but not so far after them that the technology level has shifted, which I allow, in my worlds, to happen. And also not so far after that the Emperor's Soul- if you keep your eyes open you will see a Derethi priest in full armor. And so, not so far after that the kingdoms we are familiar with no longer exist. They do exist and the tech level has not shifted dramatically so you can use that to kind of ballpark for yourself, a range. It's certainly not thousands of years later, in other words.
