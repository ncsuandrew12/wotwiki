# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#23)

#### Question

Do you have any advice for approaching agents?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Have you listened to my podcast or watched my-?

#### QUESTION

I’m familiar with it, Writing Excuses?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

We have a couple agents on, you can go look for those agent podcasts and we interview them about what should new authors do, that can be helpful. I have an entire university lecture on agents at writeaboutdragons, and it’s like an hour of me talking about approaching agents and what they do and things like that. The only piece I can give you right now is try and find a way that you can make a personal connection with them. Try and go to a con that they’re at, follow their blog, read books by their authors, have some sort of personal connection so you can know who they are rather than just submitting blind.
