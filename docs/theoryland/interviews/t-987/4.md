# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#4)

#### Question

Who was the first Feruchemist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Who was the first Feruchemist? I don't have their name written down. [Laughter] It's fairly ancient of date.

#### QUESTION

Were they born or were they created?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

The first Feruchemist, were they born or created? Both. [Laughter] I don't see those two as mutually exclusive. See how good I am at dodging questions, now? I've been dealing with the Wheel of Time fans long enough. They've really whipped me into shape for dodging questions. Anything else? I promise not to dodge all of them
