#### Question

How is Birthright coming?

#### Brandon Sanderson

How is Birthright coming? Birthright has been, unofficially, moved back to 2014 in anticipation of the new console generation. I don't know that that's official, I don't even know that the new consoles are official or that we even know when they're coming, but the fact that the WiiU is coming out makes us think that we want a little extra time on Birthright. So, that's the Mistborn video game.
