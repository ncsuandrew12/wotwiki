# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#16)

#### Question

Do you mind if I ask a Wheel of Time question?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I don't mind at all.

#### QUESTION

The group that I'm a part of on Facebook has a list going of things we want to ask you.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Ooooh, okay!

#### QUESTION

So I'm trying to ask one that's not gonna get a Read And Find Out.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Okay.

#### QUESTION

Do the women in Randland shave?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

[Laughter] Wow, I've never been asked that. Oh wow, I don't know. I honestly don't know.

#### QUESTION

It's been bothering me since I started the series.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Wow. That's an excellent question. Ask Maria, she might actually know. That's the sort of thing that's probably buried in the notes somewhere. You can ask another one since I didn't know. You can go down a few and if I have to RAFO, then I will but is there another one you can ask that might get an answer?

#### QUESTION

Maybe, you're going to have to forgive me if I mispronounce...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That's all right.

#### QUESTION

What did Moridin mean by the Fisher King being a dim remnant of a memory of Rand al'Thor?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

There are lots of ways to interpret that I will give you one interpretation. And that is that it is a memory from the last time that Rand al'Thor did what he did. And that those stories were passed on and passed on and so now he is following legends about himself. Does that make sense?

#### QUESTION

Yeah.
