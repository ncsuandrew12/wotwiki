# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#24)

#### Question

How involved were you in the development of the adventure game?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Medium level, in that I would go and say, “This is the type of role playing game I like,” and then they would come back and say, “Here’s the mechanics we're thinking of using.” and I’d say, “Hey, that’s cool...” So I did get to sign off on it.
