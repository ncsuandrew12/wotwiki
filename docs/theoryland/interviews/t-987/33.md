# [Interview #987, Entry #33]: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#33)

#### Question

Do you have any inclination and/or permission to write anything after A Memory of Light or involved in the same world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not have permission or inclination. Mostly because I don’t think that Robert Jordan would have wanted it to continue. If Harriet decides she wants to do more I would probably say yes, if she asked me, to the prequels, because we at least know he wanted to do those. But my instinct says we should just let it be done.

We might see them as video games. I really would love to see them done as videogames. Because that’s not canon, but you can still experience the story. Anyway, something like that.
