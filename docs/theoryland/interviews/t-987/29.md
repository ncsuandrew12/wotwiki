#### Question

The question is, can you read it (the Alethi alphabet)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can’t read it, Isaac can.

#### JOSH

Isaac can’t read it.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Can’t he?

#### Josh

No.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He came up with it!

I told you where it came from, the writing system, right? That I told Isaac, “I want it to look like waveforms,” and he developed it to look like waveforms on the little thing when you speak voice- and things like that, and that was my goal for the [writing] system was something that was a line with waveforms across it. And he developed it then.
