#### Question

How do you keep your characters straight, among all the characters that you have to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I donâ€™t know, it just happens. Characters are just one of those things. Like I always have trouble describing how I write my characters, because characters just kind of happen. I plan my plots, I plan my worlds, and characters I write my way into to make them work. And I have a hard time explaining to people how I develop them. They just are who they are, if that makes sense.
