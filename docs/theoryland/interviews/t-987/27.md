# [Interview #987: Weller Book Works Signing - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=987#27)

#### Question

In the prologue it sounds like Lews Therin balefires himself, and then is reborn as Rand al’Thor.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He does not balefire himself, so I can answer that. He does not.

#### QUESTION

So it’s just something that sounds a lot like balefire?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes- well there’s various interpretations of what happens there. He um- yeah there’s various interpretations of what actually killed him. If you go look and read closely, what actually killed him may be- could be subject to some debate.
