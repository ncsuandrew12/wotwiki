# [Interview #352: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Progress Bar Moving Again, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=352#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Last week, with the pile of final papers I had to grade (thirty pages from thirty students, so around a thousand pages of reading material plus computations of final grades and all of that) I only managed to get 3k written. (My weekly goal is 10k.) Fortunately, with the previous week's extra writing (I think I did closer to 15 or 16k that week) I'm still pretty much on target. I did 1k earlier today, so that—with last week's—gets us one more blip forward on the progress bar.
