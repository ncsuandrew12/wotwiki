#### [QuestionÂ ()](https://twitter.com/grantosan/status/288818013782818816)

How do you get to be an editor for an author like RJ?

#### Harriet McDougal

I started a long time ago when dinosaurs roamed the earth! Worked my way up.

#### Footnote

Harriet was already an established editor when she met RJ; it was RJ who was just starting out as an author. See
