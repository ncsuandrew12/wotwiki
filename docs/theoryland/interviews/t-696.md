My assistant has put up a new
[Twitter posts collection](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/98/Tweets-December-19-21-2011)
that includes
[my live-tweeting](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#65)
of finishing the first draft of
*A Memory of Light*
. If you want to cut to the chase, the part you really want to read is here below. I'll post more details later.

#### Footnote

Brandon posted a portion of his Tweets about finishing the first draft of
*A Memory of Light*
in this blog entry. Since they are included
[elsewhere in the database](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#65)
, they have not been reproduced here.
