#### Robert Moreau

Hello all,

I just got back from the LA signing, I am currently uploading the Q&A to you tube, it will take an estimated 500 minutes and I started about 1:15 am PST but here is the link: http://youtu.be/zDPQ4i1zYxk

Terez wanted me to ask if Perrin's soul and Hopper's are bound.

## Entry #3

#### Robert Moreau

The person before me asked why Demandred did not use the True Power during the Last Battle.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said he was wary of the True Power and everything that came with it. "He may have been the smartest of all the Forsaken for not wanting to use the True Power."

## Entry #4

#### Robert Moreau

I asked Harriet what made Jim want to write fantasy.

#### Harriet McDougal

She said that originally he was against it, but she got him to write a Conan book, and he loved it and kept writing fantasy. So we have her to thank even more then just being an awesome editor.

## Entry #5

#### Robert Moreau

During my second pass through the line I mentioned
[I was a redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1866a4/sandersons_qa_from_la_020813/?sort=old)
and he asked if he ever replied to one of my threads. I had posted a copy of
[Terez's quote collection of Jordan saying "Three more books" from 1995â€“2007](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/14q354/so_how_long_is_the_series_going_to_be_rjs_answers/)
. He then told the story that Tom told him of RJ pitching the series:

#### Brandon Sanderson

(paraphrasing Tom Doherty) "So Jim came and pitched me a trilogy, and he started telling me the story of this boy who is destined to save the world but has to die and gave a quick over view of the first book that ended with the boy pulling a sword that is not a sword from a stone that is not a stone." Now Tom knew that Jim liked to write long and offered him a contract for six books; Jim refused saying it was a trilogy, but Tom convinced him sign for six. He thought he was soooo smart getting Jim to sign for six books at beginning authors royalties, little did he know it would be another eight to finish the series.

how many more books?

## Entry #6

#### Robert Moreau

Also after everyone was done, I hung out with the Memory Keepers (as i had won a shirt in SLC and blended in) and there were some questions asked about Moridin wanting to die forever.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said that no he did not get his wish.

#### Robert Moreau

I asked if Moridin had been on Dragonmount and had the opportunity that Rand had to end it all, would he.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said yes he would have.

## Entry #7

#### Robert Moreau

The Memory Keepers where also asked to try and gather a list of the characters we would like to know the fates of and he would pass it along to Maria/Hariet to try and get those answered in the encyclopedia. There is a thread
[on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/184ehg/curious_about_what_happened_to_certain_individuals/)
for those who have accounts, but I am sure one can be started here as well.

## Entry #8

#### Robert Moreau

That's all I can remember off the top of my head, the Memory Keepers said they would be compiling notes for the next couple days and maybe post a recap within the week.

Edit: the video is now live.
