# [Interview #561: TOM Signing Report - Catherine Sedai, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=561#10)

#### Question

A guy named Louis asked what's going to happen to Bela. (He pronounces it like "Bella".)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet corrects his pronunciation (it's more like BAIL-a) and then, looking mysterious, asks "Would you believe that Bela is the Dark One?" (everybody laughs)
