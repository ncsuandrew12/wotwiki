# [Interview #561: TOM Signing Report - Catherine Sedai, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=561#9)

#### Question

Someone asked him if he would do the evil Forsaken laugh he was purported to have done at some earlier time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon does an evil Mwa-ha-ha MWa-HA-HA laugh (hilarious), and everybody cheers. Then Brandon turns to the guy filming the event and says, "Oh no, you're getting this on film" (laughs) "Any chance we can edit that out?" (joking. Camera man shakes his head no. Brandon laughs)
