# [Interview #561: TOM Signing Report - Catherine Sedai, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=561#7)

#### Question

Somebody asked who his least favorite character is to write.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said it was probably Gawyn. He said when you write a character, you try to think like them, and Gawyn is so frustrated with his situation that Brandon would get frustrated writing him. He asked Harriet to tell a funny story about Jim.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Jim would get into his characters so much that sometimes when he came to dinner I could tell who he had been writing. For example he would come in kinda hunched and slinking around near the walls and I would say "Have you been writing Padan Fain?" (Harriet and Brandon laugh)
