# [Interview #561: TOM Signing Report - Catherine Sedai, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=561#2)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet read an excerpt from Distinctions (pg. 43-45, Padan Fain)
  
Her phone rings near the beginning of the reading, and without missing a beat, she picks it up and passes it over to Brandon, still reading aloud. She didn't stop until the crowd started to laugh, and then she laughed too. She stopped for a moment and says "Well, we'll just pretend that didn't happen shall we." And continues. (Harriet read this great passage AMAZINGLY. It's not surprising, but it was awesome.)
