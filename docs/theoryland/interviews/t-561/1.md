# [Interview #561: TOM Signing Report - Catherine Sedai, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=561#1)

#### Catherine Sedai

The signing today was in Dallas, at Borders Bookstore.

Bob Kluttz, one of Jim's (RJ's) friends, lives in Texas, and he just happened to want to attend the event. Brandon asked him to sign copies of
*Towers of Midnight*
. RJ had Bob on several of his dedication pages in other books, and Brandon has him in the
*Towers of Midnight*
dedication. Bob was a good friend he bounced ideas around with, who he attributes some of his success.
