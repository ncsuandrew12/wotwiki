Somebody asked who his favorite
[villain](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/53029-tom-signing-tour-reports/page__st__20#entry1663013)
is to write.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He says that he enjoys a lot of them, but that writing Padan Fain is very enjoyable, because by this point in the story he is just bonkers (his word) so it's fun to write such an insane perspective. He said specifically, the excerpt Harriet read aloud was pretty much his favorite to write. (
