# [Interview #561, Entry #11]: TOM Signing Report - Catherine Sedai](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=561#11)

#### Catherine Sedai

Those were the highlights of the Q&A, which was not very long.

For those of you who haven't gone to one of these events, they distribute post-its and ask you to write your name, and anything you want Brandon to write in your book. I just wrote my name, as I couldn't choose any one thing I would like him to write, but Brandon still jotted down a little something for me.

In my copy of
*The Gathering Storm*
, he wrote: To Catherine, May you always find water & shade.

In my copy of
*Towers of Midnight*
, he wrote: To Catherine, Iron to Bind!

Harriet signed both of my books, and Bob Kluttz signed my
*Towers of Midnight*
.

This is the first time I have gone to one of these things. I wish, and hope, that every fan has an opportunity like this one. It was absolutely incredible. Next year's
*A Memory of Light*
tour is supposed to be pretty huge, so hopefully most people who want to go will have an opportunity.

The photo I linked below was taken on my cell phone, and I was off to the side of a very big crowd, but there was nobody in front of me.
