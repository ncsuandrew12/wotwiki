# [Interview #957: AMOL Signing Report - BlairJ, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=957#2)

#### BlairJ

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I did ask about
*Mistborn: Birthright*
and apparently it is going to make it's way to the next generation of consoles, so it should be a very nice representation. I did find out that Brandon is still writing 100% of the dialogue (there were some rumors a while back that he wouldn't be) and that it is well underway.
