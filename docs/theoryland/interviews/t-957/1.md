# [Interview #957: AMOL Signing Report - BlairJ, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=957#1)

#### BlairJ

I have long been a lurker on these forums (a long time), but I thought I would break my silence as I happened to be at the Baltimore signing. I thought about calling out to see if anyone there was a member of the 17th Shard forums (I figured there would be a few).
