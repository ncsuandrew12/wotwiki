# [Interview #65: ACOS Signing Report - Brian Ritchie, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#2)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ wrote the Mat/Tylin scenario as a humorous role-reversal thing. His editor, and wife, thought it was a good discussion of sexual harassment and rape with comic undertones. She liked it because it dealt with very serious issues in a humorous way. She seemed to think it would be a good way to explain to men/boys what this can be like for women/girls, showing the fear, etc.
