# [Interview #65: ACOS Signing Report - Brian Ritchie, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#13)

#### Brian Ritchie

I think that's all that was said of any significance. The rest was personal info that I don't think is important here, and I'm not sure a lot of this was either. BTW, both Mr. and Mrs. RJ are very friendly, outgoing people and were fun to talk with.

Am I the only one that thinks he looks like an older Bayle Domon?

This could lead to some interesting speculations. From his web site picture, I'd say Novak might be related.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ seems to actually like the DKS covers. However, he disliked the cover of one of his books that someone brought. (I believe it was the UK version of
*The Great Hunt*
.) It was mostly light blue and lavender/purple. He disliked the artwork, not just the color scheme.
