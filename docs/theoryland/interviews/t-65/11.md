# [Interview #65: ACOS Signing Report - Brian Ritchie, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#11)

#### Robert Jordan

He talked a little about his next series,
*Shipwrecked*
. It will be in a different universe, and focuses on a group of shipwrecked people (surprise, surprise). They come from a land with many countries, but basically all ruled by one religion that dominates everywhere. The new place has three powerful countries, but temples to hundreds of different gods and goddesses. It's going to talk a lot about culture shock I think.
