# [Interview #65: ACOS Signing Report - Brian Ritchie, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#4)

#### Brian Ritchie

He gave the following answers to questions from various people.

#### Robert Jordan

His opinion of newsgroup FAQs he has read are so-so. First, he gets them from several groups he says. Us and the alt group and ???. He says the FAQs are about 1/3 correct, 1/3 close but not quite and 1/3 wrong. He feels that some things that are obvious to the casual reader have been over analyzed and led to incorrect conclusions. I don't know if he has read the latest version of our FAQ and if it was better than the above stats.
