# [Interview #65: ACOS Signing Report - Brian Ritchie, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#6)

#### Robert Jordan

There will be a few more books, some, not a lot, hopefully fewer than seven more.

He knows the final scene of the last book, all the major events he wants to have happen and who will live and who will die. When he starts a book, he decides which of these events he wants to try to do and then writes it so they happen.

He will tie up all the major plot lines, but will leave a lot of the minor ones unresolved. He finds it too unrealistic for a series to end with all of life's problems solved. Expect the series to end with the major problems solved, but a lot of people will still have tumultuous lives ahead of them.
