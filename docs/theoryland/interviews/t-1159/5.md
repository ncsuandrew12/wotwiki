When someone is inside a time bubble where time is going faster, do they age more quickly than they would outside?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### BeskarKomrk

So there's a sort of relativistic effect going on there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I tried to keep it as close as possible to the actual effects. The only thing I didn't include, I think, is the red-shift of light when it leaves the bubble, because that would irradiate everything around it.
