# [Interview #1159: Shadows of Self-Brookline, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1159#13)

#### Question

I've been listening to the audiobooks of Stormlight. There are some really great character voices. Have you told him how to do the characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not told him how to do characters. I leave that to him. I give him pronunciations.

#### Question

So the Australian Lopen is all him.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the Australian is all him. Which is weird, because they're, they're based off of Hispanic cultures, so, hearing the Australian - but at the same time, they're not Hispanic, because there are no Hispanics on Roshar, so an Australian's probably just as accurate as anything else. But yes, I intended the Herdazians to have a Hispanic flair to them.
