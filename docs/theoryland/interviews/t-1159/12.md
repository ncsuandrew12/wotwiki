#### Question

How does the density of Roshar compare to the density of Earth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Roshar's density? So, Roshar is less dense than Earth. As well as being a bit smaller. I mean, we're at .7 gravity, so you can run the numbers. I'm sure the people on here (nods at my smartphone) will. And they'll figure that out.
