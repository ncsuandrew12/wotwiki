#### AndrewStirlingMacDonald

Yes. I have a question about the way that the brass symbol changed. It looks like brass no longer has a dot. Can you talk about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is just Issac deciding how he wants the symbols to look. It is nothing of Cosmerilogical import.

#### AndrewStirlingMacDonald

Is there anything of cosmerilogical import about the way that the symbols have changed over time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, slight import. I mean, it's just the idea that as things have evolved, and we are moving toward typesetting; we've moved into typesetting in the modern era, you're going to see the symbols change to kind of match different eras.
