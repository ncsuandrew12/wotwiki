#### Question

Who is your favorite living author?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Favorites right now, writing. Probably my favorite right now is Guy Gabriel Kay. It was Terry Pratchet until he passed away. And it was Robert Jordan until HE passed away. So I hope Guy stays safe. Because getting picked as my favorite author is apparently a death sentence.
