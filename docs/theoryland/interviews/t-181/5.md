# [Interview #181: COT Book Tour Wrap-up, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=181#5)

#### Robert Jordan

I did have some people mention your movie. Not just the folks who came to various signings who are associated with it, either. I think there are people out there eagerly awaiting it.

Take care, Jason. It's back to work for the likes of me. No rest for the wicked. I really hope—knock wood, spit over your shoulder, and sacrifice to the gods—that I can finish up in twelve books total. We shall see.

#### Footnote

This was in reference to Dragonmount's first 'trailer'-type film.
