#### Day 30

**First Memory:**
  
Rand strode forward, lifting his arms out to the sides. Grass sprouted in waves, red blossoms burst from the ground like a blush upon the land. The storm stilled, the dark clouds burned away by light. (p. 137)

**Second Memory:**
  
A joyful song, a song of awe and wonder, though she could not understand the words. (p. 194)
