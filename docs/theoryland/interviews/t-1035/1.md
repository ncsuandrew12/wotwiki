# [Interview #1035: Pocatello Signing Report - Lady Radagu, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1035#1)

#### Question

Can AonDor heal chronic conditions, like poor eyesight? If so, does it require specialized Aon drawing to work, or will enough Aon Iens do the job eventually?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, AonDor could cure a chronic condition like poor eyesight. But you would have to get the specifics of everything, kind of like they're equations, correct. You'd have to know a LOT about AonDor and a LOT about the body to get it right. (Here Brandon paused in thought) It's kind of like with computer programming.
