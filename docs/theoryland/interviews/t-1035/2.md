#### Question

Would a full lashing work in a vacuum? If not, is that because it works by creating a vacuum between the lashed objects?

#### Brandon Sanderson

First, good question. The way lashings work, it does have to do with pressure. But I can't go into it. I'm going to have to RAFO that one. Again, good question.
