# [Interview #70: ACOS Signing Report - Dean West, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=70#4)

#### Question

Are you going to conclude each plot? Little and big? (He really doesn't like when authors do this!)

#### Robert Jordan

No. I plan to leave some things left unanswered (Asmodean??? Arrgh!) I do not like it when other authors clean every little thread up. It is too clean. It isn't very realistic of problems, especially problems of this magnitude. They just don't
*always*
get solved. Also, I plan to leave the very last scene with a big hook leaving you with a great big question. (After he said this his wife looked at him and said, "Really?")
