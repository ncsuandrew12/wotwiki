#### Question

If you were unable to complete the series who would finish it up?

#### Robert Jordan

(Very strongly) No one. If something happens to me I have a friend who has agreed to go over to my house and format my computer three times.

*is*
on a computer...any hackers out there in South Carolina?) ;-)
