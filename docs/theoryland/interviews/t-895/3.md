#### Mike Cockrum

*Tel'aran'rhiod*
to find something to do with The One Power that would help Rand. The end result of this was them discovering the Bowl of the Winds. First, though, she went to the Objects of Power storeroom of the White Tower. What was the thing in the Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)
