# [Interview #845: Idaho Falls Signing Report - PrncRny, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=845#1)

#### PrncRny

I'm fairly certain this is spoiler free. If someone thinks otherwise, feel free to move the thread, but I'm pretty darn confident in it.

Content is about WoT, Mistborn, AND Stormlight, a few questions from each.

I'll just post the WoT related ones here. If people want Stormlight or Mistborn questions, let me know and I'll add those in.
