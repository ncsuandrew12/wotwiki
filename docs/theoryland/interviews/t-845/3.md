# [Interview #845: Idaho Falls Signing Report - PrncRny, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=845#3)

#### PrncRny

I was thinking about the Bloodknives' rings. What are the stones that they have? Are they Shayol Ghul rocks or something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*long pause\* Finding Shayol Ghul rocks in Seanchan hands would be a very difficult thing.

#### PrncRny

So that's a no.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't say no. I just said it would be a very difficult thing.
