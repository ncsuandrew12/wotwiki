# [Interview #845: Idaho Falls Signing Report - PrncRny, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=845#5)

#### PrncRny

Do we ever find out how strong in the power Tuon would be if she ever snapped and started channeling? Did RJ leave any notes about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes he did. The problem is that that's not the sort of thing I can work into the books very easily. The issue is that her strength would be tied to, well, people's strength go up they practice and things. Yes he has the notes, but there's no way the characters can know for sure. That would be something for the outriggers, which maybe we can get into the encyclopedia. He left a big list for everyone and a number for their power level, their strength in the One Power, just for comparison's sake, which was cool because it would also say 'Here's the threshold for creating a gateway and here's the threshold for this' and its a really cool list and I hope they put it into the encyclopaedia but I don't know if they will.

#### PrncRny

Ok, so she's not going to snap in the next one and start channeling?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well. Even if she did, how powerful she would get would not be immediately evident. Does that make sense?
