## Entry #1

#### Marie Curie

These are snippets posted by Orbit Books on YouTube over the last couple of months from an interview of Brandon in London (he was there in June 2011). Orbit seems to just be posting bits of the interview to increase the anticipation for
*A Memory of Light*
, or something.

## Entry #2

#### Marie Curie

Here's the first one, posted 14 October 2011. It's basically just a plug to look out for promotional stuff over the next year or so. I do like how it displays at the end that
*A Memory of Light*
is coming out in November 2012. And I was also amused by Brandon's glasses being crooked...

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is Brandon Sanderson, sitting here in London as we begin the last year until the Wheel of Time finally ends. This is a very bittersweet experience for a lot of us. I know a lot of you have been reading the books for quite a long time. I started them myself back in, boy, 1990, so we're coming to the end. And as this last year passes, we will be doing lots of fun events. You can watch the Orbit web site for all sorts of interesting promotions. And, as we launch
*Towers of Midnight*
in paperback, we're going to do all sorts of fun promotions.

## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

But mostly, I guess I just wanted to say that this is your last chance to read the series before the end comes. And so, read along with me. Read along with the other fans as we approach this final book,
*A Memory of Light*
, which will be coming out some time in 2012.

## Entry #4

#### Marie Curie

And....here's the second snippet, posted a few days ago (12 December 2011). I hope that Brandon eventually agreed to have some of Harriet's bean soup...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I got to read the ending–what?–four years ago now. I don't know if you've heard that story, but I went to visit Charleston for the first time in December of 2007, so almost exactly four years ago now. I met Harriet at the airport, she picked me up. And it had been a long flight, I'd been without food for a while. And she drove me back to her house, this wonderful home in Charleston–it was built in the 1700s–just gorgeous town home. And she said, "Do you want dinner?" as we pulled up. And she said, "I have some bean soup that I made, it's quite good." I said, "Actually, I want the ending." And she laughed and she went and fetched that for me, and I got to read. Sit down and find out who killed Asmodean, find out the fates of all the characters. And read all of this, in mostly note form. So I did get that. But I don't get to read the ending.

## Entry #5

#### Brandon Sanderson

It feels very comforting at least that fans have liked these last ones as much as they had, and that the reception has been good. I can only hope that you all will enjoy the ending as much as you've enjoyed the last books. I will tell you this: I found the ending incredibly satisfying. When I got there, and I sat and I read that alone quietly, and actually in Robert Jordan's chair, in his room, just a few feet from the computer he'd written a lot of the books on. I felt immensely and deeply satisfied with this conclusion that he wrote himself. It feels right to me. And so, I hope that you will have a similar experience.
