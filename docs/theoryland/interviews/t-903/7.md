# [Interview #903: Author Interview: Brandon Sanderson previews Steelheart, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=903#7)

How does your novel stand out from others in the genre?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's an excellent question. This is a somewhat crowded genre recently. Of course, dystopian fiction has always been popular in the SF/fantasy field, but lately it's had quite a boom. I am the only one that I know of doing a superhero apocalypse. I wrote the book because one day I was driving down the road and someone cut me off in traffic, and I thought, "It's a good thing I'm not a supervillain, because I would totally blow up your car." The what-if for me on that wasâ€”what if someone could just blow up your car if you cut them off in traffic? How would that change the world? What would we do if people started getting super powers and just started taking whatever they wanted? Would we be able to stop them? What would happen if the government just declared them forces of nature, acts of God, something that can't be changed. It was an interesting enough premise that I wrote a book based around it, and that's where
*Steelheart*
came from. It's a premise that I haven't seen done before.
