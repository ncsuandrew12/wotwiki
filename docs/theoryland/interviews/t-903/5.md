#### Lenore Applehans

What are your top 5 Dystopian lit recs and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

These are in no particular order.
*1984*
has to be on the list; it was the first big dystopian book that I read, and it has shaped this genre, in a way. I would put up there
*The Giver*
as well, which most people count as dystopian; it's kind of an interesting blend of dystopian and other sub genres, but I enjoy it. Among more recent fiction, I would say
*Uglies*
by Scott Westerfeld, and
*The Maze Runner*
by James Dashner, for something very recent. Finally, another good classicâ€”probably my favorite of all time is
*Harrison Bergeron*
by Kurt Vonnegut.
