# [Interview #903, Entry #4]: Author Interview: Brandon Sanderson previews Steelheart](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=903#4)

#### Lenore Applehans

What fictional character from another book would your main character chose as his/her best friend and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think I would say Peter Parker. In
*Steelheart*
, David lives in a world where people gain super powers but only evil people have them. It would be one of his dreams to find people who were super-powered, yet were also good. Plus David's kind of a nerd in his own wayâ€”he's a nerd about super powers. He doesn't consider himself one, but he's studied super powers for most of his life to try to figure out how they work and how to defeat them. So I think he and Peter Parker would get along well.
