# [Interview #1090, Entry #1]: Idaho Falls Signing Report - Lady Radagu](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1090#1)

#### Lady Radagu

Were there Cadmium/Bendalloy and possibly Chromium/Nicrosil mistings in the Final Empire? If yes, were the mists Snapping those too?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Um, yes, there were, but since the mists were trying to create a pattern to be a sign, and people didn't know all the metals, they [the mists] had to use substitutions. They were acting the way we've seen other cognitive shadows, who are deceased, act.
