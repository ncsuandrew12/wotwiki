#### Jason Wolfbrother

Well when I went to the San Jose book signing for
*Knife of Dreams*
and got the chance to ask RJ the questions I brought I went 10 for 11 with only one RAFO. Unfortunately, I went one for two with Brandon Sanderson. One RAFO and one "she's on the right track" answer.

#### Terez

Aren't you going to tell us what the questions were?

#### Jason Wolfbrother

lol yeah I guess I could do that.
