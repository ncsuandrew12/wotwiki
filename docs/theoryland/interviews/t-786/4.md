#### Jason Wolfbrother

...anyway the question was if burned out channelers could be Healed as severed or stilled channelers could.

#### Brandon Sanderson

His answer, paraphrased because I wasn't recording and I was laughing at what he wrote was: "Nynaeve thinks that there is nothing that cannot be Healed. She was right about Healing Stilling and she is on the right track." But he didn't confirm or deny or RAFO whether burned out channelers could or could not be Healed.
