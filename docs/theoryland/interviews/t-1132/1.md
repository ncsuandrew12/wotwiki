# [Interview #1132: ConQuest Kansas City 2015, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1132#1)

#### Vaidd

I just got through the signing line. Since it was a mile long, I only asked about the Reckoners.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The ratio of Epics to normal folks is about 1 in 10,000. Brandon then clarified, without prompting, that was pre-Calamity population and the ratio is much higher now because so many normal people died. He then gave an example of Newcago, which has about 1000 Epics in a population of 250,000, so in that particular case the ratio is 1:250. (He didn't say, but I'd expect that to vary from place to place depending on the local politics.)
