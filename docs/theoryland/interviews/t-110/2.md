# [Interview #110: Sydney Independent Theatre Report - Paul Colquhoun, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=110#2)

#### Paul Colquhoun

Other observations/comments.

#### Robert Jordan

He does not plan to write any further books set in Randland after this series finishes, unless he has a flash of inspiration. RJ strongly implied that he didn't think this was likely, as it would need to be something very special/compelling. He has extensive notes on all the people/places on computer, but keeps all the plot lines in his head. He commented that he didn't think he could add any more plot threads without losing track! (Personally I find it hard enough to keep track while reading, let alone writing!). I asked him if he had considered publishing the notes after the series had finished. He said it would amount to something like an encyclopaedia, and that he didn't think there would be much interest... I tried to let him know that there were many fans who would lap it up. We may need to bring this up again later, if it hasn't already been done. Can we get his publishers to suggest it to him?
