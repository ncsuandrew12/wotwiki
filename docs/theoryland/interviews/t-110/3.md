# [Interview #110, Entry #3]: Sydney Independent Theatre Report - Paul Colquhoun](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=110#3)

#### Paul Colquhoun

RJ was obviously being careful to limit his answers to material in the already published books. He paused several times before answering, and was very non-committal in places (RAFO).

#### Robert Jordan

In answer to a question about the absence of Mat from the last book, RJ pointed out that Mat had just had a wall dropped on him and deserved some time off to rest and recover. At least one person in the front row was taping the Q&A session on a dictaphone, so there may be a transcript somewhere. I lost track of them during the signing afterwards, so I couldn't ask them if they were planning to put it on the net.
