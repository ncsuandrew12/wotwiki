#### Orbit

A number of fans have asked us why Mat did not appear in
*The Path of Daggers*
. Was this a conscious decision to delay his story until a more dramatic moment?

#### Robert Jordan

The man had a building fall on top of him. A building! Frankly, I didn't think Mat lying in bed in splints and bandages was very interesting.
