#### Orbit

Do you have any plans for what you might do after you finish the series? Will you take a break or dive straight into something new?

#### Robert Jordan

I'll take a very short break, just to relax a bit. At least, I intend to take a short break. It is very hard for me not to write. But I've been thinking about what I want to write next for about six years. Fantasy, but in a different world, with different cultures and customs. My editor, who I've told a little bit about what I'm thinking, believes it will be a chance for people to see inside the Seanchan empire in detail, though the place she is talking about isn't Seanchan or, as I said, anywhere at all in the world of The Wheel of Time. It will be about the clash of cultures, of course. And the clash between men and women. By the time I finish with The Wheel of Time, I should be about ready to start putting something on paper. I like to let these things swirl around in my head for a long time, first.
