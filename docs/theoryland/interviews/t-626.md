I've put up another
[Twitter archive](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/89/Tweets-September-19-October-8-2011)
post. And as I continue writing the first draft of
*A Memory of Light*
(now up to 75% of my 300,000-word projection), keep your eye on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Mistborn)
. Each time I come across a spot in the book where I need to insert a new name, I'll pick one from the
*A Memory of Light*
fundraiser drawing that's currently ongoing, and I'll announce whose name I picked. For more info see
[last week's post](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1021/)

There's a new
[*Mythwalker*](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/127/Warbreaker-Prime-Mythwalker-Chapter-Eight)
chapter up, which features a lot of Siri and Vvenna.
