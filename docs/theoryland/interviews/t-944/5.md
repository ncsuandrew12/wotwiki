Quick question if you're still about; Is this book [
*Steelheart*
] part of the Cosmere? Since it's based in Chicago I'm wondering if that maybe isn't the case?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, most of my "breather novels" are not Cosmere. The Cosmere requires meticulous planning and continuity. That's not usually good for what I'm looking to do when I take a break from a big project for a small one, though occasionally I can fit in a novella or such.

I don't suppose there's any way that we could read the prologue outside of a convention, is there? Or should I go surfing youtube for bootlegs?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I should do this. I'm on tour right now, though, so it's going to be tough—and I will probably have to coordinate with the publisher.

If you find a bootleg, let me know, and I'll tweet it for people. If it's already out there, I don't have to worry so much. If not, I'll see about doing something to get the prologue on line somewhere.

Brandon,

If you want to post it online somewhere, you know we're always happy to post this sort of thing...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks. I might do just that, but I have to coordinate with the publisher first.
