*The Way of Kings*
e-book is on sale for $2.99!

Sure wish this applied in the UK too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Huh. You know, I hadn't considered this. Tor, my US publisher, was the one who came to me and suggested the idea&mashso I said yes. And, stupidly, I didn't go to the UK publisher and suggest they do the same. I'll see what we can do.

#### [Ticus6](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aahne/the_way_of_kings_ebook_is_on_sale_for_299/c8w2tos )

Why did Tor want to do the sale? Is the second book close to being finished or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Second should be out later this year. (If I keep at it.)

#### [dowhatuwant2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aahne/the_way_of_kings_ebook_is_on_sale_for_299/c8vv9w5)

Would that apply for Australia too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It should. Email is sent. We'll see if we can prod UK/Ireland/Australia to match.

#### [Question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aahne/the_way_of_kings_ebook_is_on_sale_for_299/c8wo3yb)

Thank you for mentioning Ireland. Already have the hardcopy and wanted to get a copy for the kindle but despite having to use the US kindle store I couldn't get it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The email is off...but it might take some time to get a reply. The time difference sometimes means that having a conversation with the publisher in London has to occur across several days. Should know by early next week.

#### [dowhatuwant2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aahne/the_way_of_kings_ebook_is_on_sale_for_299/c8w0tk9)

Out of curiosity how big is the difference in terms of the amount you end up with in your pocket between retail price and sale price?

#### Brandon Sanderson

On ebooks with a traditional publisher, we get 17.5% of the sale price.

#### dowhatuwant2

What's the best method of purchasing a book/ebook in terms of most money in the author's pocket?

#### PeterAhlstrom

Hardcover puts the most money in the author's pocket per copy sold. And with Brandon's books, if they've been out for a year, you can get a signed one from his website and that puts way more money in his pocket. Though he would rather you just convince five of your friends to read the book, because that will pay off better over the long term.

#### dowhatuwant2

Thanks, getting signed books would be pretty great. Shipping cost to Australia is a bit high but that can't be helped.

#### PeterAhlstrom

Unfortunately, that is true, and it keeps getting more expensive. The US postal service won't even let you ship things by sea anymore; it's all airmail.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aahne/the_way_of_kings_ebook_is_on_sale_for_299/c8we2zc)

It's not something you should really worry about, honestly. Pick the format you enjoy the most, and go with that. They all have their value.

In my opinion, the best thing you can do for an author is loan your copy of the book out to a friend who hasn't ever read one of them. That's worth far more than the difference between formats.

However, since you asked, I should probably actually answer the question. I get about $4.25 off of a hardcover sale, about $.64 off of a paperback, and 17.5% from the paid price of any ebook. (So about $.52 for each one of these that sells during this promotion.) But again, that isn't something you should really have to worry about.
