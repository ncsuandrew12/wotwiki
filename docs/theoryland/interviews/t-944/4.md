Wait seriously? Is this actually Sanderson's reddit account or some guy doing the most long-term-troll ever?

#### tobyreddit

It's him, he's done an AMA before :)

#### BryGuyYup

Oh. Wow. Um. Cool.

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/168a5h/how_many_books_can_one_man_write_aka_a_new/c7u4bce)

I'm actually his half-formed clone, stuck in the basement with a computer, never allowed to see the light. help....me....

If I send you a bucket of fishheads, could you send me a autograph?

I'm sure hundreds of people have Sanderson's signature... but his half-formed clone? It'd be worth millions.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmm.... Fishheads. Brandon hates them, but WE loves them.

While you're here, I want you to know that you're the reason I finally got into Wheel of Time. Mistborn,
*Elantris*
... pretty much everything you've written, including some unpublished bits, have been my favorite fantasy books in a long, long time. I'd tried Wheel of Time but just couldn't get past the opening for the longest time. When I heard you were set to finish it I knew I had to try again, and after finally pushing through the introduction again I love it! I absolutely can't wait to get to your section of the story, even though it means I'll be closing the book (literally!) on what's quickly become another of my favorite epics.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Awesome! Thanks for that.
