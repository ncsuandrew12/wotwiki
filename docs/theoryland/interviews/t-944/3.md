[How many books can one man write? (AKA A new Brandon Sanderson book)](http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2013/01/cover-art-and-blurb-for-brandon.html)

I thought he was writing Stormlight 2? AMOL just came out, as did
*Legion*
and
*The Emperor's Soul*
(both novellas, I know). When did he write this? I wish I had half the work ethic that Mr. Sanderson does.

It's one of his 'breather projects' between/during the writing of larger works.

It's also one of the books that he started/wrote before he got involved in WoT.

Mes09 is right. This is one of the projects I was developing before I got involved with he WoT. I've actually been reading the prologue at conventions for years. I had to put the book aside in order to do the Wheel of Time. Now that I've finished, I had time to do revisions of this justice (Doing that was a breather project for me between AMOL and Stormlight 2.)

The odd thing is, I still feel kind of bad about not having a book come out last year, only short fiction. It's been almost three years now since
*The Way of Kings*
, still with no sequel.

I did need to get this book out of my system, though. It had been brewing for way too long. Fortunately, I had the majority of it done years ago.

Another book?? I cannot wait to delve into it. I started on your books with
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
. Then I picked up
*Emperor's Soul*
because the story looked intriguing and omg the cover art was so brilliant, and now am reading
*The Way of Kings*
. I have to say I became an instant fan, I cannot wait to read your other books. I love the way you portray your characters. I don't know if you will ever see this but thank you, your book, your writings they filled me with hope.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did see it. Thank you for reading, and for the kind words.
