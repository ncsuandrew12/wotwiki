# [Interview #944: Reddit 2013 (Non-WoT), Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=944#28)

Which book should be my next to read?

*Elantris*
and
*Rithmatist*
were my next two books on my list and I was going to read which ever I just got my hands on first. I ended up getting both of them in my hands right now, so I don't know what I should read first.

*Elantris*
is his first novel and many people really love it while
*Rithmatist*
is new and sounds really interesting.

What would you suggest reading next?

Also, if it makes a difference, I will be going to an event that he will be at over the weekend, so I want to be able to talk about more than just Mistborn.

Thanks for the help.

*Elantris*
was my first published book, and it does show. I think it's still perfectly readable, but do go into it knowing that it wanders in places, that the prose is a little rough, and the characters a little more straightforward than those of Mistborn. It would be a good one to read if you are interested in the Cosmere, as
*The Rithmatist*
isn't a Cosmere book.

*The Rithmatist*
is a stronger work overall, but has a weaker start. (That's the roughest part of the book.) It is also more narrow—it has one viewpoint character, and is about basically one event. It's going to read faster than
*Elantris*
, come together more tightly, but overall is going to feel less deep because of its focused nature.

Either way, thanks for reading.
