What have you guys been up to? Any sales or signings or agents news or finished manuscripts or other good stuff you want to share?

This is the promo page: post whatever new stuff you have for this month here!

I...kind of have the country's #1 bestselling YA book this week. Does that count?

EDIT:
[Link, by request, to the

bestseller list](http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html)
. I am #1 on the YA list, which you have to scroll WAY down to find.

Sure does! Link that shizz up!

Also: congrats!

Also also: my husband ADORES your work. He's incredibly stompy right now that I won't let him buy

, but it's only because I've already gotten him a copy for Christmas. Fortunately, he never ever reads this sub.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Link posted. Thanks! It's my first time at #1 on the teen list, so we were quite excited.

#### bethrevis

That is truly awesome and amazing! You have every reason to be excited!

#### Lilah\_Rose

If that wasn't impressive enough, I've just realized you've been on reddit for 5 years!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. I've wasted my fair share of time around here. :)

#### chihuahuazero

Hello! I haven't read any of your stuff yet, but I might check your books out now.

Do you hang around here much?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've been impressed with the sub. It seems well managed and genuinely helpful. I don't post much for time reasons, but I do read much of what gets posted here.
