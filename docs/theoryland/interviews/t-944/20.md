I might not prefer your stuff, sir, but you are a class act all the way.

Just curious, what don't you like about it?

#### CargoCulture

Pacing and tone, mostly. But it's a minor quibble. Mr. Sanderson is a great writer, just not one I tend to enjoy reading.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thumbs up from me, CargoCulture. There are plenty of fantastic writers I could name who just...well, don't click with me. There's nothing at all wrong with that. In fact, I really wish more people were like you—capable of simply not liking something, rather than making an issue of it.
