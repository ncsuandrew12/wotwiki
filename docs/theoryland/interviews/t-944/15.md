Well I received my first rejection letter and feeling a little depressed. How do others deal with a letter like this?

This touched me, so I just went [and] dug something out just for you.

These are pretty special in that they're from over ten years ago, and are rejections of
*Elantris*
and
*Dragonsteel*
, the first two books in my cosmere cycle. After getting the second of those rejections, I was pretty down in the dumps. Things turned a corner for me soon after.

Head up. Keep writing.
