You people. (And I say that with fondness.)

Yes, I'd probably do it—so long as it didn't become a thing. Someone asking for a fun, odd signature once in a while is doable. But if people started asking for a page of writing each time they ordered a book, I'd have to stop offering personalizations.

At least it's better than the guy/gal who always asks for a limerick...

#### Darkenmal

Wow, neat! Thanks for coming in here and being awesome.

Haha, i was planning on doing this for the Wheel of Time books. Something like "I solemnly swear not to use the words 'Homicide, Guano, and Lichen' in
*A Memory of Light*
" but I was broke. :( Luckily it was unneeded. Thanks again for finishing the series!

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was an honor.

At least I didn't find a place for Maladroit or Inchoate. (I think.) Those are ones I tend to find too many excuses to use...
