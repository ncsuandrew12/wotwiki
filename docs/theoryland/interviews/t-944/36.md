Sorry. I'm doing a lot of blog posts—it's release week and all that. While I'm happy to see people posting them here, I don't particularly want to dominate the front page and annoy people.

I guess it's like what happens at a gaming subreddit when a new game comes out. If it's any consolation, this should taper off next week.
