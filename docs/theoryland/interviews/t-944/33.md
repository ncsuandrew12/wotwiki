[This is interesting—thrift store find of an advance copy Sanderson...](http://i.imgur.com/Om8uvFl.jpg)

#### Maldevinine

I've seen thrift store advance reader copies before. Fun to have in the collection.

Are you interested enough to read the whole thing and tell us what changed between the advance and the mass market copy?

If you really want to know this sort of thing, I posted one of my novels (
*Warbreaker*
) on my website in each of its incarnations. You can compare the last draft version with the printed version. In fact, you can just plug them both into Microsoft Word and have it "Compare documents" and it will highlight any changes.

I think it's great that you respond to this sort of post—thanks for that—it really makes me happy to be around in this day and age where the authors really interact with their fan base.

EDIT: question—on the back of the book it says "9-copy floor display (November 2011; $224.91)". What does that mean? Does that mean 9 copies of the first edition hard cover and a floor display for that amount? Just wondering.

Thanks!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow! Slow to getting back to you, aren't I? Sorry about that.

This means that if a store wants one of those nifty floor displays that they put in bookstore sometimes, they can buy one from the publisher. The prince there is the retail prince, I believe. They'd actually buy it wholesale, for about half the cost listed. (Though I don't know a ton about the marketing side, so I could be wrong.)

The Retail Prince, noblest of all retailers.
