[Brandon Sanderson announces
*Infinity Blade: Redemption*](http://brandonsanderson.com/infinity-blade-redemption-pre-order-starts-today/)

I wonder which of the BSBs (Brandon Sanderson Bots) wrote this one? I'd guess it was BSB\_04, since I'm pretty sure the current situation is:

BSB\_01 is focused on
*Words Of Radiance*
  
BSB\_02 is working on
*Firefight*
(
*Steelheart*
sequel)
  
BSB\_03 is prepping the
*Rithmatist*
sequel
  
BSB\_04 is prepping
*Shadows of Self*
(next Mistborn)
  
BSB\_05 is handling the promotional events
  
BSB\_06 handles the Writing Excuses stuff
  
BSB\_07 does M:TG/fathering

Seriously, how the hell does he do all of this?!

You forgot BSB-8: The Reddit bot.

Actually, this was my breather short piece between
*Words of Radiance*
(rough draft) and diving into
*Firefight*
and the WoR 2nd draft. I'm really feeling like I could use a few more bots, these days. The promotional events side of things has been killer.

I do have to say that these two
*Infinity Blade*
shorts have been quite fun to do. They've been my first chance to dive into something video game related, which is another entire world of writing. I plan to write the Mistborn video game when we finally get around to doing the thing, and getting some first-hand experience with the backend of video gaming has been wonderful.

So much awesomeness at once. Please don't burn out though! We want you to keep making books in the years to come too.

Also, we'll keep bying your books, so you don't need all that promoting ;)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, promotion for someone like me is more about going out and saying "Thank you" than it is about going out to encourage people to buy my books. Most of that promotion involves doing booksignings or conventions, which I do explicitly to meet with readers. (Without whom, I'd never have been able to do what I've done.)

The problem comes in saying yes to a full slate of conventions, then having two publishers decide to release three of my books this year. (When I had no book releases last year.) That added a heap of publicity onto my slate. Next year should go back to a more normal schedule.

#### Jimmith

Well, I can't pretend to be sorry for getting several books out of you this year, but it does sound like a monumental task.

Some of us really appreciate you interacting with your fans here, so thank you. That being said, I really prefer reading works that came completely from your own imagination than that of someone else.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kqkmd/brandon_sanderson_announces_infinity_blade/cbrtj7d)

I understand this, and don't worry—I don't plan to do a lot of this. At the same time, working within confines like these offer me a chance to flex different kinds of writing muscles, ones which I'd like to practice using. I plan to take these kinds of projects sparingly. However, if I'm going to dabble in video games, I figure I should gain some experience with the medium before I tackle something like Mistborn.

#### [Slug\_Laton\_Rocking](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kqkmd/brandon_sanderson_announces_infinity_blade/cbrto7x)

Are you tempted to write some content for an RPG like Patrick Rothfuss is doing for Torment? Love the books by the way.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The thing that would most tempt me would be doing Magic: The Gathering content, as that is my nerd obsession. I could foresee doing some kind of RPG content, however. Depends on the project and how behind on things I'm feeling.

#### Slug\_Laton\_Rocking

Ha my respect for you just went up a notch. Nothing more fun then playing Magic: The Gathering with a big group of friends.

#### [savramescu](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kqkmd/brandon_sanderson_announces_infinity_blade/cbrv0ho)

To be honest there must be versions BSB-9 and BSB-10 because you're also in those writing lectures on youtube.

I'm loving them by the way. At the start of the last years session where you started asking if anyone read
*Honor Harrington*
I literally raised my hand in front of the screen (couldn't believe more people didn't). You should assign it as a mandatory reading!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Glad you're enjoying them. Keep writing.
