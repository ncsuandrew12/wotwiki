TOR.com International release?

I was wondering if anyone here knows how to purchase
*The Way of Kings*
in Australia? Brandon's website says it's $3 and DRM free but none of the links seem to work over here. Any thoughts?

My UK publisher has the right to distribute there, so you should be able to buy it on Amazon.co.uk. However, despite our request, I don't believe that they've decided to discount the ebook to match Tor's promotion. (I might be wrong; perhaps they've lowered the price.)

I'm sorry about this. A lot of things are more expensive down under because of shipping; ebooks shouldn't be one of them.
