Man. Is this what it feels like to have finally made it? I feel like Weird Al just did a cover of one of my songs.

Honestly, I probably am.

It's pretty awesome to appear in a Penny Arcade strip, either way. And, to be honest, a major shock. I still haven't gotten over the surprise that comes from having random websites I visit suddenly mentioning me.

Next thing you know, Yahtzee will be comparing me to someone's testicles.
