[Mitosis: A Reckoners Story](http://books.google.com/books?id=QMAaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT18&lpg=PT18&dq=mitosis+a+reckoners+story&source=bl&ots=V1QjM1PB_F&sig=GvXw-HOhIb_yfJu-oknQJJbLV84&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qG-VUtiHOKThyQHQ4YDwDg&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=mitosis%20a%20reckoners%20story&f=false)

Does anyone know if this book will take place between the first and second Steelheart book? Or will this just be the beginning of the second one as kind of a teaser?

Between first and second. Stand-alone story. Including some really bad power ballad lyrics by yours truly.
