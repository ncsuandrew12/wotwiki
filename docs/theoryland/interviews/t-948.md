## [Entry #1](./t-948/1)

#### Mason Wheeler

I was there too [the Seattle signing], and I asked a few Cosmere questions. I didn't record any of this, and what I'm reporting here, both in my questions and his answers, (particularly his answer to the first question) are kind of paraphrased, but this is accurate enough. (Note: Mistborn and
*Way of Kings*
spoilers ahead.)

## [Entry #2](./t-948/2)

#### Mason Wheeler

You've said that Splintering a shard is essentially the same thing as the shattering of Adonalsium, repeated on a smaller scale.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Mason Wheeler

And a while ago, someone asked you if Splintering was permanent or reversible, and you said that it can be reversed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Mason Wheeler

And shard holders tend to take the name of the shard they hold. So you've got Sazed, who goes by "Harmony" now, after taking up Ruin and Preservation. That makes me wonder, does he hold two shards... or one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You could really answer that either way. The distinction is a really subjective one, and you could say that he's holding both shards, or that he holds one single Harmony.

## [Entry #3](./t-948/3)

#### Mason Wheeler

So, according to King Taravangian, the... erm... I don't actually know the name for it, the uh, death-babbling phenomenon...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Death rattles.

#### Mason Wheeler

OK, death rattles have been going on since about the time the Parshendi were first discovered. Soon after this, King Gavilar was killed, and he said something that sounds kind of nonsensical. Was that him talking, or someone else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that was Gavilar.

## [Entry #4](./t-948/4)

#### Mason Wheeler

All right. And related to that, sometimes some little concepts kind of... cross worlds. When Miles [from
*The Alloy of Law*
] died, who was talking there? Him, or someone else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, that's a really excellent question. And I'm afraid I'm going to have to RAFO that.

#### Mason Wheeler

Aww... figures.

## [Entry #5](./t-948/5)

#### Mason Wheeler

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Also, I overheard him saying to anther fan that all magic on Sel is essentially programming, and building up a complex Aonic effect or an intricate Forgery works just like writing code.

#### Mason Wheeler

(As a computer programmer myself, I found that pretty cool.)
