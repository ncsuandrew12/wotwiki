Why were the trees at the palace in Azir bronze? Soulcast?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Soulcast for decoration.

## [Entry #2](./t-1172/2)

#### Question

Does Lift’s shadow behave abnormally with respect to the sun or infused spheres?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there is something going on with her shadow, but no specifics given.

## [Entry #3](./t-1172/3)

#### Gary Singer

Could Lift convert food from other Cosmere worlds into Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Lift’s spiritweb has something changed about it to allow converting mass to Investiture directly.

#### Footnote

Based on Brandon’s answer, I'm not even sure she has to metabolize the food. It could be that she can burn anything she can swallow.

## [Entry #4](./t-1172/4)

#### Mark Lindberg

Would emotion spren react in any way if a Rioter or Soother were operating in the area?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, you would be able to see that sort of change if you were paying attention.
