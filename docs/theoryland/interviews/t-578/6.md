# [Interview #578, Entry #6]: New Zealand Herald Interview with Brandon Sanderson: From chasing the market to living his fantasy](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=578#6)

#### David Larsen

Jordan had been the big fantasy sensation of the 90s. His mega-series The Wheel Of Time began as a five-book cycle, then was expanded to a projected 12 books on the back of massive sales and critical acclaim. Each individual book was vast. The gaps between books slowly got longer and longer as Jordan struggled with gargantuan plot machinery, a cast of thousands and failing health.

He died in 2007, still working on the final volume, and McDougal, having been impressed by the
*Mistborn*
books, phoned Sanderson and asked whether he would be interested in finishing off the series from Jordan's notes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"She called me out of the blue and, dumbfounded, I said yes. I mean I was a huge fan of Robert Jordan, how could I not say yes? But I was terrified. And I rightly should have been."

#### David Larsen

Sanderson has spent much of the last three years on the Jordan project, which has involved splitting an unworkably huge manuscript—Jordan made extremely detailed notes, fortunately for worried fans of the series—into three parts, each of which will become a 300,000-word novel. The second of these is due out in New Zealand this month.
