# [Interview #749, Entry #22]: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#22)

#### Luckers

Okay, so, there have been three incidences where characters have ignored the Choedan Kal in favour of
*Callandor*
—or well, not even that. Just ignored the Choedan Kal. Shaidar Haran in
*The Gathering Storm*
when Elza took the Domination Band, Solinda during Rand’s flashbacks was the one who gave the
*ter’angreal*
to the Aiel, but made no efforts to secure the Choedan Kal like
*Callandor*
, and the Aes Sedai who was looking to fight Ishamael during the breaking who took
*sa’angreal*
from the Aiel, but left the Choedan Kal. So I guess the question is...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why are they choosing
*Callandor*
over the Choedan Kal?

#### LUCKERS

Well, not even that, really, because two of those have nothing to do with the
*Callandor*
. I guess it’s more, was there something dodgy... did they know something about the Choedan Kal... why did they leave it?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

There is a reason. It has to do with
*Callandor*
being key to the ending, and the Choedan Kal not.
