# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#20)

#### Luckers

In
*The Great Hunt*
Ishamael has no knowledge that Mat sounded the Horn, and thinks Rand did. Later on though, a Fade refers to Mat as the Hornsounder. How did he know?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### LUCKERS

\*we talked about this for a while, and I didnâ€™t take any notes on that part of the conversation (so it was nothing big) we dropped back into interesting stuff a bit later and I resumed note taking\*

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I will say that, in the course of writing
*A Memory of Light*
, I learned some very interesting things that went against some strong preconceptions I had about the Horn. Some of the ideas I had, about how it worked, turned out to be incorrect.
