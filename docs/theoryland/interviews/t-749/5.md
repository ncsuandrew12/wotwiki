# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#5)

#### Luckers

Do the Seanchan know of
*angreal*
? Can a
*damane*
use one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They know of
*angreal*
. That’s in the notes. And yes, as far as I know a
*damane*
should be able to use one. I mean
*damane*
are essentially in links, and women in links can still use
*angreal*
, but this is a good question, because, it’s odd then that we haven’t seen them use them.

#### LUCKERS

Maybe they were thought too valuable to risk in an invasion—though that’s odd, because that would be sort of where they are needed most.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, I’m not sure... that is strange. But they definitely know of
*angreal*
.
