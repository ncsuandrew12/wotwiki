Was the Shiny Dragon... was
[she](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=537#3)
manipulating Masema before Perrin met him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Umm, when did Perrin meet Masema? Was it in the scene where Alliandre is kneeling and giving her jewelery to him?

#### LUCKERS

No, that was...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Nynaeve, yeah. Right.

#### LUCKERS

Perrin met him at the same time Faile was getting kidnapped.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Right. Then in that case, yes, the Shiny Dragon was manipulating him before.

#### Footnote

Technically Perrin met Masema in Fal Dara, and spent a fair amount of time with him on the way to Falme, and afterward.
