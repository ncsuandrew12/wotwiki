# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#18)

#### Luckers

Can someone who is leashed by an
*a'dam*
touch
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*blinks at me\* Umm. That's a really good question.

#### Luckers

I ask, because it's odd that Moghedien never tried to use the dream to escape, or to capture someone in Salidar and compel her to free Moghedien in the waking world, or anything like that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that's a good question. I'd guess no, but you can MAFO that.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/answers-to-a-few-mafo-questions-r658)

I believe that you cannot touch
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
while leashed, but I can't find anything in the notes that states so outright.

#### Footnote

When Brandon was first asked this question in 2010, he
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=543#1)
"90% yes". In 2013 (after Luckers' 2012 interview), he
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=935#5)
it was "not outside the realm of possibility". Maria answered the question later in 2013.
