# [Interview #749, Entry #28]: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#28)

#### Luckers

What was the stylized raven that Min viewed around Carlinya?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I thought that had already been answered. Did Jim not answer this?

#### Luckers

No. Everyone thought it referred to Carlinya being
*da’covale*
to the Empress. But no, it hasn’t been answered.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh. Oh, okay. Well, I will RAFO/MAFO it. You can email Maria and me about it, but I may have to RAFO it.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/answers-to-a-few-mafo-questions-r658)

The raven is a symbol of the Dark One as well as the Seanchan; Carlinya was killed fighting the Black Ajah.

#### Footnote

The reason why fans thought it was surely in reference to the Seanchan is because Min thought it looked like a tattoo. (See
*The Fires of Heaven*
Chapter 26.)
