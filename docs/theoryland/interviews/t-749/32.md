# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#32)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When we were discussing Moiraine’s various
*angreal*
, Brandon said he was of the impression that even with it, Moiraine’s was still very close, but just shy of her original strength. I checked that night and Moiraine does say in
*Towers of Midnight*
that with it she is 'very strong, stronger than I was before'. I checked with Brandon and he nodded and said that that was a scene that RJ wrote, and it went in almost without any changes. I started to ask whether he was still under the impression that Moiraine was close to her old strength, albeit on the upwards side (after all to an Aes Sedai Moiraine’s old strength was ‘very strong’, and therefore Moiraine might only be marginally stronger, and she might very well phrase it precisely as she did). A fan approached at that moment, and I’m not sure how much of the question Brandon heard, and we never got a chance to raise it again, so it might be worth clarifying.

#### Footnote

Brandon went into a little more detail
[here](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=722#8)
on the changes he had to make for that scene.
