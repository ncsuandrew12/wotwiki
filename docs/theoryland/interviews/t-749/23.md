# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#23)

#### Luckers

Okay, so the warding on the Great Holding in Tear... it’s just, Moiraine, Mat, Rand, the Wonder Girls, all come and go with ease, yet Mesaana speaks of there being a nasty warding that stopped her getting in, and there is no sign that Be’lal... I mean, why wouldn’t Be’lal have taken the fat man
*angreal*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*nodding before I finished\* MAFO. That was something I was going to look into myself, because it stumped me during my last re-read. I never got round to it... you haven’t seen the size of the pile of notes, they are huge, and most of my time... I have to give over to things that are involved in what I’m working on. Sometimes though, I do just go into them purely for fan interest.

#### Luckers

I would love to have an afternoon alone with the notes. \*another fan nods fervently\*

It is my understanding that Rand put that warding on when he was getting ready to leave Tear. As for Be’lal . . . well, he was one of the Chosen; what need had he of an
*angreal*
to go up against an untrained sheepherder? That’s my best guess, anyway.
