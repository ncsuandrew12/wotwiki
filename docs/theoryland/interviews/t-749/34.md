# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#34)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon again spoke of Aviendha and the Aiel, due to the way they think, mentioning how he went through several drafts and back and forths with Harriet, whilst doing multiple re-reads of Aviendha’s POVs.

Then he spoke of Mat, saying that Mat is such a complicated character, though you might not think he is at first glance. He is an unreliable narrator, with vast differences between how he thinks and how he acts, and that Jim’s Mat POV’s are some of the best in the series. He then spoke of his own writing and that because of these elements it’s easy to miss things with Mat, and that that is why his early scenes in
*The Gathering Storm*
are not as good as his scenes in
*Towers of Midnight*
, where Brandon began to ‘get him’. Brandon finished by saying he’s best in
*A Memory of Light*
.
