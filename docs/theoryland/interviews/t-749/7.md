#### Luckers

What does
*amahn'rukane*
mean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*stares at me blankly for a long moment\* What... um... what has been said on it before?

#### LUCKERS

Just that it’s a sword sticking out of the earth. Cadsuane names it...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Oh right, umm. I don’t know. \*he laughs\* You can probably tell something about it from that.

#### LUCKERS

That it’s not important.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

\*laughs again\*.
