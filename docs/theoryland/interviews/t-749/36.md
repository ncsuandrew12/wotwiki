# [Interview #749, Entry #36]: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#36)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon spoke of how sometimes the characters he liked did get more air time, and that this was a side effect of having a fan write the books. He spoke of his love of Perrin, and how he wanted
*Towers of Midnight*
to be a 'big, awesome, Perrin book', and that that is what he hoped he delivered.
