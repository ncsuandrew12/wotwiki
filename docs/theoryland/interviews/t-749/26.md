# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#26)

#### Luckers

Why did Aran’gar not kill Chesa?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Chesa?

#### LUCKERS

Egwene’s maid. Aran’gar killed the others, but not Chesa.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Right. RAFO, and I... when I RAFO, I do it with things that might have significance.

#### LUCKERS

I was being a bit sneaky. There was this theory that Chesa might be a Darkfriend—brought in by Sheriam, left along by Aran’gar.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

\*poker face\* RAFO.
