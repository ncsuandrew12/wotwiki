# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#14)

#### Luckers

Do the Forsaken know the weaves Elza used to break the warding Cadsuane placed on the Domination Band?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### LUCKERS

So, why didn’t they use it on wardings Rand placed on
*Callandor*
, and the other things they’ve wanted that were warded earlier in the series?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

\*stares at me for a long moment, thoughtfully\* They may not have know them then. The thing is... we don’t see a lot of the Shadow innovating with the Power, unlike with the Light, but they have been. As much as the Light. But they know, now. The notes definitely say this.
