# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#31)

#### Luckers

These are bits and pieces that we discussed or I overheard during the course of the weekend, but which I didnâ€™t keep shorthand notes on, and therefore cannot reliably reconstruct our conversations, and there is the greatest chance here, I think, for me to have misquoted something, so take all this with a grain of salt.
