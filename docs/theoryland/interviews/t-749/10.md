# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#10)

#### Luckers

Are the major characters all at their full strength now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### LUCKERS

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, Elayne might not... I think she is, but she may not quite be there.
