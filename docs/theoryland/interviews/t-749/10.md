# [Interview #749, Entry #10]: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#10)

#### Luckers

Are the major characters all at their full strength now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### LUCKERS

I just ask because, like Nynaeve has been channeling longer, and Egwene was forced. And Rand likely was too, and as a man gains strength more swiftly...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, Elayne might not... I think she is, but she may not quite be there.
