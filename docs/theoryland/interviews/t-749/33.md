# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#33)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When we were in the Green Room Brandon broached a subject of his own, in Asmodean, stating he wanted to explain how that happened. Basically, Jim left a note saying ‘fit it in’, and when they were initially discussing how to do it Brandon threw out as more of a joke than anything else ‘just put it in the glossary’. Harriet apparently loved that idea, and when it came time for Brandon to write, he did lay it out in a Graendal POV [note: I can’t remember if he said it was in an outline for a POV, or whether he actually wrote it] Harriet wrote back in her notes ‘no, no, we’re going to put that in the glossary.’ Brandon himself definitely seemed to have wanted the information laid out in scene, and said there were actually a couple of scenes he thought he could have done it in.

#### LUCKERS

They still argue about it anyway, you know.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

\*laughs\* Yeah, well, you know Jim himself never wrote it out. There was just that email a fan had sent him, you know the...

#### LUCKERS

The
[Sherlock Holmes](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4975913/1/Sherlock_Holmes_Examines_the_Death_of_Asmodean)
one?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, just that with a note saying 'this is it'. Everything else...

#### LUCKERS

Hah. Yeah, I never really cared about Asmodean.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Me either, really. Until I went on the boards, and everyone was discussing it.

#### LUCKERS

Yeah, now they have the debate about whether Tam and Cadsuane are going to get married.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

\*shudders\* Yeah, I’ve... ah... heard that one.
