# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#8)

#### Luckers

So, there are two different types of Darkhounds. Ones that can be killed with a sword, and ones that take balefire, and I was wondering if the difference was that the ones who can be killed with a sword are the ones that are turned by a Darkhound bite, whilst the balefire ones are those changed using the original method to make Darkhounds.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is an awesome theory. No. But I am very glad you came up with it—it fits very neatly with how Sanderson would have done it. But still, no.

#### LUCKERS

Can you tell me the actual cause for the difference?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Haha, no. RAFO.

#### LUCKERS

Can you tell me what the
*Crossroads of Twilight*
superpack are hunting?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Ummm. No, I still might... it still might be in the books. So RAFO. But if it’s not in the books then it’s open for you all to ask again after
*A Memory of Light*
. But for now, RAFO.
