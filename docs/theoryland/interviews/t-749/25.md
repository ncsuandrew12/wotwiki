# [Interview #749, Entry #25]: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#25)

#### Luckers

Sammael claims to have a truce with Rand, even though we see Rand turn him down. Was Sammael lying, or did...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m fairly sure he was lying. As in, I’ve seen something in the notes at one point, and I’m pretty sure it was... but my memory being what it is, I will say you can MAFO that. But I’m pretty sure he was lying.

Sammael was lying in an attempt to manipulate Graendal.
