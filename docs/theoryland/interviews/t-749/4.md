# [Interview #749: Afternoon Tea with Brandon Sanderson - Luckers, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#4)

#### Luckers

Verin infers that Tomas had to die within an hour of their betrayal of the Dark One, which is odd because he didn’t have that requirement, and she could have released him from the bond, so I was wondering, was Verin playing here?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What you have to understand is Tomas was tired of this world. Without Verin, he didn’t really want to be around...

#### LUCKERS

So Tomas is dead?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes. Tomas is dead. She could have released him, yes, but he didn’t want that.
