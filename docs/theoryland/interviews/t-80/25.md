#### Ayla Sedai from the White Tower

I am in two online guilds based on the Wheel of Time series, but I heard you have officially approved one. I have also heard you approved no guilds. Which guild, if any did you approve? (And why did you let Darrell Sweet do your book coversâ€”the Armylin wants to know.)

#### Robert Jordan

I have approved several fan clubs who wrote to me and asked me to endorse them. I don't approve anybody exclusively. As far as Darrell goes, he was selected by the publisher.
