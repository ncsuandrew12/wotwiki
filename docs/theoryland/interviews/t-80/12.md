Do you have any short stories? I love your novels and am wondering if you have any short story collections out?

I've never done a short story except that I am at the moment working on one which will be in a collection called
*Masters of Fantasy*
, which Robert Silverberg has put together. Actually I'm not certain it really counts as a short storyâ€”more of a novella.
