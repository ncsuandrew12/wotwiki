#### Josette from Pittsburgh, PA

Was it your idea for the Robert Jordan hotline? I think that's such a great idea.

#### Robert Jordan

The hotline at Tor was my idea. And you reminded meâ€”I have to record a new message. It's been a while since I've recorded one. A lot of what's on that is outdated now, I'm afraid. That is if you mean the message that I've recorded at Tor Books.
