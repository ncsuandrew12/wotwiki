#### Jonathon from Nebraska

Mr. Jordan...I play a one of the best telnet games based on your books (cshadow.net port 4000). It runs as close to you books as we can get. My question is this...I play a Seanchan character and have for some time. What was your basis when creating the Seanchan race and the structure of their society? I enjoy the race completely and love the structure of its hierarchy and was just curious as to what they are created from in your mind...? Thank you!!

#### Robert Jordan

Imperial China. Japan during the Shogunites, with strong dollups from the Persian Empire and from the Ottoman.
