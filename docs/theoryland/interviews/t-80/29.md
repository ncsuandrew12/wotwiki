#### Nansen from Ithaca, NY

Hi, just curious. In the last section of
*The Eye of the World*
, Lan says that the bond does not tell him the direction where his Aes Sedai is exactly; it is just a general feeling. But then later in the series, both he and Rand had the ability to tell an exactly straight line direction the location of whom they are bonded to. Is this an inconsistency or is there an explanation? Thanks!

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. There is an explanation. A change that was supposed to be made in manuscript in
*The Eye of the World*
and did not get set into type and which [has not] been corrected. I have been trying to get that changed every since I discovered that
*The Eye of the World*
has been published with the erroneous information. I hope they are still not printing the books with it.
