#### Rhonda Peters from Toronto, Ontario

Would you be willing to tell us a little more about the limits of Healing with the One Power, as they're understood in the present day and/or the Age of Legends? Could someone Heal a genetic condition like Huntington's or color blindness? A chromosomal defect like Down's Syndrome? A degenerative condition like arthritis?

#### Robert Jordan

Not with the form of Healing that in generally known. With the newly rediscovered forms of Healing, it would be quite possible, but with the newly rediscovered forms of Healing people would (need to) learn how to do it because everything is Healed differently with the new way.
