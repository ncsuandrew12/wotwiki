#### Joar from Costa Mesa, CA

You have mentioned that you intentionally tried to recreate some of the feel of Tolkien's Middle Earth, especially in the first book. Considering many of the similar elements between the stories and the fact that time in your world is cyclical, with heroes being reborn through the ages, did you intend to imply that Middle Earth could possibly be "an Age long past, an Age yet to come"?

#### Robert Jordan

Certainly not. In the first hundred pages of
*The Eye of the World*
I did try to invoke a Tolkienesque feel. But after that I have certainly not tried to reflect in any way Middle Earth. As a matter of fact, beginning back in that very early part of
*The Eye of the World*
, I deliberately took off in a very different direction from Tolkien and I've been running hard in that direction ever since.
