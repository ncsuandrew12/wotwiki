# [Interview #80: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=80#9)

#### JRS Caudill from Minneapolis

Mr. Jordan, I believe you have stated in past interviews that you already have an idea for your next project. I wonder, have you begun to work on it yet? And, will you work on both series simultaneously or will you complete the WOT series first? Also, is there any source currently available for us to see your work written under the pseudonym of Chang Lung? Thank you.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes I have an idea for what I intend to write after I finish the Wheel of Time, but I have not put anything down on paper. And I will not until I have finished the Wheel of Time. Until then, the next work exists only in the back of my head. As far as Chang Lung, I don't think there is any source anywhere except for my files and I'd just as soon leave them there. There are few things more boring than ten-year-old dance reviews and theater criticism.
