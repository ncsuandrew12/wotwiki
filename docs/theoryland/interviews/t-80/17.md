#### Matt from New York

I love your Reagan O'Neal historical novels, the Fallon series. Did you have to do a lot of research for those?

#### Robert Jordan

A good bit. But on the other hand history is a hobby of mine, in particular the American Revolution in the South and the Southern move west, which went through Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California.
