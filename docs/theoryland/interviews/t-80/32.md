#### Rudi Nuissl from Colorado

When you first started writing, what was your first effort and how long was it before you had anything published?

#### Robert Jordan

My first book was accepted by DAW and then rejected by DAW 20 years ago. Whereupon I immediately resigned my position as an engineer. The first year I made nothing, the second year I made 3000 dollars and the third year I made twice what I had made my best years as an engineer. I have been earning my living with my pen ever since.
