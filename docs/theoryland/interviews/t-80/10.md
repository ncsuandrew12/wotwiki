# [Interview #80: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=80#10)

#### Kate from State College, PA

In a previous statement I believe you had basically said that the action of the series would take place in the lands known to Rand and his friends, i.e., not Shara or Seanchan and yet the new book has a lot of stuff about those landsâ€”have you changed your mind? Is action in either of these two lands a possibility now?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Except for the possible occasional divergence, except for Rand's excursions to Seanchan when he chased after Aviendha. I was willing to put as much as I did into the the guide because I will not be using those things in the books in the same way that I used Kandor or Saldaea.
