#### Robert from Nebraska

Robert, I'd love to meet you sometime. I love your books with a passion and think you are an incredible writer. Do you ever go to conventions or have any plans on touring to promote your next book?

#### Robert Jordan

I believe my publisher intends for me to tour for
*The Path of Daggers*
. But I have no idea which cities will be included. As far as conventions go, I attend far fewer than I would like to because three days at a con are three days I'm not writing.
