#### Terry Miles

Is there any new information in the new book that has not already been presented in the existing books?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. There's almost nothing that is in the new book that is in the other books. There are things that are mentioned in the books and greatly expanded and they contain a great deal of information that is nowhere in the novels.
