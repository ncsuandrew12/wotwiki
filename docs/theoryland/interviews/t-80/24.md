#### Mike from Boston

When you create a character, how much do you know about them? Do they ever go off in directions you hadn't expected?

#### Robert Jordan

When I create a character I know as much as possible about themâ€”as much as I can possibly conceive. Characters do not go in directions that I don't expect, because I am the writer, after all. Sometimes I will see a possibility that I didn't expect to use a character in a different way and I do like to do that, especially if it's something I don't think people will expect.
