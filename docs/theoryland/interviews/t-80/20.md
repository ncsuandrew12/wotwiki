#### Joel from Phoenix, AZ

Is there a complete language of the Old Tongue, and if so how long did it take you to develop it?

#### Robert Jordan

There are basic 880 some words—maybe 900. I got a list of what is considered basic English—which are the 800 odd words of a basic English vocabulary. Removed the words that were of no use in the context of my world. Came up with words in the Old Tongue in each of those English words and then added those words that did have a specific context in my world.
