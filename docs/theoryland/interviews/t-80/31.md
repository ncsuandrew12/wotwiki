#### John from State College, PA

The Guide has a lot of stuff we have not seen before. But there are a lot of references made in the series that had no mention in the Guide. As you have totally captivated me with your world, can I hope for another guide at the end of the series for more information on all those trivial bits we have come to love?

#### Robert Jordan

I do intend to do an encyclopedia, if you will, at the end of the series, but I don't want to do too much about what is in the books until the series is finished.
