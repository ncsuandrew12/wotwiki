#### Sisay from Frostburg, MD

Rumor has it that you read 400+ books a year. Is this true? What kind of books do you read? Any recommendations (besides re-reading WoT!!) while we're waiting for
*The Path of Daggers*
?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't manage to read over 400 books a year now. I'm not certain that I even managed to average a book a day. About half of what I read is nonfiction, half fiction. And the fiction takes in everything. As for recommendations, I assume you mean in the field, so try John M. Ford, C.S. Friedman, Guy Gavriel Kay, Terry Pratchett, George R. Martin and a slew of othersâ€”too many to name. You can find them.
