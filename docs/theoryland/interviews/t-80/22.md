#### Sam from Sacramento

When it says at the end of
*The Fires of Heaven*
"death took him," in Asmodean's last scene, do you mean that he died? There has been much speculation as to whether or not "death" refers to Moridin, whose name in the Old Tongue means "death." Many think that Moridin's second Mindtrap is for Asmodean, but "death" was not capitalized in the scene where Asmodean made his last appearance. Can you tell me whether or not he was taken by Moridin?

#### Robert Jordan

Asmodean went for the long jump in that scene.
