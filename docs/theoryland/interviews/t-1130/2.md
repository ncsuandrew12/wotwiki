#### Ruro272

Any hint on how Nin got a hold of Nightblood, or how Vasher lost Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Vasher and Nightblood had something of a falling out..."

#### Footnote

This is a direct quote since it is written in my book. Not all that interesting, but I think the important implication here is that Nightblood was not "stolen" without Vasher's knowledge, they had a "falling out". Obviously this doesn't answer a lot but I think it does put to rest the possibility that somebody came up and stole Nightblood out of nowhere. From other WoB we know that Vasher "misses and feels responsible for Nightblood" so obviously he's gotten over it since then.
