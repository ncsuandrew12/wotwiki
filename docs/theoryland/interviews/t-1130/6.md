#### Ruro272

On a similar note, since Elsecallers can physically go to Shadesmar and have access to Transportation surge, can all Elsecallers worldhop?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that is one of the Elsecaller powers.

#### Footnote

The most interesting thing about this is that, depending on the number of people in the Elsecaller order, there may have been quite a few Worldhoppers from Roshar throughout history. i'm surprised they weren't more Cosmere-aware if that was the case, but maybe they always just stuck around Roshar? I wonder how many Elsecallers are on other planets....
