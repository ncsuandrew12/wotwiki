Will we see all of the Heralds doing things in the upcoming books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The back five books are all about the Heralds. Two of them claim to be Heralds..... Two of the point-of-views will be Heralds.

#### Footnote

This fits well with what I've read from this site; specifically Taln and Ash are the Herald POVs in the back five according to other WoB. The interesting tidbit here is that "two of them claim to be Heralds" with the implied "but...." in his tone.
