#### Ruro272

In hindsight this seems like a really obvious question now (laugh), but I think it's really interesting that Elsecallers can travel to other planets too--we didn't know that before.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are hints in the names on the map of Shadesmar.

#### Footnote

Since getting this answer I found out a few more things about this on the 17th Shard. It looks like previous WoB confirmed that there are hints in the names of things on Shadesmar somewhat related to Worldhopping, and we also know that the Expanse of the Densities is a planet that we already know. He could be alluding to those tidbits with this answer, who knows.
