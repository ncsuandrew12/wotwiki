#### Ruro272

Is there a separate "Shadesmar" (cognitive realm) for each planet or is it one big place that are all connected with different regions for each planet.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's one big place with different sections.

#### Ruro272

So since its one big place, could spren travel to a different section that correlates with a different planet, such as the cognitive segment for Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They could do there, but they wouldn't usually...

#### Ruro272

Is that because Honor's influence is only on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Brandon gave sort of a noncommittal half nod, but looked doubtful himself. Maybe best to interpret this last answer as a RAFO rather than reading into it too much.)

#### Footnote

Brandon didn't say a lot about this, and unfortunately I don't remember his exact wording, but it was clear that spren could technically go to different regions within Shadesmar that correlate to different worlds, but for some reason they don't or won't. My guess would be simply because only on Roshar to the ideas of men give them power, and if they deviate away too far they lose that connection that makes them exist. Just a thought tho.
