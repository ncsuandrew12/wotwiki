#### Ruro272

Does Hoid have a Hemalurgically charged Nicrosil spike?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's... unlikely. Hoid would not want to open himself to the influence of Shards so using Hemalurgy on himself is unlikely. Although Hemalurgy is the easiest way to get other powers, he'd more likely do things the hard way.

#### Question

Alright, but would Nicrosil be the right metal to make a Hemalurgic spike if you did want to steal powers from another world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a good theory, you're theorizing well.
