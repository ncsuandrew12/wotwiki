# [Interview #244, Entry #3]: KOD Signing Report - Jeremiah](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=244#3)

#### Jeremiah

I got two questions about his writing process answered, one concerning when exactly he began WoT (if he knew he would write it while he was writing
*The Fallon Blood*
as Reagan O'Neal).

#### Robert Jordan

He said that there were a few things in his head, but nothing solid yet, nothing close to a coherent story. That didn't happen until a couple of years later.
