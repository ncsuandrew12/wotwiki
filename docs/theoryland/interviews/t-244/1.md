# [Interview #244: KOD Signing Report - Jeremiah, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=244#1)

#### Jeremiah

I was at the Santa Cruz signing on Saturday. Sorry I couldn't report sooner, I had to drive the 650 miles to get home first...

Santa Cruz wasn't really much different from all of the others before it, at least from what I've read.
