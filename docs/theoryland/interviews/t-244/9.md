# [Interview #244: KOD Signing Report - Jeremiah, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=244#9)

#### Jeremiah

I can't remember what, now, but some guy asked about something that RJ RAFO'd, and the guy just left after that!! I can't understand that, I was more than happy to be RAFO'd by the Creator himself!

There were a few other questions, but I don't remember them all now, and I apologize. But then he signed books, and I was the second in line for that. I left afterwards, since I didn't have any more hardcover books to be signed by the man.

Jeremiah.
