#### Robert Jordan

And then he RAFO'd my question about the Tinker caravan that Mat comes across in
*Lord of Chaos*
.

#### Jeremiah

Too bad, but at least that means that he will be answering that in the last book. And I still feel special that I got to ask three questions of him!!

#### Footnote

The scene is in
*Lord of Chaos*
, Chapter 22.
