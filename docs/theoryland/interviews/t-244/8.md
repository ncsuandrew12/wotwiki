# [Interview #244: KOD Signing Report - Jeremiah, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=244#8)

#### Question

Someone else asked about why the female characters don't seem to be as well done as the male characters, as if RJ spent less time on them.

#### Robert Jordan

To this RJ responded that he takes just as much time with the female characters as the male, and that his greatest compliment was women saying, "No man can write women that well."

#### Jeremiah

Well, the guy didn't look very happy about getting slapped down.
