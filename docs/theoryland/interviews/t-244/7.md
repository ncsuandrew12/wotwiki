# [Interview #244, Entry #7]: KOD Signing Report - Jeremiah](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=244#7)

#### Question

Another guy asked about how Rand has not been in the forefront of the series for the last few books, and he asked how long RJ knew that that would happen, or if it just happened.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that he knew it would happen from the beginning, because he wanted to show that the "man on the shining white horse, the man who is the only hope, he can only do what he does because of the help of ten thousand other people." He wanted to portray that Rand has to be at the Last Battle to win, but he cannot be the ONLY one there.
