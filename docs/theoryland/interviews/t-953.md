## Entry #1

#### rhandric

Quick note before I pass out, just wanted to let you guys know that I only ended up having time for a single question; I asked "if there are any humans who have found a way, or been given a way, to inhabit
*Tel'aran'rhiod*

[Freelancer and Wet @145/146](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-memory-of-light-tour-report-open-thread#323288)
