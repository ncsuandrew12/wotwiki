## [Entry #1](./t-953/1)

#### rhandric

Quick note before I pass out, just wanted to let you guys know that I only ended up having time for a single question; I asked "if there are any humans who have found a way, or been given a way, to inhabit
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
beyond a normal lifetime, without being a Hero of the Horn" for
[Freelancer and Wet @145/146](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-memory-of-light-tour-report-open-thread#323288)
:P (I figured my
*Callandor*

#### Brandon Sanderson

The answer was (Paraphrased): I don't know. It's possible, but I don't know if anyone has done so.

## [Entry #2](./t-953/2)

#### rhandric

I'll do a more extensive writeup in the next few days, but in general the intro/Brandon and Harriet talk/general Q&A went similar to the other signings.
