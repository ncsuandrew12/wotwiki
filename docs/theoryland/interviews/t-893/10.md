#### Drew McCaffrey

My name is Drew McCaffrey; I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado. I've been an absolutely huge fan of the series for eleven years now, and I just recently graduated as a creative writing major, and I'm a writer because of the Wheel of Time. [applause, cheers]

My question is in regards to a debate that I've had with my cousin and a couple of my friends for a while now. Is it possible for a channeler to be tied to the Horn of Valere?

#### Maria Simons

(Brandon passes mic to Maria, laughter) Um, I think I'm gonna have to say, that's a really good question. [laughter] I honestly can't say why not.

#### Drew McCaffrey

(to his friends) HA! [laughter, applause]

#### Maria Simons

But! But I would really love to do some research before giving an absolute
*definitive*
answer [laughter] and I can't do that right now.

#### Drew McCaffrey

Would Lews Therin's soul be tied to the Horn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lews Therin! He was.

#### Maria Simons

Well yeah. [laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was recognized.

#### Maria Simons

That's right. Absolutely.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was recognized, but was he tied to the Horn? Do we have
*confirmation*
of that happening? [laughter] Or they just know him? See, he's trying to trick us into saying things.

#### Harriet McDougal

Maria's saying she'll have to look it up and post it.

#### Drew McCaffrey

Ooh. Agreed. Well, thank you very much, all of you, for being here tonight and...yeah. [laughter, applause]

#### Footnote

Robert Jordan
[confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=86#3)
that Rand was a hero of the Horn.
