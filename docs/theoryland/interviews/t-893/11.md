# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#11)

#### Sarah Bylund

Okay, so, I usually don't do this kind of thing, because I hate being in front of people, so...but recently, I saw in someone's basement a box that was labeled Stuff That People Gave Brandon...and, I looked in it. I did. [laughs] And I did see some black licorice, and so I guess you don't like that...

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I like it.

#### Sarah Bylund

Well, it's sitting in there; you should eat it! [laughter] So, I was wondering though, for Harriet and Brandon, what's the strangest thing, or maybe the coolest thing you've gotten from a Wheel of Time person, someone just giving you something.

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Tell us who you are!

#### Sarah Bylund

I'm Sarah, sorry. [laughter]

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, I got a lovely handmade wall hanging that was sort of like a quilt, with various pieces having to do with things in the series that the maker liked the best. And I also got a very charming, little cuddly
*grolm*
. Made out of green...a green gingham. And really sweet. With no teeth!

#### Brandon Sanderson

(consults with Peter) I got...I've gotten a lot of cool things. It's hard to pick out just one. Like, I've gotten nifty buttons and bracelets, and I got a pen that was handmade and carved...(to audience) What?

#### Audience

And cards!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lots of cards, yes. [laughter] I've gotten lots of mac'n'cheese; people give that to me. I've gotten various types of salts, since people know I like salt. One of the cool ones was, somebody made their license plate TAVEREN, and they got two of them, and they put one on the back, and they gave me the other. [laughter] (to audience) Was that you? Were you raising your hand? No...that's you!? Hey! I'm glad I remembered you. [applause] So I have a nifty TAVEREN license plate; it's not from Utah though, so I can't put it on my car but...yeah. Where's it from? It's like...

#### Chris Wells

No, it is Utah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a Utah plate? Oh okay, so I could stick it on...oh, I can't stick it on my car, it's licensed to you. [laughter] Yeah.

#### Chris Wells

But you can park illegally!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I can park illegally, that's right. I could park and the ticket, it goes to you, right? [laughter] That's how that works?

#### Sarah Bylund

Thanks.
