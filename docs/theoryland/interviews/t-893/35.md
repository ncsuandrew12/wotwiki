# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#35)

#### Bradley Johnson

I'm Bradley Johnson. I'm local. I'm fairly new to the series. My question is primarily for Jason, but it's open to anybody. I believe you've had this question before, but a few months ago there were a few articles on tor.com as a kind of recap of the series as a whole. The last one was, "What are titles for hypothetical Wheel of Time musical numbers." [laughter] And I was wondering if you had anything to add to that, or if anyone else had anything to add to that.

#### Jason Denzel

I'm going to pass that along. They tried to drag some answers out of me for that, and I passed on it. I'm going to stick to film. So there you go.

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, there are a number of titles of songs in the books, including alternate titles, as I'm sure you know. And you could write your own—well, for fan purposes...I mean, you can write the risqué versions and the nice versions [laughter]...and I've always loved "The Wind that Shakes the Willow". [laughter]
