# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#20)

#### Jeremy Wunders

Hi, I'm Jeremy Wunders from Las Vegas, Nevada. So, a while back ago, Wizards of the Coast produced a roleplaying game for the Wheel of Time, and although not the best translation of the world, it was a really good effort nonetheless, and it brought the fans together to create a lot of great material, and when that kind of faded off and sputtered into nothingness, some of us have been rabidly waiting for this last book in hopes that it'd open another door for another tabletop RPG. Is there anything of that nature in the works?

#### Harriet McDougal

No. And also, I should say that the film rights to the Wheel of Time are at present being developed at Universal, and not—I'm sorry to say—as a series, but it's another medium, and what—
*que sera, que sera*
, as Doris Day and Alfred Hitchcock taught us all those years ago.

#### Jeremy Wunders

Thank you very much.
