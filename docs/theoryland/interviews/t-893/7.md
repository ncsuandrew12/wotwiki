# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#7)

#### Justin Ellis

My name is Justin Ellis; I've read several of your novels. Now that you're at the top of your game, Brandon...what do you want to do—what
*would*
you do—if you weren't a writer? [laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd be laying in a gutter somewhere, unable to produce anything valuable for society. [laughter] I don't know. I mean, I was always [?] My mom sent me to school to become a doctor, but that was never gonna happen. [laughter] I don't know. I mean, I went through my grad program—all the other grad students were doing all this work to go get PhDs and stuff, and I didn't do any of that. I was writing books, only. And if I hadn't sold a novel, then, I don't know. Maybe I'd be still working at the hotel, the graveyard shift I worked at for years, writing books overnight. I wanted to be a writer, and I put pretty much everything into it. I'd probably be teaching English at a community college somewhere, and still writing two books a year without anyone ever reading them.

#### Jason Denzel

And playing a lot of Magic the Gathering. [laughter, cheers]
