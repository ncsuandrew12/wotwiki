# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#16)

#### Paul Williams

(split from another question) ...And a question chosen vicariously for another friend: has the Creator been very intimately and directly connected to the story, or is he kind of like the absent god, where he set things in motion and left?

#### Harriet McDougal

(split from another question) ...And then, the question of the role of the Creator, by which you mean God, not the writer?

#### Paul Williams

Yes, exactly. [laughter]

#### Harriet McDougal

As you know, he said he didn't believe writers who said, "I just work to a certain point and then the characters take it over." He said, "I don't believe that for a minute." [laughter] Actually,
[what he said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=96#19)
was, "
*I*
am Old Testament god, and my fist is in the middle of my characters' lives." But the way he envisions the Light in these books is that they have a very immediate sense of the Creator, which isâ€”
[they don't need churches](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#7)
, because he's right there for them. Not that they don't believe; they believe so deeply that they live their lives
*in*
a sense of God, the Creator.

#### Paul Williams

And the question is also, has the Creator been intimately connected to Rand's journey? Did the Creator purposefully set Rand up to be the Dragon Reborn?

#### Harriet McDougal

I think only in the sense that the Creator is perceived by the characters as being pretty intimately involved in all their lives.

#### Paul Williams

Thank you.
*Tai'shar!*
