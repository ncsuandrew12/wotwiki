#### Kevin Butler

My name is Kevin Butler; my wife Diana is back here, and I met her when she was reading
*The Dragon Reborn*
, and even though I was going out with her roommate at the time, we hit it off quite well. [laughter, cheers] I was wondering if, now that you have a break from writing the Wheel of Time for a while, if you're going to consider the outrigger novels. We'd love to hear more about Mat.

#### Harriet McDougal

I think I'm the villain who should answer this. [laughter]

#### Kevin Butler

of people sharecropping in his universe, and this would have been such a thing, and I think my darling husband would come back and do terrible things to me [laughter] and so there won't be any outriggers. And it's a pity; it would have been fun to see Shara. [oooohs] Seanchan! The Seanchan, I mean; excuse me. [laughter]
