# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#12)

#### Brian Lickey

Hi. I'm Brian Lickey from Orem, Utah. Two questions, and I hope I'm not encroaching on Waygate with this one, but in regards to the Encyclopedia: are we going to have a full
*Karaethon Cycle*
,
*Prophecies of the Shadow*
and all that? And second, are you going to have exhaustive troop movement matters? [laughter] Because I know that back in March, Brandon was mentioning
[consulting with a strategist](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=757#3)
over writing a particular chapter of this book, which would lead one to believe that it's fairly confusing. [laughter]

#### Maria Simons

The complete
*Karaethon Cycle*
will not be in there, because
[Jim didn't write the complete one out](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=67#8)
. Same for the
*Prophecies*
. I'm not sure about the maps...(looks at Harriet)

#### Harriet McDougal

I do think you'll find that, as published, the strategic movements are really very clear.

#### Brian Lickey

Thank you.
