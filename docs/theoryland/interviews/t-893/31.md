# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#31)

#### Aaron

Hey, I'm Aaron from West Jordan. I started reading the series in middle school, and discovered Brandon in high school, and was overjoyed when I heard he was taking over. This question is mostly for Harriet, and anyone that's not Peter or Brandon. Did you ever finish Mistborn, and have you read any other of Brandon's books, and which was your favorite.

#### Harriet McDougal

Ahahaha. [laughter] I did a guest-edit on
*The Way of Kings*
, which is a super book. [applause]
