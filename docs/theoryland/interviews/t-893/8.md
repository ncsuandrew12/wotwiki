# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#8)

#### Anthony Gould

My name is Anthony Gould. I've been reading the series quite a bit. I've read 1-13 ten times. [murmurs, woos] And so...and I actually planned to read
*A Memory of Light*
ten times in a row before I read any other book...[laughter]...just so I have something to say instead of saying, "I've read every other book ten times, and I've read this one once." That'd be bad.

But yeah, so my question I think is directed at Harriet, mostly. I was thinking, well, is the character Mat Cauthon—did Robert Jordan base that character on him?

#### Harriet McDougal

Maria was saying something earlier today that would suggest what you think he did...? (looks at Maria)

#### Maria Simons

Somewhat.

#### Harriet McDougal

Somewhat. I would go for that. He told somebody, I think more than once, that all the female characters were based on
*me*
. [laughter] In the same way, I think that
[perhaps he based all the male characters on him](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=26#23)
, including Padan Fain and the like. [laughter]

#### Maria Simons

Traits he had in common with Mat: There's one point Mat's talking to Olver about turtle shells, and Mat's thinking about a turtle shell he had. Jim—Robert Jordan—had a shelf of turtle shells in the office, and he did like to play cards and other games. [laughter] Yeah, there were aspects of Jim in Mat.

#### Harriet McDougal

And to quit a job as a civilian engineer working for the United States Navy in order to write fiction...if that isn't the act of a gambler, I don't know what is. [laughter, applause]

#### Anthony Gould

Alright, well thank you then!
