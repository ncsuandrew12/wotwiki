# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#36)

#### Brandon Sanderson

We blame people like these, that came up with this, but I do want to—and thank you for your question—I do want to hand...(to Matt) You had a correction on something we said earlier? Do you have it? Okay, Matt's going to correct us from
[what we were unable to answer](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#23)
, because Robert Jordan apparently gave an answer.

#### Matt Hatch

So, there was a question about the Dragon soul, and whether that was a title or not—was that your question?—so,
[he did answer](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#20)
. Someone asked him, because it had to do with...the entirety of the question was, you know, can it change? Could it be a woman, could it be a female? Would it be the same person in a new Turning? And his point, his answer was, it could not be female—that the soul would remain the same gender—and he also said that it would not necessarily be Rand in the next Turning. So in other words, it would still be that same soul, but it would not be—necessarily—the Rand story, the next time around. It might be...whatever. And he talked about it just because, looking at the Pattern as things change in Turnings, little things are going to change, or I guess in this case, maybe it's something bigger. So, I don't know if that answers your question, but that is answered again.

#### Adam Simmons

The question was really more about Lews Therin as the original Dragon, or as the original Dragon that we know about, and was he born to be the Dragon, or is that something that he kind of grew into?

#### Matt Hatch

It's the soul, the soul is the Dragon.

#### Adam Simmons

Okay, so he was born to it.
