# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#18)

#### Ben Leveridge

It's times like this it's nice to be short; you don't have to worry about the microphone. [laughter] I'm Ben Leveridge; I'm from here in Orem and Provo, and my question is probably mostly for Maria.

So we have seen several examples in the books recently about things being Healed that we didn't think could be Healed—severing, madness. We've also seen in the past that there are links that a person can have physically to the Dark One; Asmodean had a link to the Dark One, which allowed him to funnel off some of the madness, and Rand severed that.

So my question is along those lines. Can a similar kind of thing happen to one who has forcibly turned to the Shadow with a circle of Myrddraal and channelers—can that be severed or Healed, turning them back to the Light, or to whatever their normal state of mind would be?

#### Maria Simons

Read and find out!

#### Ben Leveridge

Yes! First RAFO! Thank you. [laughter, cheers]

#### Brandon Sanderson

She was just so excited to give a RAFO. We don't get to RAFO much in these things.
