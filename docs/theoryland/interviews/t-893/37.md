# [Interview #893: AMOL Midnight Release Q&A, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=893#37)

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, we are going to come to
*an*
ending here, but before we do, we have give-aways. [applause] And then, as a quick reminder, we have already signed all of the books, and you're going to be able to pick them up, and if you live locally, you could just grab your book—or even if you don't—and take off; you don't have to wait around—and you can find me at another point and get it personalized; I do plenty of signings around. If you want to hang out and get it personalized, I'll be here personalizing. If you have a question that didn't get answered, Maria is going to be sitting nearby answering questions until about 3 a.m. [laughter, applause] And the later it gets, the more sketchy the answers may become; we're not sure. [laughter] We are going to let Harriet go back to the hotel and get some rest.

#### Harriet McDougal

#### Brandon Sanderson

But, you know, I do want to even personally give Harriet a thank-you for coming out for this. [applause, standing ovation]

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, oh! I would like to give you
*all*
a personal thank-you for coming out for tonight. Y'all have just been wonderful. And, thank you very much.

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Harriet McDougal

I want to wait for the give-aways.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, we're going to do the give-aways right now, and then we'll close it out. So...
