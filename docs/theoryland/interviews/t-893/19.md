#### Chris Capelin

My name is Chris Capelin, from Los Angeles. I had a question for Harriet. It's for me, and for my really good friend Andrew who is without a doubt the biggest Wheel of Time fan in this room. [boos, jeers] Really, really. You're wrong; you're all wrong!

But the question is, if money wasn't an issue, and you had any budget that you wanted, what in your opinion would be the best way to put the Wheel of Time on the screen?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, I think that it's so
*big*
, and so rich, that its most wonderful appearance on film would be as a television series. [cheers, applause] It really would.

#### Chris Capelin

Then I'm personally pleading with you to never let it be made into movies, because that'll absolutely ruin it.
