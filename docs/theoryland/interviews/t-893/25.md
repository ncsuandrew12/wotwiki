#### Question

My name is [?] from [?] Utah. This is for you, Brandon. In his book
*Maphead*
, your former roommate and
*Jeopardy!*
champion [Ken Jennings] said that he liked having you as a roommate because you made him look good for the ladies. Would you like to defend yourself in public? [laughter, applause]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, referencing Ken, the second-most-famous roommate that lived together during that time...[laughter, cheers, applause]...I would have to say that I didn't take any liberties in my books to take public potshots at him, because I'm more secure than that. [laughter, applause] Our other roommate is actually right here filming usâ€”Earl [Cahill], who was our roommate...[?].
