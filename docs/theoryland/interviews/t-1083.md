## [Entry #1](./t-1083/1)

#### Jeremy

What is the home planet of the Ones Above (from
*Sixth of the Dusk*
)?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

They are from a planet you have seen before.

## [Entry #2](./t-1083/2)

#### Jeremy

How much can you explain about Dalinar's armor and how he was able to "mentally unlatch his gauntlet"?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

This is definitely something a regular person couldn't do with regular armor. You can see in his visions hints of how the armor used to work. This is similar to Shardblades, and more will be revealed later.

## [Entry #3](./t-1083/3)

#### Jeremy

What are the pre-requisites for someone becoming Returned? Does it depend on how much Breath they have?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It does not depend on the quantity of breath, but I'm not revealing the specific pre-requisites, since I need to save something for Nightblood.

## [Entry #4](./t-1083/4)

#### Jeremy

What's going on with the Mistborn movie, and how can I get involved?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

One of the conditions I set for the movie is that there has to be an open casting call. The film branch of Little Orbit has purchased the rights. If they complete the game within 18 months, they can renew their rights and keep working on producing the movie; otherwise, the rights will go up for sale to someone else.

#### Footnote

Little Orbit is the company making Mistborn: Birthright.

## [Entry #5](./t-1083/5)

#### Jeremy

Is the order of the Ideals fixed? E.g. does Kaladin have to say the Windrunner Ideals in a specific order, or are they situation-specific?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, the sequence is fixed. The oaths for each order are essentially a progression of understanding of the kind of person that each Order of Knights Radiant is trying to produce. The specific wording of each Ideal is not fixed, but the overall idea of each Ideal, and the order in which they are spoken, is.

## [Entry #6](./t-1083/6)

#### Jeremy

Does Wit specifically treat people differently when he knows they're going to have a spren bond? (E.g. Renarin, Dalinar)

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, Wit treats people differently, but it is not because of present or nascent spren bonds. He has an opinion of what each person needs to hear. He isn't always correct in this opinion, but he tries to give people what he thinks they need. In Dalinar's case, he simply has too much respect for the man to be glib. In Renarin's case, he believes that the boy has had more than enough breaking down, and is much more in need of building up.

## [Entry #7](./t-1083/7)

#### Jeremy

When Honor speaks of his inability to see the future, he likens it to a shattering window. Is this related to the fact that in the not-too-distant future, he himself will be splintered? Or is it more a matter of Intent; e.g., Cultivation (and Preservation?) is geared toward future development, whereas Honor is geared toward current behavior.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

This is not related to his impending splintering, it is a matter of differing Intents.

## [Entry #8](./t-1083/8)

#### Jeremy

There are hints in
*Words of Radiance*
that the Thrill is tied to an individual entity that Taravangian has studied, possibly one of the Unmade. Does this have anything to do with the hints of why the Knights Radiant turned away? Were the Unmade some of those who did whatever-it-was that tore them apart?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

[This is the one where he stopped me partway through asking, probably due to the wording]. Does it have anything to do with it? Yes. Is it the root cause or the primary reason? I'm not going to reveal that right now.

## [Entry #9](./t-1083/9)

#### Jeremy

Syl gives Kaladin the choice to have any number of weapons or a shield. Pattern can be equally a sword or a small knife. Are spren limited to being items of war or could they be put to other uses? Could the surge binders less geared toward battle use their spren to make ladders, rope, etc?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

No, this is not restricted to articles of war.

## [Entry #10](./t-1083/10)

#### Jeremy

We know that Mistborn needed to Snap, and Surgebinders needed have the cracks in their souls filled. But what about the people in
*Warbreaker*
or
*Elantris*
? Is cracking and snapping only required on certain worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

This is universal to the cosmere; however, in certain magic systems / on certain worlds, this is easier than others.
