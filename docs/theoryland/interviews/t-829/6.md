# [Interview #829: Robert Jordan's Next Series!, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=829#6)

#### Dragonmount

How many books will there be in this series? (I mean... REALLY...how many? heh heh)

#### Robert Jordan

The plan is for two sets of three books each, much more tightly focused. In many ways, The Wheel of Time is a story of nations and cultures undergoing change as much as it is a story of Rand or Mat or anyone else. I still intend to take you to a very different world—in some ways MUCH more different than the world of WoT—but I won't have quite so many story lines running.

Yes, I think it's pretty exciting, too. This thing has been bubbling around in the back of my head since about 91 or 92, so it has had a good long gestation. And more to come, since I haven't finished Wheel yet, and I'm certainly not going to do any work on Infinity until I do.
