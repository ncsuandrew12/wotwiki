# [Interview #829, Entry #4]: Robert Jordan's Next Series!](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=829#4)

#### Dragonmount

Will you write this before or after you finish the WoT prequels?

#### Robert Jordan

Infinity of Heaven almost certainly will be written before the prequels, though I might do them between the Infinity books.

You know, the reception of
*New Spring: the Novel*
surprised me. Some people were upset or even angry that I wasn't getting on with the main story. I even heard people say there was no reason to read the novel if you had read the novella. (That, by the way, is very wrong. There is stuff in that novel that won't ever be anywhere else, including the test for Aes Sedai and the reasons why certain people have the relationships they do in the books among other things.) Anyway, given the reactions of so many people, I decided to shelve the other two prequels for a while.
