# [Interview #1139: Shadows of Self-BYU, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1139#9)

#### Lightning

My question to Brandon was why the Lord Ruler spiked himself. I didn't clarify initially that I meant with hemalurgic spikes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Once I did, Brandon said he thought they were not hemalurgic but only metalminds, and Peter backed him up on that.
