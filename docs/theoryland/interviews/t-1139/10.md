# [Interview #1139: Shadows of Self-BYU, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1139#10)

#### Shadow Guardian

We know that Hoid likes to collect various "trinkets" and powers from the various shard worlds he visits. If he could, would Hoid choose to have access to 'every' magic system within the Cosmere, or are there some that he would rather avoid for any reason?

#### Brandon Sanderson
