# [Interview #1139: Shadows of Self-BYU, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1139#6)

#### Question

Someone asked Brandon about Allomantic bronze detecting Feruchemy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon responded with yes, but no one on Scadrial knows how to do this (at least now). The interesting thing is that Brandon said that Allomantic bronze could theoretically detect any "Kinetic Investiture". Note that I am capitalizing Kinetic there, as Innate Investiture was. Pretty awesome to get that new term. I am assuming it is the difference between a metalmind being Invested and actually using Feruchemy, or a person having a lot of Breath and someone actually Awakening.
