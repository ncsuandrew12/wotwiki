# [Interview #1139: Shadows of Self-BYU, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1139#5)

#### Question

Someone asked for a "future quote from Harmony." Brandon said that no one had ever asked that before.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wasn't sure if the quote would be exact, so we'll need to check back around Mistborn 9, but he wrote in the book: "It is yours." That's awesome.
