Just got my hands on a copy. I'll post when I've finished it.

you snake! i'm jealous. are you doing a blurb or something, or is that just a friendship/professional perk?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I offered to blurb it, but I'll bet it's too late to get one in. (And I'm not sure he'll need one.) But I'll send one in. Mostly, I think Pat's just being nice to me.
