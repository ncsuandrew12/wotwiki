What new book release are you most looking forward to in 2011?

*The Heroes*
by Joe Abercrombie

Currently reading both his books and Malazan depending on what I feel like reading.

The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss. I've waited a long time for it. Hopefully it's as good as the first one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm in the middle of it. So far, it's just as good.

#### Khathaar

Hah, is this Sanderson on reddit? If so, awesome.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's me. Confirmed by my twitter account, which is verified.

#### MasterShredder

That's just mean. and nice at the same time. Were you born with a heart full of neutrality?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. Well, if it helps, I wasn't going to say anything, because I don't want to come off as bragging. But he/she did say they hoped it was as good as the first. Pat sent me a copy early, and as thanks, I think it's partially my duty to let people know how awesome it is. This trilogy is going to be one of the greats of our era.
