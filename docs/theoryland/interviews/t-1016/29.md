Could someone write me...

a fucking depressing sci-fi-esque story?

EDIT: NOT a three sentence story. I've been bored and wanting to read something like this. Go ahead and write a decent length story. Not a novel or anything. Something that would take a few minutes... Er, please?

Some classics, in case you haven't read them:

Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut

The Ones who walk away from Omelas by UKLG
