Hey r/writing: I just finished a novel. Any tips on finding a literary agent?

It's my third. I got decent feedback on the first two—just no publication. I'm polishing up my pitch and contacting agents who expressed interest in my previous attempts. I wonder if you guys can give me any tips.

Or! If you happen to be a literary agent, are you interested in a story about an amnesiac ninja who has to save the world from a demon invasion? I think it's pretty fun!

Go to the bookstore. Find a book on the shelf that is somewhat like your book. Find out who represents them. Repeat.

#### canadianwriter

Get published first.... I know it sounds strange but thats how it works.

#### Brandon Sanderson

A combination of what canadianwriter said and sblinn said is a good start. I suggest that you start researching publishers, start submitting to publishers—but also start researching and submitting to agents at the same time.

The best two tips on getting agents I can give are this:
  
1) Learn to write a great query. 2) Learn where agents in your field can be found, and go meet them in person.

For what it's worth, I did get an offer on my first book without an agent. I called an agent I'd sent other books to, and had rejected, to handle the negotiations and he's been my agent ever since. I met the editor I eventually sold to at the World Fantasy Convention in 2000 or 2001 and the agent at the Nebula Awards a year or so before that.

I never did learn how to write a good query. It has helped a lot of others I know, however.
