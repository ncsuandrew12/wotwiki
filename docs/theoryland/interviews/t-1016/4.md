[Top 10 Fantasy/Sci-fi Books I Want Now — Suvudu](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/01/top-10-2011-books-i-want-now.html)

Is it me, or is it very odd that the first two items on this list are books by authors who have multiple books out, none of which Shawn has read. You'd think that if he was so eager to read their work, he'd...I don't know, look up one of their other books?

That said, I'm quite eager for new Abraham novels. I've made no secret of the fact that I like his work.
