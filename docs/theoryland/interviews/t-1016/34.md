Sometimes it's lonely feeling like the only person who has absolutely no interest in fantasy and sci fi here. Enjoy your books.

#### Question

You're not alone! Holla for literary fiction.

#### dermballs

Sorry wasn't dissing. Just lamenting. Seriously enjoy them. Read what you love. It's a cool collection it just makes me sad when I see that many books in one place and then realise I probably wouldn't want to read any of them.

#### Question

Its cool, I knew you weren't, and didn't mean for my statement to invoke sarcasm. I'm trying to get through
*The Way of Kings*
currently. Not sure why I'm reading my second biggest book so early, but ah well. Its decent.

Second longest? I demand to know which author wrote one longer. It's that Williams guy, isn't it. I need to have him eliminated.

(Joking. Otherland is awesome.)

—Brandon S.

#### Question

Oh my. You need to tell me the correct pronunciation of Szeth, sir. And aye, the last book in the Otherland has around 150 extra pages.

P.S. Read up all the "lore" I could find on Adonalsium this morning. Psyched.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Closest to "Zeth" but really a split between "Seth" and "Zeth." Basically, how it is written with a very soft s at the front.

Out of curiosity, how many pages would tWoK come out to in mass mark paper back form?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's hard to say, since publishers play with these things all the time. Notice
*Wise Man's Fear*
, which is shorter than
*The Way of Kings*
by a bit, but ended up 100 pages longer in hardcover as DAW decided to go with a larger font. I won't be surprised if
*Otherland*
ends up longer in the end, though. Tad likes his long books.

William's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series heralded the true beginning of my fantasy reading career. I was in Eighth grade, and I remember watching my bother read it, wondering with amazement at how he had the resolve to finish not just one large book, but four. I endeavored to be like him, so I started the first book shortly after he had finished it. I remember the first 200 pages were gruelingly slow, taking me nearly a month alone. Before this the largest books I've read were Harry Potter, so the transition from the fast-paced young adult lit. to adult lit. was devastating on my young mind. Only after I had gotten those 200 pages read, I started to get the feel of the story and where it was taking me. I began to feel comfortable with the length, and the next month I pushed out the last 3000 some pages. After finally finishing it I was devastated to leave the characters I was just beginning to know behind, but thus was my love for lengthy fantasy stories born.

I have not yet had to opportunity to read
*The Way of Kings*
, but if it in any way resembles what you achieved in Mistborn or
*Warbreaker*
, I feel I will enjoy it immensely. Keep doing what you do, love the work you've put out so far.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have very fond memories of M, S, and T myself. I can actually place where I first saw the
*Dragonbone Chair*
on the shelf—funny, how I can do that with so many books that became important to me—at a bookstore. The paperback had that striking Whelan cover, with the open window on the front looking into colored end pages.

Unlike you young whippersnappers today, I had to wait out that trilogy. (Still have the third in hardcover.) Wonderful storytelling. It was one of the great building blocks in Epic Fantasy's earlier years. Before Martin, before Jordan, we had Williams. (And we still do, of course. I've enjoyed his newer writing too, but this trilogy is what I regard most fondly.)
