r/Fantasy Recommend me a book to borrow from work.

So for those of you that don't know my employer Barnes&Noble has a policy where employees can borrow any hardcover book in the store for 2 weeks. I just recently borrowed
*Farlander*
and have since finished it\*. And I find myself in need of something new to read. We have the Internet at work so I will be able to periodically check reddit throughout my shift this evening.

So here are the requirements:

- Obviously I would prefer fantasy but I will also accept Sci-fi or really any kind of fiction if I were to put my interests into order it would be as follows Fantasy>scifi>historical>everything else.
  
- It has to be currently available in hard cover.
  
- It has to be in stock within my store.
*Now on this last bit I don't expect you guys to go searching through bn.com punching in the zip for my store (01527) to see if it is available I can totally do that while being bored in music/dvd dept.*

If you have any questions about my taste feel free to ask. Otherwise I look forward to your input.

\*I don't know how I feel about this book The world and characters are all very interesting. However the ending left quite a bit to be desired.

EDIT: thanks for all the suggestions i was fortunate enough to have a copy of
*The Way of Kings*
in my store that I was able to borrow

*The Way of Kings*
by Brandon Sanderson.

You are a scholar and a gentleman. (Or, perhaps, woman.) However, I did hear from the publisher that B&N is on no-replenish/return on the book now that the holidays are over. B&N tends to cycle hardcovers more than some other bookstores—they order a large stock up front, then keep them on hand for three or four months. There's really only a 1/10 chance that they've got a KINGS in stock.

TheFinn, I've got some ARCs of it, though, and might be able to have one sent to your store for you.

As for books you can borrow...it depends on your preferences. If you like lyrical, literary style books,
*The Bards of Bone Plain*
by Patricia A. McKillip might still be in stock in hardcover.

If you like gritty heroic,
*The Heroes*
by Joe Abercrombie releases in about a week. You may want to hold out for that.

I think that a publisher just did a new
*Last Unicorn*
re-release in hardcover, which is a great book. Also, the Gunslinger graphic novels have a new collection coming out, which might be in hardcover. I've heard good things about them, but haven't read them.

Your best bet, though?
*Wise Man's Fear*
, Pat Rothfuss, coming in a month or so.
