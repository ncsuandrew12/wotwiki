I'm thirsting for fantasy...

But I want something fresh and exciting. I am tired of reading the same homage to Tolkien in every book I look in. I'm tired of seeing the typical party of the brave warrior type, the silly rogue type, the smart magic user and so on. I'm tired of black cloaked villains that all have the same goal. I want to be plunged into a world of magic that I have never seen before.

I also don't want Urban or modern fantasy right now. I still do want something old about the story. I want there to be some dragons or maybe a nymph or two. I would love some Greek or Celtic or any type of mythological influence. But I still want it to be fresh. I want a book or series that decided to do something new with old formula. Can anyone suggest anything that might fit my needs?

Well, The Wheel of Time has strong connections to Norse Mythology.

Brandon Sanderson. Anything by him, really. I'd recommend
*Warbreaker*
for what you're looking for.
*The Name of the Wind*
by Patrick Rothfuss is also incredible. Both of these authors have amazing magic systems, and Sanderson's are different with every book.

Now, if you're looking for something completely anti-Tolkien read
*The Black Company*
by Glen Cook. Essentially there are no heroes, it's told from a human perspective. The characters feel real, no higher moral obligation (for the most part) to help others. Really strong Indian mythological influence in these books.

All my friends have been telling me to read Wheel of Time. I have the first novel from one of them but the writing is a bit too flowery for me. My friends tell me to stick with it so I will try.

I really do have to check out this Sanderson fellow, you're the second to suggest him. I have Rothfuss's book already and I'm simply waiting for the release of the second book to start the first. I'm terribly impatient when it comes for waiting for book so I only read series when at least two in the series are out.

I've never read anything with Indian mythological influence so
*The Black Company*
might be really refreshing for me. I'll have to add that to my to-read list as well.

Reply from that Sanderson guy here. Drop me a PM with your email, if you want, and I'll send you a PDF of the first Mistborn book.

However, looking at what you said above, I'm thinking you might want to try Jim Butcher's Codex Alera books. (
*Furies of the Calderon*
is the first.) It's fast-paced epic fantasy with a Roman feel. Also, look up
*Tigana*
by Guy Kay. It's my go-to suggestion for people who are looking for fantasy with a little more depth to it.
