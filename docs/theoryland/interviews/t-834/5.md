# [Interview #834: KOD Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834#5)

Then came a lady who told Mr. Jordan that she was there because her husband loved his books, but unfortunately he couldn't make it himself. "Thanks," RJ said, "but you should try the books yourself!" During this exchange, I asked one of the assistants if Mr. Jordan would sign issues of the comic book today. She told me, "It's not hardcover, so I don't think so." I asked her, "Is that a 'no,' or should I ask him?" And she responded, "It's a 'no.'"

So that was that. No talk to the crowd. No signing of the comic books. Nothing special at all (except, of course, meeting the man and exchanging a few words with him, and having him sign my books). I was so disappointed that I decided not to go around the line a second time to have him sign my quite-battered copy of
*Lord of Chaos*
. I would bring it next time. If he'd have been signing the comics, I would have stayed, certainly.
