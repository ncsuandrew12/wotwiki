# [Interview #834: KOD Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834#7)

#### David Funke

So that was the signing. It was quite nice to exchange words with the man, and to have his sign my copy of his books. But, compared to the CoT signing, which was at a much better time of day (6:30 or 7:00) and in a much bigger Barnes and Nobles, this one was a disappointment. And, the fact that he did not sign the comics really was sad for me. Even though I'm not thrilled with them so far, I think that having the comics signed would be quite special, as they are already rare and signed copies of his hardcover novels are pretty easy to come by.

Do I recommend going to your local signing? Sure - it's Robert Jordan, after all, and we're all obviously fans. I just hope that you have a bit of a better show than I had, something more akin to what I experienced at the CoT signing. And if you get him to sign the comic books, well, then I'm a jealous RainGod!

Enjoy the books, guys and gals. And Mr. Jordan, if you read this...Thanks!
