# [Interview #834: KOD Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834#2)

#### David Funke

I took a quick look at the area set aside for the signingâ€”no chairs, no podium. Nothing to suggest that Mr. Jordan would grace the crowd with a few words. Which, compared to the CoT signing, was certainly unfortunate.

I found my way to the back of the line, wich had about 30 people. There, I waited. A few people chatted, some answered cellphones (this RainGod included!), but most were unsurprisingly reading the Prologue to
*Knife of Dreams*
. (Personally, I still had 60 pages of CoT to go...bad time managment on my part!)

At 12:30 on the dot, the line started moving, but not to any wide space where Mr. Jordan could address us. We went straight to the signing table. It turns out that my lack of a tape recorder didn't matter; Mr. Jordan did not say a few words in front of the crowd. No pronunciations, no words of wisdom, and no questions from the audience.

Certainly it was a big disappointment after the big fun of the CoT signing.
