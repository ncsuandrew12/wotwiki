# [Interview #834: KOD Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834#4)

#### David Funke

The next guy took a picture with Mr. Jordan, seeming pleased as punch when the author asked him to step around the table so they could take a picture together. This guy also thanked Mr. Jordan for "the blog," and I think we all can extend those same appreciations. It's really wonderful of him.

#### Robert Jordan

He reiterated, though, that his recent high activity there was not representative of the time he'd spend at the blog once he was writing full-time again, after the tour. One post a week, maybe once every 10 days, is what he expects. Personally, I still think that's plenty.
