# [Interview #834, Entry #3]: KOD Signing Report - David Funke](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834#3)

#### David Funke

As I starting moving towards Mr. Jordan, I prepared my books to be signed, by turning to the title/author page. I had with me:
*Knife of Dreams
New Spring: The Novel*
,
*Lord of Chaos*
, and issues one and two of
*Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time: New Spring*
comic book. My plan was to go around the line 3 times in order to get them all signed. I chose
*New Spring: The Novel*
and
*Knife of Dreams*
for the first pass through.

As I got close, I heard Mr. Jordan answering other people's questions. Mentions of "Aes Sedai" and "Seanchan" whispered through the air, though I couldn't hear much more than those. When I rounded a corner and was in sight of Mr. Jordan, (only 3 people in front of me), I got to hear more conversation.

#### Robert Jordan

One gentleman told Mr. Jordan that his books are being read by our troops overseas. Mr. Jordan seemed pleased about that, and mentioned that he tried to go across to the Mideast to appear with the USO, but no dice (from what little I heard).
