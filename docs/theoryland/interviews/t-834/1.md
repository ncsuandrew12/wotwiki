# [Interview #834: KOD Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834#1)

#### David Funke

Hey Jason and Dragonmount!

David Funke, the MiserableRainGod, here, establishing my tradition of reporting on Robert Jordan's appearances in New York City. When
*Crossroads of Twilight*
came out, your friendly-neighborhood MiserableRainGod was there with a tape recorder and an ingenious question to ask Mister Jordan. I later typed up a transcript and sent it in to Dragonmount. It can still be found at
[this address](http://web.archive.org/web/20030112090827/http://www.dragonmount.com/Interviews/2003-01-07.aspx)
. Well, today I forgot my tape recorder and didn't prepare any questions to ask Mr. Jordan. I had a pad and pen, though, ready to take some notes for this report. The signing, at a midtown Manhattan Barnes and Noble, would start at 12:30. I got there at 11:50 or so, to get a good seat. At the front door, I was notified that Mr. Jordan would only be signing 2 hardcovers at a time. No surprise there, but I felt a pang of worry over my 2 issues of the
*New Spring*
comic book, which I really, really wanted to get signed.

I went to the front cashier's counter, behind which were a gajillion copies of
*Knife of Dreams*
. I purchased one, and the poor lady behind the counter proceeded to drop it on her toe. A bubble of evil, perhapsâ€”or a moment of clumsiness. It hurt...it's a heavy book. After getting the book in my hands, I went upstairs to where the signing would take place. The B&N bag holding the book (and only the book) broke. Yes, it's that heavy. Double bag, people. Double bag.
