# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#4)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57563364330704897)

Working on a scene that RJ wrote part of. In some ways, those are the toughest ones. Most time consuming, at least.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/57565058963734528)

How much do you usually have to change of RJ's scenes? Just the first part and the last so it fits in well or what?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57565270465720320)

Depends on the scene. If I'm lucky, it's what you explained. But getting my parts to match can be a LOT of work.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57565407317458944)

That's especially true if it's a new character, without a viewpoint narrative I can study except for the unfinished scene.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/BrandSanderson/~6AKfu)

Some of the scenes need more, as they are first drafts RJ intended to revise. I try not to change too much, but some of the scenes were ones where he was careful to lay down important things—like motivation—first, but didn't work on setting very much. (I'm working on one of those now.)

RE: reworking RJ's scenes. Ever get tired and goof? "As Rand reached for the Shardblade..er...
*Callandor*
"...

Ha. No, I haven't done that. Usually when writing WoT I make sure I'm very steeped in reading it at the time.

Scene I worked on yesterday is done.
*A Memory of Light*
is now at 2% done. (Assuming a 300k length, or about the length of
*The Gathering Storm*
.)

#### [DAVID WILSON](http://twitter.com/david2587/status/57928571414528002)

How fast do you expect the % to increase? I'm not badgering, just curious :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57938953365487616)

My goal is 2-3% a week while doing the reread. Then to step it up a bit from there.

#### [FELIX](http://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/57930911865520128)

On a more serious note, which book are up to your #wotrr project?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57939109976616960)

Book five. I've completed two scenes from
*A Memory of Light*
as well.
