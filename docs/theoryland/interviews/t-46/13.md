# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#13)

Today, I've been working on the tactics for the Last Battle, looking to make them as authentic as possible. A lot to keep in mind here.

Do you have a tentative time frame for when
*A Memory of Light*
will be out? Trying to figure out when to start my re-read.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90538362754183168)

Sometime next year. Hard to say specifically; depends on how long Harriet takes to edit.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90538478923812864)

Enough people are asking that I'll go over the
*A Memory of Light*
release timeline again here for you.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90539048099254273)

Goal: Turn in in the first draft November 8th. Following that, editing and revisions. Those are the uncertain part. 3-6 months are likely.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90539284595085312)

So, best case for the book out is March. Worst case is November next year. (Harriet has asked Tor for more time to edit this time.)

Didn't I read somewhere that Robert Jordan already wrote the last chapter?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/90866687913639937)

He did. It's great.
