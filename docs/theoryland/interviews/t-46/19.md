Moving
*A Memory of Light*
's progress bar up 2% to 36%. Expect it to move a tad more slowly this week than last. This patch has less work done on it.

I wonder if it would be too spoilery to post a running count of significant named WoT characters who have died so far in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98596027929595904)

Granted, that count might be 0 so far, so no spoilers yet. I'm just saying... It could be fun to start a count.

(Note, I'm not going to do it. Too spoilery. Just trying to think of things to tweet about the books, as there's so little I can say.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98600156802453505)

How about a non-spoilery Easter egg instead? Each of the three prologues has had at least one complete scene written by RJ before he died.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98600424155779072)

When I split the books, I split the prologue in a way that at least one of those scenes went into each book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98600594079617024)

Prologues were important to RJ, particularly in the later books, and I wanted his stamp to be on each one of the three prologues.

The scene with the Borderland towers in
*Towers of Midnight*
prologue was all RJ correct?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98601448144773120)

Yes. I've confirmed that before. Good eye, if you spotted it on your own.
