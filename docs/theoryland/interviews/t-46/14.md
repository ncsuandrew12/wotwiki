*A Memory of Light*
First Draft progress bar update. 22% -> 24% One quarter is around the corner.

#### [SPEARSISTER](http://twitter.com/spearsister_/status/91288429790363648)

Are there any notes released to the public concerning
*A Memory of Light*
? Please, I hope you get time to write back.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91352374941200385)

By notes, you mean Mr. Jordan's notes? We might release some of them after the book is out. Harriet's call.

#### [MARTIN GJESDAL (15 JULY)](http://twitter.com/mgjesdal/status/91923738282565633)

Is March 2012 still a realistic release date for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91943972204851200)

Very. It will happen almost certainly.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91969564455342080)

Oops. I didn't see the "March" before that. 2012 is certain. March not certain yet.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91969685926576128)

March is probably the earliest it could be out. Latest would be November. It will be Tor and Harriet's call.
