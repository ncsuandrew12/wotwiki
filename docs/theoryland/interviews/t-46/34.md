I find myself thinking "It's been forever since I wrote Perrin. I'll be glad to get back to him." Then I realize his sequence is done.

Note that this isn't because Perrin isn't in the book much. (He is.) It's because I wrote his chapters first.

It is odd, knowing that some characters have had their stories told, that no more will be written about them. You'll feel this next year.
