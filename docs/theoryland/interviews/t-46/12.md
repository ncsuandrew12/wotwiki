Working away at
*A Memory of Light*
. Doing a Rand viewpoint now. (Yes, to contrast
*Towers of Midnight*
, there will many of his direct viewpoints in this one.)

The end of Wheel of Time is very imminent. Next year, if @BrandSanderson is to be believed (I trust him).

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89807577977856000)

Next year for sure. I'm getting close to the 1/3 mark done with the last book. It's moving well.

Work on
*A Memory of Light*
should speed up from here out. I've done a lot of groundwork and outlining. Many scenes are all but finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89821724958400512)

I should be getting done about 1% a day from here out, though that's partially because I haven't yet counted some of that groundwork.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89822205231374336)

For now, I've updated the % bar on my website to 22%, reflecting the 66k words worth of chapters solidly and completely finished.

(Note: that quote is edited for size.) Yes, I'm back to my #wotrr, now that outlining on
*A Memory of Light*
is done, though my focus is still on writing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/89844872164548608)

I now have over 20k of you jokers following me on Twitter. Wonder what % came hoping to see me post a line from
*A Memory of Light*
by accident.
