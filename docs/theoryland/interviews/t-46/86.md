*A Memory of Light*
Update: On page 1500 of 1900 pages in my fourth draft. Still have a few new scenes to add.

Will do one more major draft after this, and then we will move into more line-edit/small tweaks drafts.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213029658004955136)

For those asking, about two manuscript pages become one final hardcover page. (Though it varies.) I'm planning seven or eight drafts total.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213029814829989890)

The drafts of this book have been more extensive than those of the previous two, but we will do fewer of them, probably.

How many offers do you get for volunteer proof readers each day?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035061266751490)

At least one a post. :)

#### [Hyrum Tanner](https://twitter.com/hyrumt/status/213023932813553664)

Is the word count still about 370K or has it increased?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213034928810639360)

It is hard to say, as my draft has lots of Team Jordan comments that are being counted in the final. I think it's 340k right now.

#### [Austin Moore](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/213031214079156224)

So would you say final book will be around 1000 pages or so?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035094905069568)

That's a good estimate.

#### [RJ Chap](https://twitter.com/rj_chap/status/213030971577081857)

Do you ever sell/auction copies of your drafts? Are you allowed?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035155303043073)

I have done it for charity in the past, but never with a WoT book.

#### [Matt Perry](https://twitter.com/MRPerry55/status/213032370603962368)

Still on for The 8th of January? ‪#countingthedays

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/213035015955681280)

Yes.
