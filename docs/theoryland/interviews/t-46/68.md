Are you almost done whatever it is you're doing with
*A Memory of Light*
? Because drawing out the last book is getting crazy.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157900013635239938)

I'm trying to get it revised as quickly as I can. This book is going to need a lot of care to make sure I don't miss anything.

Who has the most POVs? Is it a tie between a couple people?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157967694656839680)

Boy, I haven't counted. Rand/Perrin/Egwene/Mat are all probably about neck and neck.

Well, she IS one of the main characters of the series. It would be kind of odd to leave her out of the Last Battle...

#### [WILL HAGEN](https://twitter.com/_kyte/status/157973622512820224)

Will there be an audiobook release along side the text (with Micheal perhaps)?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974641510584320)

Yes, there should be.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157975534897332224)

Okay, I'm off until later tonight. Progress on the revision is going well; I expect to be done by mid-February, maybe by the end of January.

#### [NICK](https://twitter.com/TheeLostOne/status/158042944870416385)

Is there an official release date for the final book yet? Last I heard was March.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/158057057180860418)

There isn't yet, though it will be fall. Harriet asked for more time to edit, and I needed time to do more research.

#### [JARED OLSEN](https://twitter.com/bigkid1545/status/158007886524588032)

You probably hear this often, but you have done an outstanding job on WOT books. Thank you for honoring Jordan and saving fans. #mistborn

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/158057160679501824)

It has been an honor.
