Sorry for the lack of updates and replies on Facebook/Twitter lately, folks. Been working hard on your book. Seven weeks until my deadline...

Granted, that's a deadline I set for myself, so it can move if I feel it needs to. I'd still like to hit it.
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar moved to 61%.

Some are asking how I get guess the % finished of a book not done. I've been using 300k words as a guess. (As I did for
*Towers of Midnight*
.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/115264655911436288)

Since
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
were both around 300k, and they got me 2/3 through the outline, I think it's a pretty good estimate.
