Interesting. Orbit's new 'Turn the Wheel of Time' promo thing seems adamant that
*A Memory of Light*
will be November 2012.

I thought that was still up in the air and an earlier release was possible (especially if @BrandSanderson delivers by Jan 2012).

The date hasn't been picked yet, so theoretically anything next year is possible.

However, realistically, I doubt Tor will pass up the holiday season for the last WoT book. Or at least the summer season.

While they COULD pick spring, it wouldn't make much sense marketing wise, and I think Harriet wants a good six months to edit.

That means July is the earliest, November the latest, we will see the book. I'd put my money on somewhere in-between.
