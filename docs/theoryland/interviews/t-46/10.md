Read three Mistborn books in three days. @BrandSanderson must have a magic pen.

Unfortunately, that pen runs on the tortured screams of Wheel of Time readers waiting for their final book...

Updated
*A Memory of Light*
finished status to 12%. Sitting in my hotel and writing after something like six media interviews in London today.

Do we have an approximate date for publication? I need to start my re-read to get ready :-)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/76749480321490944)

Next year sometime. Latest: November. Earliest: March. More likely later than earlier.

Quick question :) What happened to
*A Memory of Light*
coming out this November? Your original post explaining the split says November.

I assume it was too much work and I am cool with that. I am just wondering. Did I miss a blog post explaining the change? Thanks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/88751691142406144)

There have been a couple of blog posts. Basically, it just wasn't feasible.

Harriet asked for more time for editing; she was feeling rushed. I also needed more time.
