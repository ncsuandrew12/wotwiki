Sometimes, it feels like cheating to have Alan and Maria (Robert Jordan's assistants) to look things up for me on these books.

For example, Alan is a military history buff, and has been my personal "Great Captain" for
*A Memory of Light*
, giving valuable advice on tactics.

Finished a really awesome scene today, and started one that turned out meh. I'll have to rework that one come this evening.

Not counting that scene, but counting the awesome one,
*A Memory of Light*
is at 52% done now.

52%? That's great! I'm wondering though how did you come up with that number?

#### [JOHN UNDERWOOD](http://twitter.com/Zod1966/status/111618002260197376)

Do you have a specific number of pages in mind to finish the book?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/111632646634868736)

I've used 300k words as a rough estimate for each of these books for getting the % bar.
