Last draft of
*A Memory of Light*
needs to be done soon. For today, I'm polishing off the last two new Rand scenes (of about eight) I'm adding to the book.

Any news on WoT? Know you're sick of that question. Sorry... :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/222979744109572096)

Well, other than the last Rand scene (which I'm writing right now) not much. Need to finish the final draft as soon as possible.

Comic-conning for the night done. (Had dinner with a Hollywood producer.) Now, for some more WoT editing!

You know, it IS okay to rest and play once in a while!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223680997835800576)

Ha. Not when we're past deadline on this book. I'll rest when it's done.

Working on
*A Memory of Light*
's final draft?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223681023555272705)

Yup.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223743623861256193)

All right, WoT editing for the day done. This is going really well—the book is very nearly done. Just polishing, now.
