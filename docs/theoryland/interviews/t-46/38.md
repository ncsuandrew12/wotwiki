You recently said you were just over 60% finished with
*A Memory of Light*
; how much % will RJ's ending take up when you put it in?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/117314077977616384)

I'm guessing about 10%.

Is it gonna get slid right in or are you going to adjust it some to fit into how you're leading up to it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/117320851791151104)

The ending scene will work fine, no changes. I've targeted things that way, as I didn't want the ending scene to change.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/117321007764750336)

However, he left a TON of 'after the end scene' type stuff that is probably epilogue material. That I'll need to modify.
