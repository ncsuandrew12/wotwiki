# [Interview #46, Entry #75]: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#75)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (10 March 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178623127310446592)

I've been thinking lately of ways to give away digital copies of my books when you buy a hardcover. There are some issues with this.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178623399168458752)

I don't know much about the logistics; it may be impossible. If there is a way to make this work, I'd propose it to Tor and Harriet for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178623641943162882)

Here's a
[reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qqlb2/marvel_comics_now_offering_free_ecomic_with/)
where I mention issues with the process. Weigh in here or in that thread to give me advice.

#### [SABERJ](https://twitter.com/Saberj/status/178623788211122176)

The only way I could think of would be to include one-time use codes with the books. But what's to stop people from selling?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624295004667905)

Yeah. The other problem with that is securing the code. Books aren't wrapped up, so the code could be scratched off/stolen easily.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624716515454976)

My preferred method would be to put a code in a book that, then, you can redeem for free or a small price. But how do we secure it?

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178628034377695234)

You don't. Your stuff is already being pirated and publishers shouldn't consider those lost sales. Trust people a la Apple.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628321821732865)

I'm not worried about piracy. However, a digital code that can be used many times seems foolish. A one-use would be stolen.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628434900172800)

One use has to be secured, or the person buying the book is in danger of being ripped off.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628628656046080)

Multi-use means that we're hosting the book, and paying the bandwidth, for those who want to pirate. Bad idea, I think.

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178628854628368385)

I'll host it for you. :) No charge.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629076897103872)

Lol. One other problem is that this needs to be reasonable enough to the publisher's ears to get them to go along.

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178629468879994880)

My point exactly. Big Pub doesn't get the new model. They consider pirated copies as lost sales. See Seth Godin for new model.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629706617339904)

The publishers aren't as ignorant as you think. The investors, however, are another story. (You're right about them.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629799667965954)

Tor has done plenty of giving away free, DRM-free ebooks. They did it with Mistborn, for example.

#### [NIC JOHNSON](https://twitter.com/nicjohnson/status/178629953749921793)

Ah! To me as an outsider they are one and the same. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178630282365243392)

Publishers and editors in sf/f tend to be techies. Notice that Cory Doctorow, with Tor's blessing, releases all of his books for free.

#### [SABERJ](https://twitter.com/Saberj/status/178624667714719745)

How is Marvel doing it? They don't tend to wrap Comics either.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624862858911747)

I think you order directly from them, and they send you the comic and deliver through their own secure app.

#### [ANNE BURNER](https://twitter.com/anneburner/status/178624589826506753)

*Baen*
used to put a CD copy of the book inside the hardcover versions of @davidweber1 Honor Harrington books.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178624996577513472)

I asked if we could do that, and the answer was that it was expensive enough it couldn't become the standard.

#### [WES QUINT](https://twitter.com/doubleewe/status/178625066878251008)

Maybe like a gift card where it's only active after purchase?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178625255101837313)

Yeah, this is probably the best idea. I don't know how hard that is to accomplish, though.

#### [SABERJ](https://twitter.com/Saberj/status/178625686418882561)

A lot of textbooks used to include a disc in the book for additional material. Discs are a bit harder to steal than codes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626034151854080)

Textbooks also have a much larger profit margin than novels. I asked about discs for my last book, and the publisher said no.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626118004383745)

They said it was just too expensive.

#### [BENJYMOUS](https://twitter.com/benjymous/status/178625646640119809)

Old school tech, I know, but how about a coupon you have to fill in with your email address then post back to the publisher?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626290801328130)

Ha. You know, I never thought about that. The problem is, how do we keep people from stealing them out of the books?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626364897898496)

People with a nice hardcover don't want to cut their book apart to get a coupon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626659275128834)

Here are a couple of problems with what people are suggesting. 1) We don't want to shrink wrap books, but a code can be stolen very easily.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626857044946944)

Anything involving the retailer verifying a code, or printing one out, requires large-scale involvement of retailers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178626950540173312)

That's not something I can change. They may be working on this already. I want something I could take to Tor, that we could do in house.

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/178626683736309760)

Or if you're talking about securing the code in the book...it seems easy enough with textbooks. Peel-off? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627144837111810)

People would walk into the store, peel off the sticker, write down the code, then sell it or use it.

#### [BRAD LICKMAN](https://twitter.com/brad_lickman/status/178626571484135424)

How do you stop people from sharing a hardcover copy?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627305273425920)

The physical product can be made to set off an alarm. A code can be copied and carried out.

#### [ANDREW YAGER](https://twitter.com/andrewyager/status/178627233294983168)

Could codes be single use? That would largely get around the securing problem?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627499037696001)

People would walk into the store, write down the code, go home and download the book.

#### [KYLE](https://twitter.com/Drantis82/status/178627343814893568)

What about one-time scratch codes like what's used on gift cards?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627691463966720)

Those are usually activated by the retailer. I'd love for us to be able to do that, but it would involve more than I can do.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178627934729404417)

Another issue with this is that if I did it, I would need it to work for indy booksellers and not just Amazon/Barnes & Noble.

#### [BRAD LICKMAN](https://twitter.com/brad_lickman/status/178628594149494784)

Can you sell the digital copy at http://tor.com, which provides a coupon for the hardcover?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628775460868097)

This is actually what I proposed to Tor a few years back, and they said they didn't want to offend the retailers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178628829185716224)

I still like the idea, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178629564552056832)

I won't have time to reply to everyone here, but keep sending thoughts. I'll read and see if I can come up with something to take to Tor.

#### [BEN FOXWORTHY](https://twitter.com/BenFoxworthy/status/178629545014988800)

How about this: Put the code in the book. Don't secure it. Each code works three times. Hope people don't abuse it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/178630022960123904)

That risks punishing the person who buys the book (but their code has been stolen and used.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 MARCH)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/179073002024087552)

More on the
*A Memory of Light*
ebook thing. What would you guys think if I tried to talk Tor into a 'special edition' release.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/179073183037661185)

A kind of 'boxed set' that came with hardcover, ebook, audiobook, a medallion or other keepsake, and maybe some interviews with me & Harriet.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/179073695606779904)

Shrink wrapped & sold at bookstores for, say, $50 instead of $30? Does that get too far away from the 'free ebook w/the hardcover' concept?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/179073875416588288)

It does seem to defeat the purpose, as far as most people would be concerned. Though many would buy it.

#### [DAVE PUTNAM (22 MARCH)](https://twitter.com/dputanm/status/182871674331471872)

*A Memory of Light*
e-book release announced with three month gap. Can you explain the rationale behind this? Lot of vitriol on Tor site.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182908038942961664)

Harriet worries, among other things, at the impact on the bestseller lists by releasing at the same time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182908157205561344)

Ebooks make her uncomfortable.

#### [FYODOR](https://twitter.com/Fyodor32768/status/182886177156759552)

Making us wait three three months for the
*A Memory of Light*
ebook is very obnoxious and shows contempt for the fan base. I have been reading...

#### [FYODOR](https://twitter.com/Fyodor32768/status/182886495093391362)

...WOT since 1992 and deeply resent this type of staggering.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182907521831419906)

I've been working on it. The delay is not Tor, but Harriet, who worries at the implications of releasing an ebook immediately.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/182907636247826432)

She originally wanted a six month, or longer, delay. I was able to persuade her to move to three months.
