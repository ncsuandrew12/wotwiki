# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#20)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (3 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98845542016221184)

I'm currently writing "Through Lines" on
*A Memory of Light*
, meaning I'm taking one character or group and going beginning to end.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98845983827443712)

I'll end up writing the ending a number of times through different eyes, each separated by a short book's number of pages. Odd experience.

#### [CHRISTOPHER SKINNER](http://twitter.com/MaverickTempest/status/98846355631517696)

How do you do that without diminishing the impact of the "big finish" (I mean there's denouement anyway, but the climax)?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98848107529375744)

Careful planning, followed by a lot of reads-through of the entire book to smooth and enhance.

#### [NEIL MCKINNON](http://twitter.com/mc_neeze/status/98848358889816065)

Did you do that with Rand/Egwene in
*The Gathering Storm*
and Mat/Perrin
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98849087780171776)

Yes, I did.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98862718035038208)

At about 20 scenes and 50k words, the first "Through Line" of
*A Memory of Light*
is done. I can't tell you who it is, but I'm very pleased.

#### [ERIC PETERS](http://twitter.com/ericpeters/status/98863975541907457)

Why wouldn't you be able to tell us who it is? Is it a real secret who all of the characters in the book are at this point?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98865440914276352)

Some people don't want any kind of spoiler. Knowing there are 50k words of someone means they don't die at the start.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98866710727245824)

If you look back through my Twitter feed, you can figure out who it is. [It was Perrin.] I might do a blog post on it too, with a spoiler warning.

#### [SHARON VERNON](http://twitter.com/rgoddes/status/98849712920215552)

Do you find it easier to write "through lines" and then tie it all up together later?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/98863061833760768)

For a very big, complex book, it's basically the only way I can do it. Otherwise, I lose character voices.

#### [FRANK KWIATOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/98954093627838464)

Is this your style, or how RJ wanted it? Just curious.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (4 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007615199232000)

What specifically are you asking about? The writing of "Through Lines?"

#### [FRANK KWIATOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/99019813166383104)

You mentioned writing the same ending multiple times. I'm taking it as the same ending being reviewed from different POVs?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99033092131536896)

Different pieces of what, together, will be the ending sequences of the book.

#### [CONNOR EVERINGHAM](http://twitter.com/Connor_e/status/98921317084049408)

I'm guessing that with one through line at 50k words,
*A Memory of Light*
will be a massive book?Will chunks be taken out during editing?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007811958222848)

I always edit down, rather than up. I overwrite intentionally on first drafts. But the book will be big.

#### [PHIL](http://twitter.com/e_chemyst/status/98915868834140160)

I might just be ignorant here, but what's a "Through Line"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99007995018620929)

Where you write one character's parts, all the way through the book.
