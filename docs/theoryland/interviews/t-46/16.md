Just updated the % bar on
*A Memory of Light*
from 24% to 27% to reflect this week's work so far. A lot of travel this week, with ComicCon, slowed me down.

Just got
*Elantris*
and
*Warbreaker*
at Waldenbooks' liquidation.

Sweet. Nice score. I once got all of King's Black Tower at a similar deal.

Ha. Just looked at my last tweet, which was a direct reply to someone, and realized a mistake I made. Gives a clue what I'm working on...

#### Footnote

King's series is called "The Dark Tower".
