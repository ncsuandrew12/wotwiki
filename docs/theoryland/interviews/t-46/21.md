Still working on
*A Memory of Light*
. That deadline (which is self-imposed, but still important to me) of November is starting to loom.

Blarg. This scene is just way too bland for the level of awesomeness it is supposed to include. Scrapping it.

#### [JD](http://twitter.com/johnjosephTX/status/99030331931365376)

How many words did you scrap? And how much time was invested?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99032717865385984)

Maybe three hours worth of writing. Not that much. 1500 words, perhaps?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99038895076937728)

New scene has more kick to it, I'm pleased to report.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (5 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/99596325204656128)

One more short scene just added to the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue. It needs one more, but I haven't decided which one yet.
