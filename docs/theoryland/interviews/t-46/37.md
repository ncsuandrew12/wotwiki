Pandora's playing a LDS children's song: 1) This does NOT fit the Last Battle. 2) How's it know I'm Mormon? It's a Tangerine Dream station.

It's now playing Michael Buble. Somewhere in my thumbs-upping, I may have deviated from the station's electronica theme just a tad...

I'm going to inject Pink Floyd into the station to shake it up. By the way, I listened to Pulse again this week. Man, that album is awesome.

Some of the most fun I get to have comes when Mat describes someone in his head. (Can't match RJ at doing so, but it's still fun.)
