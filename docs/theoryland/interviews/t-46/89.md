How about an update on when
*A Memory of Light*
will be published?

Still January 8th, so far as I know. One more draft to do.

When the WoT is done, are you planning to write anything about the process of adapting RJ's work, like a Special Feature?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/221344345796788224)

I would like to, but no promises.

This is tragic, on the final draft and we still can't get the book by October or November!

Well, when you count copyedit, proofreads, and printing time, it is still going to be tight.
