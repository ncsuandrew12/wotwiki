Working away at
*A Memory of Light*
last draft. 80 pages remaining, and I'll be done. Probably will finish tonight.

Last draft is done, folks. From here, we head to copyedits. (And perhaps small tweaks here and there.) Basically, though,
*A Memory of Light*
is finished.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/229165479531515904)

Thanks for the good wishes, all. Final length of the book is around 360k words.
*Towers of Midnight*
was 335k, for reference.

Congratulations, Brandon. Most cool.

Thanks! I'll tell you, I barely know what month it is, let alone what day... This has been a grueling set of revisions.

Do we know if January 8th is the official
*A Memory of Light*
release or the date could still change?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/229179755235270656)

Probably not going to change at this point.

Out tonight with Emily enjoying a celebratory steak for having finished the Wheel of Time. Five years of work, hard but satisfying.
