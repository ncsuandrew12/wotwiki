Is the long wait for
*A Memory of Light*
so it can make more sense than
*Towers of Midnight*
? I LOVE WoT, but
*Towers of Midnight*
was jumbled and super annoying.

I don't mean to sound the jerk, but character and time references felt disjointed and it was hard to follow.

*The Gathering Storm*
worked well. I never felt confused or bothered. Some revelations came off as "too sudden", but it flowed nicely.

*Towers of Midnight*
had none of the smoothness of the previous books, and stumbled from poor integration with
*The Gathering Storm*
.

What you're noticing has to do with two primary issues, I believe.

First, the book getting split in half after I'd written much of it to go together. (I hadn't written any of the third then.)

Second, RJ had been letting people get off timeline with one another for books and books. Bringing them back together was hard.
