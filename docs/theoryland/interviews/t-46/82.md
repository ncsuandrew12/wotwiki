WoT update: Today, I added a new Rand scene to the book. One of many I've been working on, but this one came together first.

? Is it a complete NEW scene? If so is it because the editors thought it would fit into the book more, is this the second draft?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204705709017923585)

New scene. We often add new scenes in the second, third, or even last drafts of a book.

Feel free to add as much as the binding will allow!! Thanks for everything! By the way do you have an updated word count estimate?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204728834698915840)

No updated count yet. We'll see how much more I add this time around—I'm cutting it too.

Can/Will you tell us anything about it? Please? :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204728953326407680)

I'm afraid I can't say much. I try to be extra-careful with WoT scenes out of respect for Harriet.

When is the last book being published? I can't believe it's the end of the series already.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204704908828606464)

January.
