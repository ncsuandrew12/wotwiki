#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119879076805750784)

FINALLY done with the through line I've been working on for weeks now. Progress bar moved to 70% done.

When can we expect it??? What do you think?? #reallyreallycan'twait!!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119892881136828416)

Sometime next year. I suspect they'll set a date when I give them the first draft in November.

Now, to fire a
[gun that has been sitting on the mantle](http://t.co/OmaV8PAQ)
since the middle (chapters 30-40) of book 3.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119897191996338176)

Now THAT is a good clue. (The Mat one was not incredibly surprising, but this one will be fun.)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119898362693697536)

Want to

@BrandSanderson's latest
*A Memory of Light*
clue? It's a good one!

Thanks @Terez27.

#### [BEN KLUGE](http://twitter.com/benkluge/status/119905014503313408)

Has anyone got close yet:) ?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119905243382288385)

Pfft, we've barely started yet.

#### [BEN KLUGE](http://twitter.com/benkluge/status/119905482642173952)

I know—but once we have got started the odds of possibly getting an answer drop from very low to zero.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119906702400290816)

Ha. I already flirt with giving away too much. I doubt you'll pull anything more from me for a while.

#### [4TH AGE](http://twitter.com/4thAge/status/119906698793201664)

I'm sure with how conscious you are of us examining your every word you checked, so are you SURE it's in those chapters?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/119908557138300928)

99% sure.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119959569144360961)

Would you at least confirm you're not talking about 13-13? You referenced that as a Chekhov's Gun before
*Towers of Midnight*
...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119959691118915584)

...and so the association is hard to shake. But it was introduced in
*The Dragon Reborn*
22 and of course already showed up in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/119959900897021952)

And technically, you
*could*
be referring to that since we didn't actually see the turning. And 99%. :( ... ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (5 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121472468404809728)

Mat is so much fun to write. The trick, which is hard, is to get the right mix of humor & awesome. One without the other just isn't Mat.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/121476468579647488)

Ahh, confirmation. And good luck with Mat. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121479165122842624)

Not sure what I'm confirming, but okay. On the thing I tweeted before, it's obviously NOT 13x13. It is cool, but smaller than that.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/121480083121778688)

Cool. I was talking about the fact that you were working on Mat's 'through line'. I had assumed you were. Smaller? Hmm.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

In retrospect I'm not so sure he was working on Mat's through line because in the previous one, he specified he was writing Mat's thoughts.
