Back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. I have two early sequences I left half-finished because I felt I needed to lay down more important sequences first.

Still working on those smaller, early-book sequences I mentioned . This one involves a character who had his first viewpoint in
*Towers of Midnight*
.
