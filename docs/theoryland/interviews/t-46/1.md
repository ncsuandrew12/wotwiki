And lo, 1% of
*A Memory of Light*
done, as per my website progress bar. My reading's been slow this last month, but I made up for it by working on a scene.

Here! A (kind of) screenshot of the beginning of the end of the Wheel of Time.

For those asking: Yes, I write in courier. I apprenticed as a writer during an era where it was still the standard among the old guard.

I also underline instead of italicize, use "--" instead of an emdash, and have habits relating to other old-school typesetting artifacts.

Will you hold a new charity contest for
*A Memory of Light*
, but this time for Trolloc/Dreadlord/Darkfriend names? We think you should.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46694903945764864)

I WILL hold a new contest like that. Likely to help fund Jordancon.

People are asking about the files in the picture I posted on Saturday. The one that says "Alan Outline NEW" references Alan, RJ's assistant.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/47415214072803328)

Alan is a member of "Team Jordan" and was the one who compiled the original outline for
*A Memory of Light*
using all of the files and scenes RJ had.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/47415498043953152)

I have taken it and changed things around a lot, added to it, and it has evolved over the years. But it is the
*Memory of Light*
outline.
