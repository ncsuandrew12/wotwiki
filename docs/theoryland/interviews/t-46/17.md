By the way,
*A Memory of Light*
% done has moved from 27% -> 30%. Expect sharp rises this week; I hit a patch where I've already done a lot of work.

Final WHEEL OF TIME novel approaching a third-done? Impressive. Probably too much to hope we'll get it earlier than Nov 12?

It's really going to depend on Harriet, Adam. My goal is to turn it in before I go on tour November.

From there, we'll go to revisions. Harriet has asked for more time to edit this one. (She worries the last had too many mistakes.)

I love working on Perrin's scenes. I can't really explain why, but the two of us have always clicked.

6k words of material for
*A Memory of Light*
(some worked on previously) added to the main storyline. 2% more done, bringing us to 32%.
