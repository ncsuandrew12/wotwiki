I have three more major 'Through Lines' for this book, then some spot fill-ins of smaller characters. After that, some work on the climax.

The ending will actually be the easiest part of this book for me, as RJ wrote large chunks of it himself.

So while it may look like I'm not far enough along to be finished in November, the last 10% or so will jump forward very quickly.

But you
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#4)
those were the most time-consuming parts for you. :s

Scenes he half finished are very tough. Scenes he totally finished are easy.

This is the final edit before going to print then? Or one more go-through after this?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/113397274859679745)

This is just the first draft, I'm afraid.
