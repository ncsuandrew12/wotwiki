# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#32)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (10 September 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112627777064280064)

Finished another "Through Line" of
*A Memory of Light*
. This one turned out really, really well. I'm kind of surprised, honestly.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112628078953496576)

This is a character I think many readers are less excited about, but the story here is very powerful. I'm pleased.

#### [HARSH AGARWAL](http://twitter.com/H4R5Hagarwal/status/112616727841484800)

When can we expect the last book to be released?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112628269119062017)

Next year sometime. Spring at the earliest (I don't think it's likely) fall at the latest.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112629726320922624)

Nice big jump in the progress bar today as I pull a few things I'd already been working on and place them in the book. 52% -> 56%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112630188612911105)

For those curious, I've been timing lately and looking at my historical wordcounts (I often keep lists of daily progress.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112630457107095552)

Writing a given amount of words on the Wheel of Time takes about twice as long as it does when working on non-WoT books.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112630743808737280)

I think this is due to: 1) The complexity of working in such a long series. 2) Making sure character voices match those in RJ's writing.

#### [TERRY SIMPSON](http://twitter.com/TeeSimps/status/112631869182443520)

Which character voice have you found it hardest to duplicate? And has that difficulty stayed consistent for each book?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112637452073701376)

Mat. Yes, he has always been the toughest.

#### [CAITLIN GRANT](http://twitter.com/CGrant4/status/112644143318183936)

Love knowing progress but just remembered Tor will likely delay e-release. #frustration

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112647481149505536)

Not Tor, actually. Harriet. I'm working on her, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112647606697603072)

The delay last time was because
*The New York Times*
didn't count ebook sales for bestseller lists.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112647957337223168)

A lot of people are asking about the release date for
*A Memory of Light*
, so I'll talk about it again. I just couldn't get it out for this November.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112648292525023232)

My new rough-draft goal is November, with a revised book sent to Harriet January 1st. Book could be out any time between March (unlikely) and November.

#### [OSKAR KOIVUJUURI](http://twitter.com/OskarKAwesome/status/112648793429778433)

This November? I thought it was always supposed to be released March of next year? Oh well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/112649755741523968)

I was hoping March. It's theoretically possible...but Harriet thinks not. She wants more time to edit than she had for
*Towers of Midnight*
.
