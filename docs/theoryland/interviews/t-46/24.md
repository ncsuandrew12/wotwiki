Okay, back from WorldCon and (mostly) recovered. Back to work on

Blarg. This chapter and viewpoint isn't working. Going to try Thom for a bit instead. Need to be inspired by a storyteller.

So are you saying Thom is still alive? Good to know:)

Well, he starts the book alive. I'll say that. Who knows where in the book this scene will go?

How far through writing that book are you?
