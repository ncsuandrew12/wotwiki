Okay,
*A Memory of Light*
is going fine..the book is awesome, but it feels like I've been working on it FOREVER. I need some motivation, so...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144916293571715072)

I'm going to start doing what I did last year. If I hit my wordcounts, I will open a pack of Magic cards as a reward. Yes, I'm a nerd.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144921913116999680)

People are asking how close the draft is to being done. Close, but I keep realizing there are points that need expanding.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144927389334503424)

Current length of
*A Memory of Light*
: 313,000 words.
*Towers of Midnight*
—the longest of the two I've done so far—was 335k.
*A Memory of Light*
will be at least that long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144927533715042305)

It WILL come out next year, and will not be split again. I'm close to the end, but still have several weeks worth of hard work to do.

#### [SKYLA GRIMES](http://twitter.com/skylatron/status/144927754855526400)

Is there a word-count length that you are encouraged not to exceed?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144927893972201472)

Over 400k would really be pushing it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144928342368464896)

And, as 5:00 rolls around, I have managed (barely) to hit my 2k wordcount goal so far today. Time for a Magic pack!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144928737408978944)

This one was sent to be by a fan, via my Amazon wishlist. (No name was included.) Whoever you are, thanks! The rare is:

#### [LOCAL VIEWER](http://twitter.com/greg5x5/status/144929049272258561)

Is the infamous last scene Robert Jordan left behind already part of the 313,000 words?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144930425096241152)

No, it is not. So the 'finished' length is actually longer. I haven't put that chunk in yet.

#### [JEFF](http://twitter.com/swordwraith/status/144928558140235776)

Is your average word count goal/day usually 2k?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144930614175465472)

On a WoT novel, which is much harder, that is a fair count. On something simpler, 3-4k is average.

#### [DONAGH MARNANE](http://twitter.com/enanram/status/144930100012515329)

I'm just wondering why you have a daily wordcount—surely the quality is more important than the length?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144930902319964160)

I believe that daily goals are important, as crafting a great book requires work as much as it does inspiration.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144931005143326720)

Laying down a rough first draft, then polishing over and over, is the path I've found to creating excellent work.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/144930899853713408)

Have you written through the ending for all the main characters? If so, is the rest just "expanding" scenes out?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144931074995257346)

Not all of them yet. Just a few.

#### [ROBYN ESTERBIZZLE](http://twitter.com/rzester/status/144973327470047232)

You are working on the final book in an epic series that people have been reading for decades and you need a game for motivation?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144978255479455744)

Even when you love what you do, it can be hard to work 12 hour days to finish a book after an exhausting tour.
