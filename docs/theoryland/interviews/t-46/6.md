Note that I have a few percentage points to add to the progress bars on my website; we have to wait for the site to be fixed first, though.

Please do tell how many percentage points were added! Are you still doing #wotrr?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/66424901401186304)
