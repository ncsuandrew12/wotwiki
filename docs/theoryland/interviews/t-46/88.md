I just sent my complete revision of
*A Memory of Light*
to Harriet. This is the fourth draft, and was every extensive a revision.

Drafts of this book so far have been more in-depth than on
*Towers of Midnight*
or
*The Gathering Storm*
. I suspect we'll do seven or eight drafts total of this book.

Are you trying to hint at a 2015 release date now? Because now I'm picturing Doc Brown with the book in the Delorean. >\_<

No, we'll have it done and ready for January.
