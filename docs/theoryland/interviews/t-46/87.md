*A Memory of Light*
teaser: The book contains a new verse to a beloved WoT song. (Just posting to let you all know the revision goes well.)

Do you revise sections that Mr Jordan wrote, or just your own? No implication, just curious. :-)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/215163884896649218)

It's a good question. I initially tried to leave them all alone and let Harriet revise them.

She told me to be more aggressive in smoothing out scenes to blend them together. I still do try to touch his as little as I can.

First tweet to you, but I wanted to say I'm so very excited for
*A Memory of Light*
! Can we change the release to January 7th? That's my birthday!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/215163614116593664)

I'll see what I can do... ;)

#### Footnote

The song is probably "Jak o' the Shadows".
