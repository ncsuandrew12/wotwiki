Back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. May be the day to reveal a side-character's long-hidden motivations .

Do we get a clue as to whom this character is?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145228240993267712)

If I told you that, you'd be expecting it. I'm afraid it is a RAFO. This character HAS been a little suspicious.

Mr. @BrandSanderson please stop teasing
*A Memory of Light*
.

Sorry. Some people really want to watch the progress, and so I try to keep the posts as spoiler-free as possible.

This afternoon's "Brandon opens Magic cards as he writes" comes sponsored by Sarah Bartram, who sent the cards off my wishlist. Thanks!

The rare was this card (which is sweet, since I like zombie cards):

Just wrote a scene with Bela in it.

This scene is one that RJ left instruction for in his notes; it gave me shivers when reading.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/145289584618647552)

Okay, that scene's done, and it is beyond awesome. Over 3k done; opening another pack sent by Sarah B. ...Mythic rare!
