Oh, bureaucracy, you are my bane. It always takes me like five minutes to figure out how to spell that word...

Other fun things from Brandon's spelling mind: I always want to write Darlin Sisnera's name "Darlin Sinestro." Crossover time!

Don't even get me started on
*algai'd'siswai*
and
*siswai'aman*
, by the way.

Just updated the % for
*A Memory of Light*
draft two to 70%. Should have the whole book done and off to Harriet in a week or so.

Hi Brandon. What's the official release date for the final Wheel of Time novel? Can't wait!!!!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167327582101057536)

I don't think there is one yet. Fall, sometime, probably. But Harriet is the one who will decide.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167329980257271809)

A lot of people ask after the release date. Fall/Winter this year is still likely. However, I would like to note that Harriet is in charge.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167330096628244480)

She hasn't yet read the entire book; she gets to decide when it will be released. She can delay it or push it up, whatever she wants.
