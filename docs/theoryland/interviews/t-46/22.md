I moved the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up one more point, to 38%. Slow going this week. Head cold + lots of pre-writing to do + sister's wedding.

Will
*A Memory of Light*
actually be the last book? or do you think you will split it up again? Are you thinking of 2012 release?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/101770127732785152)

It will not be split. I'm pretty certain. 2012 for sure.

Hi Brandon! Any guesstimations on when we might see
*A Memory of Light*
cover art? Thanks!

I was just asking Tor about this, actually. I think it's a little ways off. Maybe first of next year.
