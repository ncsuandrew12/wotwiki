Next year sometime.

To those asking, I'm not going to tell you where the wind rose, folks. It's the very last of them. I can't spoil something like that.

Slowly working through some things on
*A Memory of Light*
. There are some tough things I need to get right, though I can't say more.

Percentage meter on my website is still down. Just tried to update
*A Memory of Light*
and blanked things. We're at about 5%, though.
