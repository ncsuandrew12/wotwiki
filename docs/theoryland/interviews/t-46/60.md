Just finished
[a scene](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#16)
in
*A Memory of Light*
that ranks among the most visually powerful I've ever done. I REALLY want to see this one in film form.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146680787004166144)

A lot of questions about the WoT film rights. Universal has the rights. Maybe I should have phrased my last tweet as...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146681005657436160)

"Dear Universal, please do a good job on the first WoT movie, because you really, REALLY need to get to book 14 and do this scene."

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146705260990316545)

I don't know how far off the WoT film is. The screenwriters produced a new draft of the script a few weeks back. I have not read it.

#### [Selene O'Rourke](http://twitter.com/LenaOR/status/146708426255372288)

I would love to see a Wheel of Time movie series or TV miniseries. Has anyone optioned that you can mention?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146708565304938496)

Universal has the rights. Not an option, but a full buy-out.

#### [Muaz Zekeria](http://twitter.com/DukeSugaJones/status/146730339224649728)

Just out of curiosity would you prefer WoT to be a film series or a TV series a la
*Game of Thrones*
? Also keep up the great work.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733003635310593)

I would prefer television.

#### [Killer Bob](http://twitter.com/killer_bob_/status/146726816143523841)

Do you know if the film is going to be super-long like the
*Lord of the Rings*
movies, split in parts like Harry Potter or something ...

#### [Killer Bob](http://twitter.com/killer_bob_/status/146727181056344064)

...else? Also, thank you for finishing WoT! I really, really like the books you've written, they're excellent!

#### [Killer Bob](http://twitter.com/killer_bob_/status/146727466663284736)

By that I mean the WoT books. I like the other books too (especially Mistborn), but not as much as WoT.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733147873214464)

Thanks for reading! The plan now is one film that covers
*Eye of the World*
, and will be somewhat long.

#### [Chase Emory](http://twitter.com/ChaseEmory/status/146716321390931969)

I don't understand why you wouldn't be working integrally with the screenwriter, I hope they realize that this isn't a movie...

#### [Chase Emory](http://twitter.com/ChaseEmory/status/146716568821317632)

...that they can just pump out. They need to do an amazing job or not waste their time.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733415176220673)

I'm hoping they will let me comment on the screenplay, but so far, I've been kind of busy with
*A Memory of Light*
...

#### [Nate Rios](http://twitter.com/nathantrios/status/146740728251432961)

I haven't read WOT but these
*A Memory of Light*
Tweets are making me want to check it out! I've not read any of Jordan's work. Thoughts?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146741080493273088)

I love the WoT, and have for many years. It is a long journey, however, so be warned.

#### [Christopher](http://twitter.com/cdav82/status/146345384896237568)

When is
*A Memory of Light*
out; I thought January, but I've heard its been put back?

#### [Shaun Duquette](http://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/146472896162836480)

Gah,this is unacceptable!! You've already delayed this once!!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146817866090561536)

Not much I can do, I'm afraid. I'm turning it in on time; the date is being set by the publisher.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146732933921767424)

Okay, that scene is done. Now I have a few quick, one-shot viewpoints to do. People you may not expect.

#### [Josh Hlibichuk](http://twitter.com/qrevolution/status/146733192353808384)

Do we get a Dark One PoV? Is that question an auto-RAFO?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146737032172015617)

RAFO, of course. :)
