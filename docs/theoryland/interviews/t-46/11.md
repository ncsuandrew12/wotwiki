Just revised the percentage bar for
*A Memory of Light*
, bumping it up to 20% finished to reflect the work I've done in the last few weeks.

Back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. I can get in a few more hours tonight.

Please finish
*A Memory of Light*
and I'll buy
*The Way of Kings*
... Yeah, I'm late, so be it!

Ha. Consider that a deal. (Of course, I was going to finish
*A Memory of Light*
anyway...) :)
