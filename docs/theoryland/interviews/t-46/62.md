# [Interview #46, Entry #62]: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#62)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (15 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147392541782835200)

Scene I'm working on needs to be trashed and rewritten from a different viewpoint. Ah, well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147429223466930176)

Okay, the scene is working much better now. Basically, a half-day lost, but it is worth backing up if something isn't working.

#### [JOE LAVOIE](http://twitter.com/lavoiejh/status/147431953774284800)

When you say a scene isn't "working" what does that mean? Bad mojo, doesn't feel right, or its there a technical reason?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147433574637912065)

All three, actually. Mostly, it just feels wrong.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147447042556432384)

And it is fixed now. Hard to judge my wordcount today, since I spent time fixing, but I'm opening a pack of Magic cards as a reward.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147448464375156736)

Current length of
*A Memory of Light*
: 335,000 words, same size as
*Towers of Midnight*
. And I haven't finished yet, nor have I added in RJ's ending.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147448653332742145)

Even with edits, this will be the longest of the three WoT books I've done. Don't worry about it being split, though. That won't happen.

#### [DANIEL ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/Sp00nyDan/status/147449491623129088)

Is RJ's ending ready for primetime? Or do you have an outline of how it is supposed to go?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147450009732915203)

I should be able to put it in without changing anything other than a quick smoothing of the language.

#### [SISTER INFANT](http://twitter.com/SinisterInfant/status/147449172252033024)

Will there be any indication in the book as to when RJ's ending starts? Like a footnote from you or Harriet or something?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147450126074511360)

No, but I will tell you once the book is out, after you've read it.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/147456267747733504)

Hello! Just wondering, was the Borderland Tower sequence in
*Towers of Midnight*
(with Malenarin Rai) originally part of RJ's prologue?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147457148769665025)

He wrote most of that scene himself, actually.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/147463519762268160)

Cool! Are you allowed to say whether it was part of his prologue (which I gather you split and distributed over
*The Gathering Storm*
/
*Towers of Midnight*
)?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147464862526746624)

Yes, it was.

#### [JOE KOGELMANN](http://twitter.com/jk82672/status/147463304221171713)

What was the logest of all the WoT books? How many words?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147464951076896768)

Longest ones have been around 390k words. Books Four and Six. I forget which was the longer.

#### [STEPHEN HART](http://twitter.com/s_l_hart/status/147462355603820545)

Any chance of reading these alternate scenes once
*A Memory of Light*
is released; on your website maybe? Kinda like DVD deleted scenes...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465009163812864)

Maybe.

#### [GREG LINDSEY](http://twitter.com/glindsey212/status/147460328500899841)

Why do you suppose Wikipedia is inaccurate, saying
*Towers of Midnight*
[is] 325,998? Should it be edited? Are those word counts reliable?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465109969711104)

Likely, theirs is without the glossary, which I just noticed mine has in it.

#### [BRYAN](http://twitter.com/thebigpiro/status/147456493539692545)

but but but...Wikipedia says
*Towers of Midnight*
is 325,998 words! Who to trust, Wikipedia or the author!? \*brain explodes\*

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465239586283520)

Just noticed my edocument has the glossary attached. Maybe that's the reason for the difference. Mine is pre-copyedit too.

#### [DASUGO](http://twitter.com/Dasugo/status/147458214588461058)

You usually go through a vicious edit phase right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/147465325863120897)

Yes. I tend to cut 10%, but Harriet's suggestions have usually added about that much, and we've balanced at the end.
