Whew. Got the flu on Sunday night, only now recovering. Time to start the
*Memory of Light*
second draft.

I'm curious—will Harriet edit RJ's last scene or are we going to see it as is?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152137847548297216)

Harriet will edit it, as she's edited everything else. (But maybe we'll post the earlier form sometime after the book's out.)

For second draft are you going through and making corrections to stuff Team Jordan pointed out?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152137996601266177)

No, second draft is for fixing things I know need fixing. The draft is pretty messy right now.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/152139208608321537)

Ah ok that's interesting. That's one great thing I love about you updating us on this is I'm fascinated at all that goes...

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/152139296747429888)

...into large books like these. It's definitely not one or two draft processes haha.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152140876607533056)

Both of the previous ones went through about a dozen drafts.

#### [MATTHEW RAMSEY](http://twitter.com/RCDLattimer/status/152133401242112000)

How long does a second draft usually take?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152138151345917952)

A couple of weeks, usually. It's different for different books, though, depending on how 'clean' the first draft is.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152151407858954242)

Yay! First scene revised. Only (...counts...) two hundred and twenty one left to go. ... Oh. Back to work, I guess.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152153149975707649)

Of course, not all scenes are the same length. A better guide will be this: I'm on page 15 of 1800 manuscript pages in the revision.
