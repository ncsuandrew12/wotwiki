Team Jordan update: We’ve been getting a lot of questions about Brandon’s note that Harriet and I are finished with
*A Memory of Light*
, and Alan is almost finished. “Finished” here refers only to the first draft. The same day that I finished
*A Memory of Light*
, I started
*A Memory of Light*
(the second draft, or at least the portion of the second draft that Brandon has sent us). Harriet has already completed that section, and is ready to move on when we receive more. Alan should finish the first draft this week, and he will immediately begin again too. We’re not by any means truly finished with the book—we’re all working very hard, and we trust that Brandon is too. We want to get every detail right, and that takes time. Don't worry; it's worth waiting for.
