Many thanks, all, for the birthday (and Koloss Head-munching Day) wishes! You are all awesome. To celebrate, I'm writing
*A Memory of Light*
. ;)

To get ready for today's writing, I have put on my "Blood and Bloody ashes" shirt from Ta'veren Tees. (https://taverentees.com/threads/)

Note that my wife stole my Koloss Head-Munching Day shirt for the day, which is why I'm not wearing it. (http://store.inkwing.com/happy-koloss-head-munching-day-t-shirt)

Also, for
*A Memory of Light*
, I did finish the early-book material I'd left for later, and am back at the ending. My shirt is very appropriate today.

Hm... I haven't given any good
*A Memory of Light*
teases today, have I? Well, right now, one of the Forsaken is wearing the image of another Forsaken.

And I was hoping you would say one of the Forsaken was wearing another's pants.

Well, that too, of course.
