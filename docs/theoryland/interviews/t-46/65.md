# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#65)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149241435785396224)

Still hard at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. Today's scenes involve lots of loud noises.

#### [MARK HOWARD](http://twitter.com/pyper134/status/149241691424030720)

Just curious, have you read the end scenes that RJ wrote? Or are you waiting till you get there?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149245100357201920)

I read them as soon as I got them. I needed to use them as a target 'goal' for the book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149255710272794624)

Now, on to a scene that finally, at long last, fulfills something Min saw long ago...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149269548825194498)

I've finished all characters except Rand and Mat. (Note, I'm not writing in order; other characters have already-written scenes after this.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149269717981462528)

Now, I have to finish Mat's climax, write a few more Rand scenes, then add in RJ's ending material. Then we're done. Very close now.

#### [PATRICK](http://twitter.com/Darkenmal/status/149271331345674240)

What are your thoughts on ending the WoT series that Robert Jordan started so long ago? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149272211163852800)

Solemnity.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149335105662484481)

After a few hours with the family, am back at work on
*A Memory of Light*
. It's slightly possible that I'll finish it sometime during the night.

#### [JENNIFER LIANG](http://twitter.com/dragonmount/status/149336144792924160)

Would that make tonight
*A Memory of Light*
Eve?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149336719899107328)

Ha. Yes, I guess it would.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149340681175965696)

You can follow along, if you wish. I have twenty small points on my outline left to hit. Maybe 10k words or so. I'll tweet as I pass them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149347053103890432)

First scene out of twenty finished. (Note that I'm using 'scene' here liberally to mean a point on the plot outline.)

#### [FRANK KWIATKOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/149346675943682049)

Can you tell us who has the last chapter?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149347136629243904)

Afraid that would spoil too much.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149347366909116416)

Note that as I approach an ending, my writing speed goes up, as I get momentum. 10k tonight is not impossible. (Though most days I do 2-3.)

#### [BRENT WEEKS](http://twitter.com/brentweeks/status/149353600617955328)

Good luck!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149354495250399232)

Thanks!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149360287135436801)

Two out of twenty scenes done. Eighteen left, and
*A Memory of Light*
will be finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149368777878933504)

Three out of Twenty of the remaining scenes in
*A Memory of Light*
have been finished. (If you're just now seeing this, check back to my last few posts.)

#### [MARCUS ENGSTROM](http://twitter.com/Rocky4228/status/149364385029173249)

How long was it after the first two books were finished until they were published?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149369005268930560)

For the first one, about a year. For the next, about six months. This will probably be closer to the first than the second.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149373879041798144)

Scene four was slightly shorter than the others. 4 out of 20 finished so far tonight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149383509608374272)

Scene #5 finished. 25% through the ending of
*A Memory of Light*
. Feeling good about these scenes. All is going very well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149384744726052865)

Some of you have asked if I got the Magic cards you sent me off of my Amazon wishlist. I did! I'm waiting to open them until I'm done with
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149385058455781376)

A few of these scenes are pretty emotional ones for me. It's been a long, long road. I started reading the WoT twenty-one years ago.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149387905104740352)

Just finished scene #6 out of the 20 remaining in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149392235266445313)

Scene seven is done. Thirteen more to go. This one...this one was tough to write.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149396007694761984)

I've apparently inspired a drinking game with this on both Twitter and Facebook. I'd join in, but: 1) Mormon. 2) BUSY WRITING END OF WOT. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149396354236547072)

Scene #8 is a tricky one. I know how it has to go, I just need to do it carefully. Getting close to having it right.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149399869134606337)

Scene #8 is finished. This is going well. I often build momentum like this during a powerful book ending, and this one is very powerful.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149400003432038400)

We shall see. We've still got three or four hours before I'd normally turn in for bed. If I start to get sleepy, I'll call it for the night.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149400117617754112)

No sense in pushing on if the quality starts to flag. Knowing myself, though, I'll be too excited to be tired for a while yet. Onward!

#### [LOCALPCGUY](http://twitter.com/localpcguy/status/149408927338082304)

Glad to hear things are ending well! I can't wait to read it. Think I have time for a full re-read before
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149410847142318080)

Depends on how quickly you read. :)

#### [DAVID MACKAY](http://twitter.com/vivalaye0/status/149400865730596864)

Cannot wait, but I agree. Is it really going to take a year to edit and publish?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149403027244204032)

I've done a dozen drafts each of the previous two books. That kind of thing takes a little bit of time...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149402813154328577)

I just did something to Mat that I've been gleefully waiting to do for three years.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149411958779678720)

Don't stress the thing I did to Mat too much. It's a little (and fun) thing I've wanted to see him do for a long time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149410700467503104)

I have finished scene #9 out of 20 I need to write before
*A Memory of Light*
is done.

#### [AVI DOBKIN](http://twitter.com/asdobkin/status/149407450271973376)

Best of luck to @BrandSanderson as I turn in for the night. I'm giddy for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149410968550649856)

Hopefully, you will wake to find the book finished.

#### [CHRISTINA BOULARD](http://twitter.com/ChristinaBWho/status/149404223501635584)

It's almost 3:30am here and I SHOULD be in bed, but I feel like I need 2 stay up and cheer you on and also to witness THE END!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149411512908394497)

Ha. Well, there are still hours left to go, I suspect. I started at...what, 9:00 here? I'm to 1/2 and it's almost 2:00?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149412109124513792)

For those asking, it's almost 2:00 am here. The night is still young.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149415300989845504)

Just finished Scene #10. Halfway there!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149434842428358656)

I don't expect it to go longer than those. After editing, I'm pretty sure we'll settle at 350-360k words. (About 10% longer than
*Towers of Midnight*
.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149437707318341632)

Brace yourselves. I just finished the last Mat Cauthon scene that, in all likelihood, will ever be written.

#### [FRANK KWIATKOWSKI](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/149440186177163264)

General writing question: after The editor edits, is it typical for an author to add/rewrite, or only the editor?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149440881605345281)

Only the author rewrites or adds. Never the editor. (in most cases.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149441211474780160)

The fourteenth scene was Mat's, and now I've finished the fifteenth scene. Five more to go, and
*A Memory of Light*
is done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149447495011938304)

Just finished scene #16. Four more to go. Guess I'm not stopping tonight, eh?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149458247458373632)

Scene #17 is finished. I was a tad on the longer side for the ones I'm doing here, as are the last three. 5:00 am here.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149458721389543424)

I keep flashing back to times I've read the WoT books through my life. Looking back, you could call Rand/Mat/Perrin my oldest friends.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149466193844121600)

Scene #18 is done. Two more to go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149469612805849088)

Scene #19 is done. Deep breath. I'm beginning the last scene I will write in the Wheel of Time, then will add RJ's ending.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149461870774992897)

I've been listening to Pandora as I do this, but am wondering if I should pick a specific song to listen to as I finish. Suggestions?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149482573742096384)

My choice for a song to play as I write the last few paragraphs here:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-0G_FI61a8>

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149486690447273984)

Ladies and gentlemen,
*A Memory of Light*
—the final book in The Wheel of Time—has been finished.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149488048156065792)

Now I'll open a metric gigaton of Magic cards that have been sent to me by fans, sleep for a day, and rest until next week.Then: revisions!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149488493406584833)

As for when the book will come out, Tor should do an announcement soon. Revisions will take a good six months. So fall, I expect.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149491208631230464)

Another common question: How many revisions will I do? The last two took about a dozen. (On non-WoT books, I do about seven or eight.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149491672886165504)

Also, it's going to be tough to give direct replies to questions right now, what with like 1000 people tweeting/facebooking at me. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149491990390784001)

But lots of people are asking about outriggers/prequels. The answer is still the same. We'd rather not risk exploiting RJ's legacy.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149492254040522752)

It is a step I don't think we want to take. Better to stop while we're ahead. I'm sorry, but they probably won't ever happen.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149492922969112576)

And now, yes, I will go to sleep. 7am here. That's 10 hours of solid writing after a full day of solid writing, so I'm beat.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149493040434786306)

Thank you all for the good wishes. May you find water and shade.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (AFTER A NAP)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149636055744774144)

Ah. Good morning, all. (Yes, it's five in the afternoon here.) Checking email, and...INBOX EXPLOSION. I guess I was expecting it. :)
