# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #81](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#81)

I'm sorry I don't have more specific WoT posts for you—I know that Harriet prefers me to be more closed-mouthed. However...

Maria from Team Jordan has finished her revision notes for the entire book, as has Harriet herself. So we're only waiting on Alan's notes.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202865283566813184)

As he's playing "Great Captain" for me on
*A Memory of Light*
, his notes are vital—and he needs to be detailed. When I get them, I can finish revising.

#### [Roberto Sánze](https://twitter.com/robsainz/status/202866931148128256)

Sooooo...there might be a sooner release date than the current for January?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202867109372497920)

It is possible, but I don't know how likely.

#### [Roberto Sánze](https://twitter.com/robsainz/status/202867486960533504)

Darn, I need to haste to be ready for
*A Memory of Light*
once it releases. Is there gonna be a ebook version along with the physical book?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202867911067574272)

(Winces.) Harriet has a distrust of ebooks; she prefers to delay the release. It is her call. (Ebook is a few months later.)

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/202870594893660161)

Do we have chapter names yet? Or do you know how many chapters there will be? Or is that a secret?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202871176723312640)

No chapter names yet, as it won't be until this draft is finished that I settle on the number of chapters. Some are being combined.

#### [Mark Prybyla](https://twitter.com/DFaninFla/status/202876831102275584)

I'm truly hoping this book is 1/3 battles/fights.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202879295792750592)

More than 1/3, I'd say...

#### [Daniel Shepard](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/202870928009474049)

Forgive me for not understanding, but what does this mean? Release date's not going to change, is it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202871282843398144)

Probably not. It's just a progress update, so people know things are still moving behind-the-scenes.

#### [Richard Collett](https://twitter.com/Collett19/status/202865406636077056)

How's The Stormlight Archive coming? I need more.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/202867005643165699)

*A Memory of Light*
comes first. I will get to the next Stormlight book soon, but not until
*A Memory of Light*
is done to my satisfaction.

So this means we will be reading the final volume sooner than first announced?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150816002635009?comment_id=21591176&offset=0&total_comments=22)

It is possible, but I don't know how likely. I still need to do two drafts, I feel. Then there are beta reads, then proofreads, then we need at least two months to get the books printed and shipped.

#### [Adam Sloan](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150816002635009?comment_id=21591233&offset=0&total_comments=22)

What does it take to be one of the beta readers?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/10150816002635009?comment_id=21591306&offset=0&total_comments=22)

Be one of the major members of fandom for years, and personally know Harriet. (Sorry.)
