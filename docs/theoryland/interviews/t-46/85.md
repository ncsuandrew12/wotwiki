# [Interview #46, Entry #85]: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#85)

Working on a new Rand scene today too. Still a few more I want to add. This is probably the last draft where I will add new scenes, though.

New Rand scene turned out great. Now, to revamp the next five to be just as awesome.

It's funny how time passes when I'm working on writing. It's been four hours since I started on the scene, and I barely noticed.

That I understand. I get in a writing groove and the next thing I know it's tomorrow!

Focus is like an alternate plane of existence.

It's funny. I make a post, like the one a while back, and then think "I'll get back and answer people in a bit." Then, four hours later, I think "Okay, scene is done. Let's see what people are saying." That timestamp glares back at me, and there are like fifty posts I haven't ever replied to.

Do you know the
*Game of Thrones*
guy? He could learn something from your work ethic.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211681342189084672)

Ha. Well, perhaps. But I could learn something from his writing skill, I suspect. We'll see how prolific I am when I'm his age.

We need @BrandSanderson to stay healthy; you're supposed to get up and stretch every 20 minutes!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211681131098144769)

Don't worry. I have a treadmill desk I work at.

How long is the book going to be at minimum?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/211626176035303424)

350k words, I'd guess. First draft was 360. Next draft trimmed about 30k. I'm slowly increasing it back up.
