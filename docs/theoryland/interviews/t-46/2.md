Is March 2012 an accurate publishing date for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 March 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/48145530668326912)

I'm basically saying "Sometime in 2012." It will depend mostly on how long revisions take.

#### [Austin Moore (12 APRIL)](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/57920576060264448)

If book doesn't make March deadline, will it be April or would it be bumped back further for a better release period?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57938340338610176)

I honestly don't know. That's going to be Tom and Harriet's decision.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/57938455686160384)

I just need to make sure I turn it in late this year sometime; from there, it could be launched any time 2012 they want.

#### Footnote

The release date ended up being pushed back first to November 2012 (announced at JordanCon 2011) and then to January 2013.
