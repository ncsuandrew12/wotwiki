Sorry to vanish for a few days, folks. Been making a big push to get
*A Memory of Light*
done. Still a lot of work to do, but the end is in sight.

Cautiously moving the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up to 90% done, reflecting work finished this week and last.

This last 10% is going to be tough to call. I'm not ready to put in the chunk that RJ wrote yet. We're close, but not there yet.

Are you starting to get a little wistful? Getting to the end must feel... so final.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132266622630117376)

Yeah. I am, and it does.
