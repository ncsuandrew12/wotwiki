[This](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/03/a-memory-of-light-ebook-release-date-confirmed)
is seriously going to increase piracy and decrease sales. Fix it! Please!
*A Memory of Light*
EBook Release

I'm afraid you have to take that up with Harriet. I've done what I can.

Will the kindle edition of
*A Memory of Light*
be released at the same time, as the hardcover?

I'm afraid that Harriet has decided there should be a delayed ebook release.
