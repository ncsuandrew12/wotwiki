Right now, taking a (short) break from the WoT rewrite to spend an evening working on the Mistborn video game script.

Any plans for a WoT game?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159889021689004032)

Yes, there are many plans. I don't know how far along they are, however.

Any news for a date on WoT?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159892379195801600)

Fall, most likely.

For those curious, I did finish the video game work I needed to do last night, and am back at work on the WoT revision today.
