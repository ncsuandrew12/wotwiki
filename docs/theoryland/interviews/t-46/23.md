# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#23)

Working on a big climactic scene. Was going to tweet that, then realized, pretty much all of them in this book fit that description...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/103566685461692416)

That's good to know. It makes more sense than something like
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
with long stretches of not-much-happening.

In other words, I think it will reassure the fans who doubt you can pull it off in just one more book. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103569654630453250)

Yeah, it's really going to be one. I'm 125k or so in, and it feels right. I'll get it all in.

I'm moving the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up 2%, to 40%. Should easily hit 50% by the end of the month.

How's the chances of a release in the spring looking in your opinion?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103650384190521344)

So so. I'll be straight with you; it would be a LOT of work to get it out then. Possible, we've done it that fast before.

However, that was when we were trying to hit the holiday season, and it resulted in a book with typos and mistakes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103650558581280768)

My guess right now is that neither Tor nor Harriet will want to push for that.

Can't wait, been WoT fan for years. You have a different style, but I can deal. I'm going to start reading your other work.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103652467824263168)

Thank you. I understand the style is different, and I hope it's not too distracting.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103613569853161473)

Shed any tears yet writing any particular scenes? ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/103652743683645442)

There have been a few tough ones.
