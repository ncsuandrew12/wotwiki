# [Interview #46: Twitter: AMOL Writing and Editing Process, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#27)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (31 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108816705609932800)

Dang. I just pulled off something in
*A Memory of Light*
that is GRRM-esque. I'm not certain if I should apologize, feel awesome, or go take a shower.

#### [SARAH WALTERS](http://twitter.com/Xaraxia/status/108817594420695040)

Haven't read GRRM, should I? Also, I recommend feeling awesome and writing more of
*A Memory of Light*
, but I'm biased.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108818534691385344)

Depends on your threshold for content. His writing is genius, but he is very brutal. I could only stomach the first one.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108818614672572416)

His short stories are awesome, by the way. I've liked every one of those I've read.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108820084524457984)

Also, the Minas Tirith theme is playing on Pandora. Perfect.

Gah, now you've got me thinking Boromir/Gawyn.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

I have no idea if Brandon saw that tweet, but his next one came after it, for what it's worth. Some
[more info](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=622#8)
was given on this in the reddit Q&A, and there might be another clue

.

Some good mythological underpinnings and references in this scene, as I believe RJ would have done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108827773128282112)

If I ever get to write the annotations for this book as I plan, this scene will be a nice one to talk about.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108828101785554944)

One of the challenges in writing these books is to get mythology right. Not too overt, with careful references. RJ left help, fortunately.

#### [JOHANN THORSSON](http://twitter.com/johannthors/status/108832211465289728)

You mean like Rand having a wound in his side, a la Jesus on the cross?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108835403410317312)

That's one of very, very many. But yes. And, you know, Rand being a sheepherder...

#### [SIMEN ISAK DITLEFSEN](http://twitter.com/SimenIsak/status/108827621575503873)

RJ used a lot of mythological inspiration. But I haven't seen a lot of Greek myths used. Have you?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108828320833081344)

It's there. Look where Perrin gets wounded.

#### [SIMEN ISAK DITLEFSEN](http://twitter.com/SimenIsak/status/108831882279534592)

ahh... The Achilles arrow?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108836083835469824)

Look up blacksmith gods. Hephaestus, Wayland. And, you know, Perun...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108828526668550144)

But I felt RJ thought Greek/Roman was overdone, so stayed away from using it as much as Norse/Celtic/Native American.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108834267743797248)

Okay, signing off for the night. I need to be up for my Q&A on reddit come noon my time. (I'll tweet a reminder.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108834445812965377)

Moved the
*A Memory of Light*
progress bar up to 48% complete to reflect work done so far this week. Been a good week.

#### [ELVAN](http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/aliciadominica/~Rciyq)

I believe you are trying to kill us by triggering extreme amounts of anticipation and excitement. Some of us don't have the heart to take it you know. Seriously though, can't wait.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/108830451048783872)

Ha. Just trying to keep everyone involved, if only in a small way. ;)
