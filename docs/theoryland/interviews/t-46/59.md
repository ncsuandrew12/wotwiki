Okay, deep breath, back to work at the WoT. Can I be finished by Koloss Head-munching Day? (December 19th.) We shall see...

Who would win—a massive Koloss or an Ogier warrior from Seanchan?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146307444446998529)

Ogier are far smarter and better-trained. A koloss would have a hard time winning.

(For those confused, Koloss Head-Munching Day happens on my birthday. It has a long backstory that won't fit into my post here.)

The short is this: A fan asked if there were any holidays in the Mistborn world. I jokingly said Koloss Head-Munching Day. Fans ran with it.

For today's
*A Memory of Light*
work, I'm jumping back in the book a little ways and catching up a character to the rest.

Just finished re-reading some important bits of WoT Book Two in order to write this next section of
*A Memory of Light*
.

When is
*A Memory of Light*
out? I thought January, but I've heard it's been put back?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146346174805323777)

My goal is to finish it by January. Sorry about the delay. It will be next year some time, but probably later in the year.

Current
*A Memory of Light*
length: 322,000 words. Moving us to 94% done, though I can't say exactly how much is left. 94% is just a guess at this point.
