That's another "Through Line" on
*A Memory of Light*
finished. Now, back to the middle of the book to write forward on another character.

So writing
*A Memory of Light*
is more like building a giant Dagwood sandwich than it is like baking a birthday cake?

...in that you're taking finished products and making them fit together as opposed to mixing it altogether start to finish...

That's it.

Question... Do you write each character in one go? The full story for that person, then splice it in with the others?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/109416681587220480)

I often do, if they are in different places. If together, I write them together.
