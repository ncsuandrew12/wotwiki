Working on one of the big, climactic sections at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
right now. Not many names left to draw, I'm afraid. A handful, maybe.

There's another of my Wheel of Time musings up at @tordotcom, this one about
*The Great Hunt*
.

By the way, as many have noted, it appears that RJ, myself, and Wheel of Time were involved in a Jeopardy! clue yesterday.

The release date for
*A Memory of Light*
, the final volume of The Wheel of Time (@torbooks ), has been revealed: http://bit.ly/x2BVp5

For people wondering, it takes a long time to go from a first draft to final draft. @BrandSanderson did 16 edits on
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### [COWSLIP](https://twitter.com/cowslip0/status/170227624092774401)

It must publish before 21.12.2012... what if the Mayan are right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170229671219298304)

Lol.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/170225113118150656)

So...January 2013? Is this because @BrandSanderson needs time to join the witness protection program before the fans learn who dies in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170229817789259776)

No, but I might need to head into it now, once the more vocal fanbase hears their book is delayed a few more months.

My respect for Harriet has gone downhill. I think If I were to look in her eyes all I'd see are $$

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170236320172613632)

I'm not sure why, since this choice might end up costing her money. It certainly isn't a market decision.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/170237402139467777)

The release date for
*A Memory of Light*
has been set. Here are my thoughts.
