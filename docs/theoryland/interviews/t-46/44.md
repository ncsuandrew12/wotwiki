*A Memory of Light*
progress bar moved to 75%. This puts it at 225k words so far, roughly the size of book eight. (Using 300k as a guess for the final.)

One of the interviews mentioned the last book getting split up into two books, did you still think 300k words is a good number?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/122083557526081536)

Yes, it's a good number. The book will run longer (mine always do) but it will be roughly that length. 400k at the upper end.
