By the way, I AM still doing the #wotrr. Been a little too busy to tweet regularly these last few weeks. Will get back into it.

For those following along, I'm right at the end of
*The Shadow Rising*
. Love this book. But man is it long. :)

Yes, I've still been writing on
*A Memory of Light*
at the same time. But I had to do the
*Alloy of Law*
copyedit last week, which slowed me a tad.

I started #wotrr same time as you and I'm just finishing
*The Path of Daggers*
! Sorry couldn't resist steaming ahead.

Ha. I'll catch up, maybe. I spend a lot of time making notes and building the outline.
