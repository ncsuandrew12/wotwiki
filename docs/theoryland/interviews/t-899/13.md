# [Interview #899: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#13)

#### Szabó Dominik

Finally, would you like to impart some message to your Hungarian readers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really appreciate my Hungarian readers. I don't think I have a specific sort of message or goal; people talk about "What's the goal of my writing," and it really is just to tell a good story. I don't sit down and say, "What's the theme I want to get across with this?" Granted, themes will grow out of one of my characters, but I don't sit down to teach a lesson. I just sit down to tell a story. That's kind of the goal of my entire career. And so I don't know if my career is to teach a lesson, other than "I want to tell great stories, and I'm glad people enjoy them."

#### Szabó Dominik

Thank you for the interview, and we wish you all the success in the future.
