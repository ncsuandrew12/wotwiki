# [Interview #899: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#9)

#### Szabó Dominik

According to recent news, the last book of the series,
*A Memory of Light*
had already been sent to the publisher. Now that you had finished the series, do you think you reached your goals? Are you satisfied with your work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. My main goal all along was to do the book in a way that Harriet would be pleased, as Robert Jordan's widow, because she had to be the guide on this. At the end of the day, my job was to satisfy her desires for a book that lived up to Robert Jordan's legacy, and I feel very confident in the way I've done that. I feel very satisfied with my work on the project. I don't think I did a good a job as Robert Jordan would have done it, but I think I did it better than anyone else—other than him—could have.
