# [Interview #899: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#6)

Speaking about writing: do you prefer any specific working method? How do you put your stories on paper?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I generally like to have a good outline; for me that's important to have an ending in mind before I begin. It's really the most vital part for me. I like explosive, powerful endings, and without knowing it ahead of time, I can’t point it [the story] to where I want it to go. So I would say that I'm an outliner. I do, however, like my characters to be more organic, to grow and come alive, and so I don't spend a lot of time trying to force my characters into a box as outlined in an outline of a book, but try to let them grow and become who they want to become, so to speak, as I write.
