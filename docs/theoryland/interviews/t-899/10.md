# [Interview #899: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#10)

#### Szabó Dominik

Would you tell us about your plans for the future? Which of your series would you like to continue?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My immediate goal is to continue the Stormlight Archive with the sequel to
*The Way of Kings*
. I'm writing that now, and I plan to finish in April so that it can be published in time for Christmas 2013. We'll see if I'm actually able to do that. Also in 2013 I have two young adult books coming out.
*The Rithmatist*
is a gearpunk fantasy about the son of a cleaning lady at a magic school—he can't do the magic himself, but he gets free tuition because his mother works there. Then there's
*Steelheart*
, which is a post-apocalyptic book about people who get super powers, but all of them turn out to be evil. The main character is a boy who thinks he saw the one weakness of
*Steelheart*
, the emperor of Chicago, and he meets up with a group of assassins that discovers these villains' weaknesses and takes them out.
