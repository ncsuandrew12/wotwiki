# [Interview #899: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#3)

#### Szabó Dominik

The majority of your novels belong to the fantasy genre. Have you ever considered trying your hands at other genres?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I recently wrote a novella,
*Legion*
, that's more a technothriller than science fiction or fantasy, but it still has a fantastic element. I expect that everything I write in the future will have some kind of fantastic element. It's what I enjoy reading, so it's what I enjoy writing.
