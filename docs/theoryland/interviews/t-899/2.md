What was it like to attend the classes of such renowned authors as David Farland at university?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dave's class was fantastic. It was really different from attending my regular college courses, because a lot of those people were good writers, but they hadn't ever published professionally. They didn't know the business, and Dave did. It was a turning point in my career where I was able to listen to a writer who had actually made a living out of it and could talk about the real world of writing. It was just really eye-opening for me to meet someone like that, to listen to them and hear their advice. It was wonderful, and Dave's a fantastic writer as well.
