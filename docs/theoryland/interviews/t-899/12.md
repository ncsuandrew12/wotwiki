# [Interview #899, Entry #12]: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#12)

Given the choice, which of your universes would you most like to live in? Which magic system would you most like to try?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, those are actually two different questions for me, because Allomancy is the one I'd like to have, but that world is pretty awful, at least during the era under the Lord Ruler, and I certainly wouldn't want to live there. The question becomes what period in what books are you talking about, because, you know, by the
*Alloy of Law*
Era, the world of Mistborn would be a pretty decent place to live. However, I do think if you're going to pick one to live in, probably
*Elantris*
at the end of the first book is the best place. They've just got a lot of neat nice things going on, and it's a pretty modernized society, so I think that would probably be the best one.
