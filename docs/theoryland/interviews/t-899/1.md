# [Interview #899: Ekultúra: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=899#1)

How did you become a writer? If I'm not mistaken you had originally planned to become a doctor...

#### Brandon Sanderson

The moment I read my first fantasy novel—it's cliché to say this, but—I said, "This is me. This is what I'm going to do." So I basically directed all of my efforts toward doing that. But my mother really wanted me to be a doctor. Toward the end of high school I let myself be convinced that writing wasn't a realistic career for me, so I started college as a biochemistry major. But before long I realized I just didn't enjoy chemistry and missed writing, so I changed my major and threw myself into writing.
