# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#18)

#### Question

All right, and second question. Without being too terribly spoilerific, what's the one thing you wanted to find out, and didn't?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is an event in the epilogue, that one of the characters performed something that seems impossible by our understanding, and Robert Jordan did not explain how or why.

#### Question

That's fair. All right. Iâ€™ve got my own fan theories, and they'll just stay there. Thanks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh huh.
