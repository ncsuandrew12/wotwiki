# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#20)

#### Question

So, this is a question expanding on the whole gardener versus architect thing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh huh.

#### Question

You say that you're an architect.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Now that—not a Wheel of Time question, actually—but your non Wheel of Time works have this whole meta world connecting them, the shard worlds and the sixteen shards and stuff. Where do you think you're going to go with that now that you . . . ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I can tell you where I'm going to go with that. I'm not sure how much I can say. For those who don't know, my epics are all connected. There are continuing characters through
*Elantris*
into Mistborn into
*Warbreaker*
into
*Way of Kings*
. It's a behind the scenes sort of thing—it's not something . . . you don't need to read them in order. It's not something you need to know in order to read one of the books. But there are continuing characters.

And I have a grand arc for what is going on. It has to do with my original pitch to my editor on the Mistborn trilogy, which was actually a trilogy of trilogies. Way back in 2005 when I told him about it, I wanted to do three trilogies: one past, one present, one future. And I wanted to do an epic fantasy trilogy, which really explored kind of mythology and magic. And then a modern day trilogy, in which the epic fantasy had become the foundations of myth and religion for a trilogy set in about a 1980s level technology. And then I wanted to do a far future science fiction, in which the magic which had gone through all of the other books became the means by which space exploration became possible and the foundation of technology, particularly faster than light technology. And so that is a core spine of the greater story that I'm telling.

#### Question

I love Wheel of Time, but please do that, too. That sounds amazing.
