# [Interview #989, Entry #10]: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#10)

#### Brandon Sanderson

People like to ask, how does it feel to be done? It feels like—I can only imagine—finishing a marathon. My wife has done one, and she's talked about how finishing one feels. It's like that. It's been a marathon of five years for me, and for a lot of us, a marathon of 23 years. And setting down that weight has been a relief, but again, it's something I couldn't set down until I was sure it was right. And I feel really good about what's happened. I'm very proud of my place in this, and very honored by my opportunity to work on it.

And that's what I wanted to share with you guys. That's my presentation, so to speak. But we are going to do some questions. We have about 20 minutes left for questions. And so I'm going to go—there are three hands that went up really fast, and I'm going to go through these questions. Go ahead.
