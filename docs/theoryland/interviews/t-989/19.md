# [Interview #989, Entry #19]: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#19)

#### Question

I actually do have a spoiler question, and I don't know . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, why don't you save that till afterward and come ask us.

#### Question

Okay. But I do want to say that your answer to his question there makes a whole lot more sense nowâ€”that you didn't know that . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not know either.

#### Question

Okay.

[laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nope, sorry. When I say he wrote the epilogue, he
*wrote*
the epilogue. And he left notes on a lot of things, but he didn't leave notes on the things he'd already finished, because we didn't need to know how to write those.
