# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#24)

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, we'll do these two last questions, and then I'll talk a little bit more about books that we have for sale, and then we will bid you farewell.

#### Question

Okay. I'll be quick. Just first, thanks both of you all again. This has been an amazing adventure. The other question is: So, is there any chance, or is the door open for the Wheel of Time story to be told in other forms of media, so like movie or television some time in the future?

#### Harriet McDougal

The motion picture rights have been sold to Universal, and they are working on development of
*The Eye of the World*
as a first movie. I am told that they're working on a second draft of the script. I haven't seen word one.

#### Question

Awesome. Thank you.
