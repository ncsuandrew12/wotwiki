# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#25)

#### Question

Actually, similar question, though slightly broader scope. So Robert Jordan . . . well, I should say the Wheel of Time computer game came out mid 90s. I personally wasn't too fond of it, but I'm hoping that other computer games and things like that based on that world will come out. Any plans for that, is signed publishing . . .

#### Harriet McDougal

The game rights . . . Well, forgive me, I think they're doing business as Manetheren. They were Red Eagle. It's the same people. It's just a change of the moniker. And they're working on it

.

#### Question

You know that . . . we haven't heard any press about it. Is there any details available on the net?

#### Harriet McDougal

I don't know.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not that we know. No major movement right now.

#### Question

And last, when's your Mistborn computer game scheduled to come out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mistborn we pushed back until 2014 because we worried that we don't have specifics about the potential new console releases in 2013, and we figured we would rather be . . . A lot of you are like, hmm, I can't say anything. [laughter] We figured we would rather be a newer title on the new consoles than a title that got lost in the shuffle of all the hype about a potential 720 or things like that.

#### Question

Sound reasonable. Thank you.
