# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#14)

#### Question

So, I've heard you answer or explain in other interviews, and Mrs. McDougal, you expressed your late husband's fear, or not being comfortable with others writing in his universe. But I'm still curious, did he leave notes, or other bits of information about the outrigger novels that he has alluded to so many times?

#### Harriet McDougal

About the outrigger novels, he left . . . it's either one sentence, or two sentences.

#### Question

Okay.

#### Harriet McDougal

And that's a major reason why they won't exist. There was not enough. Of course, there are all the notes on this series and all. I can't tell you what he said, because for the people in the room who haven't finished, oddly enough, there's a spoiler in there. But it just couldn't be. It wouldn't be in any way his outriggers. And I'm sorry.

#### Question

No, I understand that. But I appreciate the answer.

#### Harriet McDougal

But they sounded wonderful.

#### Question

Thank you.

#### Harriet McDougal

You're welcome.
