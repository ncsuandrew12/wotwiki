# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#26)

#### Brandon Sanderson

All right. So, by way of farewell to everyone, there's just a few things I want to say. First off, if anyone's watching or anyone here, my website is brandonsanderson.com. And if you actually go on there and click on the
*Warbreaker*
—I need a new website, by the way. I'm sorry, my website's antiquated. But you click on the little gem that says
*Warbreaker*
, you can download
*Warbreaker*
, one of my novels, for free. And again, DRM free. It's a free sample. It's a complete epic fantasy. I released it in 2009, I think. So, it's a standalone, and I would recommend that to you. And I thank you guys all for listening.

The other things I want to promote—we'll have Dwayne hold them up over there, if you would. We have copies of both
*Legion*
and
*The Emperor's Soul*
, or are we sold out?

#### Dwayne

We're out of
*Legion*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, well we have copies of
*The Emperor's Soul*
.
*The Emperor's Soul*
is one of the breather novels I did between books last year. It is a novella. It's about 200 pages. It's set in the same world as
*Elantris*
, but it stands on its own. It uses different characters. If you've never tried anything of mine, it's actually a really good place to start because it is so short. But it does all the things that I love to do—really interesting magic system, kind of approaches fantasy from my . . . I think you'll really like it.

I think it's the strongest piece of short fiction I've ever done. It's about a woman who is hired to create a forgery of the soul of the emperor. He's been wounded in the head, left as a vegetable, and his people want her to create a duplicate soul to stick in there so they can pretend he's still around.

Okay, and you have
*Legion*
back of the store.
*Legion*
is another one. What else do you have back there, Dwayne? Do you have . . . We don't have any Wheel of Time back stock, but we have
*Alloy of Law*
? They're gone, okay. [laughter]

#### Dwayne

All I have left here right now is two and three of Mistborn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Two and three of Mistborn, okay. [laughter] And
*Emperor's Soul*
. Really, if you haven't tried that one, give that a try. I will be hanging around for a little bit longer signing books. Harriet will as well. So thank you guys for welcoming us in.

[applause]
