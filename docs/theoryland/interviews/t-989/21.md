# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#21)

#### Question

Hi. So, you mentioned earlier that you have a tendency to write books you're not supposed to write, so you could kind of take a break.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, uh huh.

#### Question

I assume a couple of those are like
*Alloy of Law*
and
*Legion*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Legion was one, yep.

#### Question

So, I really liked those books, but it seems kind of mean of you to leave so many unresolved plot threads. [laughter] Any chance we'll get anything there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah,
*Legion*
I actually wrote as a television show pitch, was the idea for it . . . pitch a series. And I immediately sold it to Lionsgate. And so, we'll see. It's always hard to say what will happen in Hollywood because there's so much moving there, and to get the pieces in place to make a show or a movie just takes so much work. But I'm hopeful that you will see more there. I am doing more with
*Alloy of Law*
. I'll explain that in a minute. Okay?

#### Question

Thank you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep.
