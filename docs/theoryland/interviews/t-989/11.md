# [Interview #989: Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal at Microsoft Research, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=989#11)

#### Question

Yes. Many authors tend the write themselves into their books. I was just wondering if Robert Jordan had done that, and in particular, if he had written himself in as Rand's
*ter'angreal*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Had he written himself into the book? Robert Jordan did write himself in, but it's not—I think you're thinking of Rand's
*angreal*
. It's actually something else. It's the
*ter'angreal*
that they find in the Ebou Dar cache, which is a man—a jolly man statue that is full of stories. And that was Robert Jordan's cameo that he wrote himself in.
