## [Entry #1](./t-247/1)

#### Ursula

I attended the book signing in Pasadena, also. It was Halloween, so I'm the one who was in the long Turkish coats and gold cap.

## [Entry #2](./t-247/2)

#### Question

A man asked if the Dark One can resurrect anyone after death.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ answered that, yes, the Dark One can resurrect any soul, but probably doesn't want to bring back someone who hates him.

## [Entry #3](./t-247/3)

#### Question

Another man asked about Siuan's Talent of seeing
*ta'veren*
. Was she able to see them after she was stilled?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Question

Could she see them after she was Healed?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Question

So, if the ability to see them was based on the Power, what about the Ogier Elder who knew Rand was
*ta'veren*
?

#### Robert Jordan

For Siuan, yes, for the Ogier, no. The Ogier was able to see (or feel, I can't remember which RJ said) the Pattern shifting around Rand.

## [Entry #4](./t-247/4)

#### Robert Jordan

And another asked the usual question about his writing day, to which he gave the usual answer.

## [Entry #5](./t-247/5)

#### Question

Another man asked if Cyndane is actually Lanfear, even though she denies it?

#### Robert Jordan

And RJ laughed, and said RAFO.

## [Entry #6](./t-247/6)

#### Robert Jordan

Then RJ explained that all the men in his family are strong because the women kill and eat the weak ones, and he wanted questions from women.

#### Ursula

I'm sorry, but I faded out at that point and don't remember those questions.

## [Entry #7](./t-247/7)

#### Ursula

When I got to the table to get my books signed, I asked my question.

## [Entry #8](./t-247/8)

#### Ursula

Why is there no religion?

#### Robert Jordan

RJ answered that most religion is people meeting to affirm their own impressions and reassure each other. In a world where the miraculous happens every day, religion is not really needed. And there is no Book. And I said, so you didn't write any, and RJ said Yes.

## [Entry #9](./t-247/9)

#### Ursula

It was great, and I really appreciate the chance to talk to Mr. Jordan, even for a moment.

Cheers,
Ursula
