#### Brandon Sanderson

Now that the mass market paperback of
*Towers of Midnight*
has been released, I've added signed
[hardcover copies of the book](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/item/51/Signed-Towers-of-Midnight-andmdash-Hardcover)
to my online
[store](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/)
. I will personalize each copy to your requestâ€”you can have me write something like "Music to dazzle" or "Iron to bind" if you like. And of course
[all of my other books](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/1/Signed-Hardbacks-and-Bookplates)
are available as well.

Because I'm going on tour in North America and the UK all November long, the sooner you can get your order in, the better. (If getting a book by December 24th is important to you.) In fact, for international orders, we're setting a deadline of November 1st so I can sign everything before I leave. The U.S. deadline is December 5th.
[Jewelry orders](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/4/Jewelry)
have different deadlines; see below. Now, if your order comes in too late we will still do what we can, but the likelihood your order will arrive before December 24th goes way down.
