Harriet killed Siuan.

Brandon also killed someone significant but he won't say who.

## [Entry #2](./t-962/2)

#### Trae Cooper

RJ left specific notes that Min's Alivia viewing was supposed to be incidental, and an example of unreliable narrator even in the case of Min's viewings. The Foretelling/dreams about the boat were supposed to be along the same lines.
