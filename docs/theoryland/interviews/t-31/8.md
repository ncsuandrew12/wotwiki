# [Interview #31: LOC Signing Report - Delemin, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=31#8)

#### Robert Jordan

He expressed several views about various translations of WoT. He heard the Swedish translation was very good, and the Dutch translators had an extensive correspondence with him. He said the only translation he read was the beginning of the German translation, but he hated the covers, he mentioned one as featuring a rear view woman, wearing only a strand of pearls, raising her hand to stop a band of armored horsemen. His favorite covers were on the Spanish editions.
