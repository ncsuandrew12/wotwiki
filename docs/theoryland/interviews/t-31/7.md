# [Interview #31, Entry #7]: LOC Signing Report - Delemin](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=31#7)

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan said he didn't give Randland a name because he always found it unrealistic for a fantasy world to have a name. After all, we don't have a real name for our world. He also said he always left something unresolved at the end of each book. He says we never have everything wrapped up in our lives, so why should his characters? He considered leaving a hook at the end of the last book and never resolving it. : - < > (screaming in anguish)

#### Footnote

This is the first of several mentions of the 'hook'; some believe this has to do with Aviendha's visions of the future in
*Towers of Midnight*
.
