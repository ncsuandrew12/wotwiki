#### Robert Jordan

He kept open the possibility of doing a book set in the Fourth Age after the events of WoT had become myth, but refused to do a prequel or sequel. When asked about doing a series on the Age of Legends, he said that before the Bore the Age of Legends was too dull, and by the end of WoT we will know enough about the Age of Legends after the Bore that a book about it would have nothing new.
