## [Entry #1](./t-1074/1)

#### ericth

What is Odium's edge. Vin and Ati killed each other but Rayse has downed 3 shards and survived. Was it skill, ability, numbers or possibly un-dispersed power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some combination of the above.

## [Entry #2](./t-1074/2)

#### ericth

Could Sazed take down Rayse since he has two shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Rayse is VERY scared of Sazed. However, given Sazed is a composite of two diametrically opposed shards, he finds it very difficult to act.
