*A Memory of Light*
? Click

.

#### [SHAWN J](http://twitter.com/Jonzman/status/121651361644417024)

Not sure if you wish to defend yourself:
[http://www.reddit.com...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/l1wfp/would_you_like_your_name_to_appear_in_a_memory_of/c2p3nf3)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121665414492196864)

Thanks for the heads up.

#### [PETER AZP](http://twitter.com/PeterAzP/status/121645891517030401)

"The auction will be through eBay and 10% of the proceeds will go to the Mayo Clinic" Wait, 10%? What about to the other 90?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121665615583916032)

To Jordancon, a non-profit. (It's all there in the blog post.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121666296675966976)

On the
*A Memory of Light*
name drive: this is PRIMARILY a fund raiser for Jordancon, which Harriet and I believe deserves support.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121666510983929856)

For a while, I've been wanting to do this to help Jordancon make ends meet, as I think it is a great way to honor RJ's name and legacy.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121667005853081600)

Please note that Jordancon HAS applied to be tax-exempt as a 501(c)3. This means you will probably be able to deduct your donations.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (10 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123587408011862016)

Cindy Goodman, just drew your name to be in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123878622288297984)

Jason Zigmont, I just used (a variation of) your name in
*A Memory of Light*
. Details, for those confused,
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Name)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123994191570272256)

Glen MacDonald, welcome to the Deathwatch Guard. (
[Explanation](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (13 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124576966098681856)

Running on too little sleep; I'm having trouble getting
*A Memory of Light*
written on the plane. Instead, I'm going to start filling in name placeholders.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124578889946238976)

**Shane Spears**
, you are first. Yes, you will be Aiel. There's really no way I could pass that up.
**Steven Karam**
, you are in
*A Memory of Light*
too.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/124579240149647361)

So everyone who donates gets their name in? Or are you just selecting a few?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124579987532685312)

Selecting semi-randomly, I'm afraid. Everyone is in 'spiritually' but I won't have enough names for all.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124582128892645376)

**Eric Peters**
, you're in.
**Kimberly Readdy**
, you are wise, are you not?

#### [ALCHEMIST](http://twitter.com/Dinstaardude/status/124581689451229184)

Can you say approximately how many names you will be needing? just so i know just how small my chance is... :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124582213282041856)

Maybe a hundred.

#### [NATHAN SMITH](http://twitter.com/_ndsmith/status/124580129996423168)

What do you have in as placeholders?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124582371327610880)

I use "\*\*\*" to placehold in books, sometimes with one letter at the end to keep different placeheld people straight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124585691312164864)

**Eleanor Pettener**
, you are soon to be wise.
**Laura Hayden**
, you're in.
**Shani Gamble**
, are you a boy or a girl? Name websites can't decide.

#### [JAMES STARKE](http://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/124584696263868416)

Have you started drawing names for the JordanCon auction? Also, there's no clear date as to when the drawing really "ends" ...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124585994522591232)

Yes, this is for the JordanCon deal. I'm pretty sure that the first cutoff is right. Anyone before then has a chance.

#### [SHIVAM BHATT](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/124583772556500993)

How do you decide which names you're going to pick? is it based on sound or?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124586124374065152)

Sometimes, I draw. Others, I just scroll, then stop at a name and work on it a moment. See if it works.

#### [FANTASY AUTHOR](http://twitter.com/AuthorRTkaelin/status/124583174851399680)

(waving hand wildly) How about dropping in a fellow author? Granted, an indie author, but an epic fantasy indie author.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124586369837301760)

Nothing wrong with being indie. But, in this case, I'm only using people who donated.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124588794308599808)

For all still wondering what's up with these names, and how to join in the fun,
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
is that link again.

#### [CHAD ROSENTHAL](http://twitter.com/cyfer13/status/124595059982204928)

Is there a spot where you post the names? Just in case we miss the tweets?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124595703774326784)

I will try to post them all at the end.

#### [ZACAJ](http://twitter.com/zision/status/124594446925971456)

What are the chances of a name getting used if you donate?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124596040514027520)

Hard to say. It will depend on number of donators and number of names needed. Between 1% and 10% maybe?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (18 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126178900295434240)

**Eric Allen**
, you're in the Tower Guard. Someone just swore at you, but he swears at lots of people. (
[How to get in](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126482462967734272)

**Einar Laastad Kjosavik**
, the good news is you're an Asha'man. The bad news is that one of the Forsaken just balefired you.

#### [SELENE O'ROURKE](http://twitter.com/LenaOR/status/126493763832000513)

So if half my name is a Forsaken's alias, and the other half is an Aiel chief, should I even think about going on the list?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126494952208351232)

Ha. Well, I do change most of the names, so anything can theoretically be used.

#### [JALIL JAMES](http://twitter.com/JalilTerror/status/126496808217227265)

Hey man, so If we donate to the good cause we are guaranteed a spot in the book or names get pulled off the list at random?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126513945904283648)

Mostly random, I'm afraid. There is one 'sure shot' auction coming up, but last time that went for A LOT of money.

#### [COEN ZUIDERVAART (20 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/CoenZuid/status/127092845436870657)

How many names do you still need in the book? And how many new names are there actually? Was just curious to those numbers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127098196089511936)

I'll use around a hundred in the book, I think. Still need to choose most of those.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127122260648665088)

**Mikayla Micomonaco**
, congrats! You're in
*A Memory of Light*
. I hope you don't mind being a
*damane*
.
[Details](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127142428711989250)

**Margaret St. John**
, you are a Seanchan general. (Using your maiden name; thanks for providing that. It worked great.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127140350635675648)

**Joff Brown**
, I drew your name next. I made you into a city, actually.

#### [JEFF WEISSBERG](http://twitter.com/corruptcollect/status/127153155812237313)

A "city" in the Blight?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127189744269541378)

*A Memory of Light*
will reveal it for sure.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (21 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127589249628389377)

People are asking how many more names I'll use, as the book is 80% done. I left placeholders in dozens of names earlier that will be filled.

#### [DAMIEN BAUMGART](http://twitter.com/LowmanX/status/127589731772010496)

Are you just dropping names in as is or will they be "Wheel of Time-ified"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127620687685894144)

WoT-ified.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (24 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/128564698399510528)

**Alex Prescott**
, you are in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/128580550515638272)

**Jonathan Burt**
and
**Jonathan Brockelman**
, you two are a pair of Whitecloaks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (25 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/128969279679901699)

Need a name for a sister from the Green Ajah. And...the name chosen was David Emery, who entered the name of his late sister,
**Filis**
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/131407930611335168)

The
*A Memory of Light*
[name auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/170721177376?ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649#ht_932wt_932)
has begun. One winner. Or enter the
[drawing](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
, multiple winners.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (3 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132232441359376385)

I am still picking names to go in the book, as per this
[blog post](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/1021/A-MEMORY-OF-LIGHT-Naming-Rights-for-JordanCon-and-the-Mayo-Clinic)
. Should be more of those tonight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (4 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132474299415150592)

The "Get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
" charity auction had to be restarted due to ebay issues. Here's the
[new link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/170722957609)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132495802265370625)

Enough people have asked, so it bears repeating. The name auction and the name drawing are different. Explanation
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/page/65)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (29 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/141578261900689409)

Thursday is the final day to enter the drawing to get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
. Details
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142280057061244929)

Today's the final day to enter the drawing (& support JordanCon) to get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
. Last chance.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142376292111745024)

The drawing to get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
closes to entries in 4 hours. I still have a lot of names to draw.

#### [DAN GOLDMAN](http://twitter.com/Knifelunatic/status/142462574972239872)

How many more names are left to draw?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (2 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142635970653724673)

Still a good fifty, I'd say.

#### [REBECCA LOVATT](http://twitter.com/Becca_Lovatt/status/149253944038785024)

Have you been using people's names for characters? Haven't seen any posts/updates with that in a long time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149255406047342592)

I've been putting in placeholders, and will be drawing out names over the next few months to replace them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (28 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152137656866844672)

**Shaun Davis**
, I just used your name in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152140639134416896)

**Shiv Whorra**
, I needed another name, and you're in too.

#### [KELLY](http://twitter.com/cornax/status/152140229422223360)

Is there a running list somewhere of the reader names you've used? And I hope you're feeling completely well soon. : )

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152140712333414402)

We'll post them all once I'm done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152141056702558208)

For those asking about names: this was done as a fund-raiser for JordanCon, so I'm no longer taking names. (Sorry.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152141375138316288)

[Explanation follows](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/KNgmY/LeXfR/blog/1021/A-MEMORY-OF-LIGHT-Naming-Rights-for-JordanCon-and-the-Mayo-Clinic?m=7&y=2011&d=10)
. (I do this sort of thing for all of my books, though, so there will be chances for other books.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152145187056005120)

**Robert Moreau**
and
**Robert Rose**
, you two are next. Welcome to
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [SIMON ST. ERIC](http://twitter.com/Simonsteric/status/152147326385926144)

It is so exciting to see you pulling the names out of the hat... how many do you think you'll end up using? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152151647831867392)

Still many more.

#### [BRANDON BALLENGER](http://twitter.com/btballenger/status/152146437080219648)

Since you're not taking names anymore and have a full rough draft, could you make a guess at our odds of being drawn?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152151907467665409)

Really hard to guess. I have about 1,000 placeholders in the book, as told to me by Word, but...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152152059083366400)

Most of those are not "replace a name here" notes, but instead "Look this up" or "describe this better" or "continuity check."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (29 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152518718696587266)

**Brandon Bryant**
, welcome to the Band of the Red Hand. (Unfortunately, we're not accepting new names.
[Details](http://www.mistborn.com/blog/1021/)
)

#### [CHRISTOPHER SKINNER](http://twitter.com/MaverickTempest/status/152519961653420032)

I know no new namesâfor those of us who put ours in the hat before, how many spots approximately are left? What are our chances?!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152520720260403200)

I have no idea, I'm afraid. There are about 2k people in the drawing. Maybe a hundred names? Rough guesses.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (3 JANUARY 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154338583703060481)

**Daniel Egonsson**
, I drew your name for
*A Memory of Light*
. (Unfortunately, we're not accepting new names. Details: http://www.mistborn.com/blog/1021/)

#### [HUNTER SESTREN](https://twitter.com/HunterSestren/status/154338693157634049)

But for those of us in the drawing we still have a shot right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154343552988626944)

Yes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154343465621274624)

**Gavin Doyle**
, you're in too. (Yes, I will eventually post a list of all of these.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154346691947012097)

**Jacob Figler**
, you're next. (Sorry, ladies. I'll draw some female names soon.)

#### [JACOB FIGLER](https://twitter.com/FakeJigler/status/154352694788763648)

Hey that's me!!! Are you saying my name is going to be in
*A Memory of Light*

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154353436098445312)

Yup. You're in the Band of the Red Hand.

#### [JACOB FIGLER](https://twitter.com/FakeJigler/status/154354211759472640)

#### [JACOB FIGLER](https://twitter.com/FakeJigler/status/154411352407023617)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154349980658827265)

today, but yours is it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156526570025123841)

, your name came up next.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156893204875190273)

**Nathan Sawyer**
, you were drawn next.

#### [ROBERT ROTH](https://twitter.com/nomadroth/status/156914122410303488)

Do you or your assistant keep a list of drawn names? Can you post them?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156938966606680065)

I do keep a list, and will post them eventually.

#### [SEAN RYAN](https://twitter.com/SeanRyanIsGreat/status/156910013573632000)

When you write a book do you fill the less important names in later?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156939118918635520)

Often I do just that. It can break the flow of writing to develop the right name, particularly when I might cut that scene.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (13 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157906743710597121)

**Angela Ryddingwood**
, I have drawn your name.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157967875762688000)

**Bach Payson**
, I put you in
*A Memory of Light*
, but immediately killed you. Sorry 'bout that.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157968540157214720)

Oh, and
**Bryan Ragon**
, same goes for you. You died well, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157968954474774528)

**Craig Foster**
, you round out the trio of dead Borderlanders I needed for this scene.

#### [GREG LINDSEY](https://twitter.com/glindsey212/status/157972559349022721)

Just curious Brandon, are the names coming out of the proverbial hat, or do you look for names that can be easily WOTified?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974766588936192)

Most things are pretty easy to wot-ify. And, since I can use either first or last, I haven't yet found any that don't work.

#### [SEAN CORSON](https://twitter.com/smcorson/status/157972027209293824)

Are you changing the names of people you put in
*A Memory of Light*
to make them more "Randland" appropriate?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974807747641344)

They are changed.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (16 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159036169634594818)

**Michael Gonzalez**
, your name came up next. (Yes, I am wot-izing all of these.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (20 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160485359954825216)

**Mione Haak**
, I drew your name for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160486103781085185)

**Neil Tweed**
, you too.

#### [NEIL TWEED](https://twitter.com/neil_tweed/status/160625571628462080)

Who am I? Dark or light? Do I die well?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160627997878140928)

I try not to use fan names for the shadow very often. I actually named some woods after you.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160628069269381120)

You would have been one of the original owners of the land where the woods were, I should think.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160624946467438592)

**Nikhil Rode**
and
**Nils Loodin**
, I needed two Aiel scouts.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (23 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161590160243429376)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161751782043815936)

**Paul Benish**
, hope you look good in the
*hadori*
.

#### [DANIEL NELSON](https://twitter.com/ssgt_bus/status/161742193772593153)

I'm confused. You are still using names but won't take anymore? So my name may still come up assuming you aren't done us ...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161751897156493312)

It very well might. If you are on the list, there is a chance.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (25 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094063863070720)

**Pia Maria Vaajakallio**
, you are Aes Sedai.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162108833433518081)

**Maureen Sampson**

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (26 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162438574959108096)

**Harm Wieringa**
, your name came up next.

#### [SHAUN DUQUETTE](https://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/162774177726738432)

Taking a long time to add the names hehe

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (27 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162780893398839296)

I'm doing the first revision, and running across places where I left placeholders instead of names.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162799825803423744)

**Jordan White**
, you're a wolf.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162801352676868096)

**Lindsey Turnbow**
, you too.

#### [M. KLOMPENHOUWER](https://twitter.com/431/status/162808937194852352)

Is anyone keeping track of the names that are being drawn for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162823017653747712)

Yes, they are. We'll post them eventually.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (30 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164077947869855745)

**Savannah Rose Young**
, you're a Seanchan general.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164078966368505857)

**Sally Rankin**
, your name came up too.

#### [ZACHARY NORTH](https://twitter.com/ZacharyNorth/status/164079412495663104)

They all get changed. Some as little as Thom or Mat (if appropriate.) Some to things very different.

#### [ADAM GOUCHER](https://twitter.com/adamgoucher/status/164083204075171842)

How many names got submitted?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164087044698685441)

Three thousand, I think.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (6 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166516206680027136)

**Anna Roberts**
and
**Andrew Holcombe**
, I drew your names most recently for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166539307333595137)

**Caitlin Sullivan**
, you're in the White Ajah.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166545178520330240)

**Courtney Gliszczynski**
, your name came up next. I think I'll adapt your first name, not your last, if that's all right...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166570278770581504)

**Michael Sarcone**
, you asked to be a Darkfriend for some reason, and I obliged.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (7 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166919906200260608)

**Chris Gilbert**
, you entered your son's name into
*A Memory of Light*
and it has been used.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (8 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167294445115539457)

Drew a bunch of names I didn't report.
**Eric Silva**
,
**Hugh Hill**
,
**Sean Little**
,
**Rion Kinosaki**
,
**Helen Cousins**
,
**Eyal Weinstock**
.

#### [SEAN LITTLE](https://twitter.com/Gaidin_of_SDS/status/167297027464630272)

This is Sean Little, the guy that emailed you previously regarding putting in a group name. Did that entry have...

#### [SEAN LITTLE](https://twitter.com/Gaidin_of_SDS/status/167297065423077376)

...
*San D'ma Shadar*
as the name?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167313438786334720)

Yes.

#### [SEAN LITTLE](https://twitter.com/Gaidin_of_SDS/status/167313944103497728)

Thank you very much.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167315027722895360)

Trying to figure out the
*San*
in that phrase, though. Is the "San" a name, or a word in the Old Tongue I'm missing?

#### SEAN LITTLE

The translation used on the site (made by our Old Tongue experts) is Slayers of the Shadow. I could ask for the exact translation.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167317668871938048)

That works for me. I actually put the name in a place where it could refer to a group, so I'll tweak it to do so.

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167319363806961665)

Your favorite Two Rivers man, Azi al'Thone, back to bug you again :D I had put in an entry for SDS as well... and since...

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167319538663292928)

...I'm a member of SDS of
[TV.Net](http://TV.Net)
, I'm wondering what (if any) possibility there is of making Azi part of it?

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167319732456923136)

Of course, I understand if that's complicated or doesn't fit with the storyâhad to ask anyways.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167327986369040385)

The group is referenced by Mat as being part of a historical battle.

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167328461323649025)

Oh okay! Yes, that would be really hard to make work then :P Thanks for the response, Great Lord :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169549047865147392)

Working on one of the big, climactic sections at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
right now. Not many names left to draw, I'm afraid. A handful, maybe.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169553015987126274)

Remember, there is a special group of Dragonsworn in the Last Battle representing all who donated, so even if you aren't named, you're there.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (15 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169869351539843072)

**Roger Trask**
and
**Charlie Bachelder**
, turns out I needed two more Aiel to fight in the Last Battle.

## [Entry #2](./t-639/2)

#### Towers of Midnight

This entry is a collection of tweets by Brandon announcing the names of the fans who won the charity contest to get their names in

,
[Padra](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/op/padra.html)
was named after
[Tricia Erikson](http://www.tarvalon.net/content/padra-sedai-blue-ajah-tricia-erickson-has-returned-creator)

I missed these tweets by Brandon (date unknown), but Linda kindly shared them with me:

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Oh, one more. Joel

Also,

Also, John
[Sloan](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/s/slone.html)
, you survive.

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (28 September 2009)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4463399632)

Most readers know that Robert Jordan looked to real world names and places as inspiration for names in the WoT.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4463445321)

In order to help maintain this feel, Iâm doing the same. For
*Towers of Midnight*
, Iâm looking for inspiration in the list of names from a fund raiser.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4463983763)

First name: Adam
[Hahn](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/h/hahn.html)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4463993378)

Second name: Alfred

Hotard.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4464086038)

@howardtaylerâlol. I actually used the Adrienne part. Beautiful name, with a very 'WoT' feel to it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (29 SEPTEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4464279037)

Laura
[Negin](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/geography/tar_valon/negin/index.html)
, you ended up as a village near Tar Valon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (30 SEPTEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4492507143)

Breen, Alejandro
[Uso](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/uz/uso.html)

*Towers of Midnight*

*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (3 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6297960345)

Paul Postuma, I named a door after you in
*Towers of Midnight*
. [?]

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6298737136)

The door will make sense in the bookâs context. Remember, I usually keep posts about unpublished WoT books intentionally obscure.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6316516357)

Sarah
[Kainec](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/k/kainea.html)
, how good are you with a spear?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6317508276)

@Galadriena You're Sarah, then?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6317932642)

Well then, your earlier reply was perfect. Watch for the name Kainea in
*Towers of Midnight*
...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 JULY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17481178760)

Just realized that, amusingly, I gave a name to an extant, unnamed WoT character. Therefore, I retconned a WoT fan into an earlier book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17481514290)

Robert Jordan often picked names for the WoT based on names in our world. I didn't do this in
*The Gathering Storm*
, and it felt wrong.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17481556022)

He did it because the WoT world is our world, in another time. Thom, Mat, Elayne, etc. My names were immersion-breaking.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17481570682)

This is working much better, trust me. They will all be changed to fit the world.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (23 JULY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19381282886)

#### [Nicholas FreeburnÂ (13 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/nfreeburn/status/146680746105511936)

You are cheapening a former collection of masterpieces with your "get your name in a book" competitions. Lost all respect.

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (13 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146681979239272450)

I would feel worse about it if Robert Jordan hadn't done it too. And GRRM. And Stephen King. And Asimov. And Anne McCaffrey...

#### [DENNIS HIGBEE](http://twitter.com/den_down_unda/status/146706614131507200)

Did those authors auction off naming rights, though? They've all Tuckerized friends/family, but that's not the same thing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146708373855940609)

Many of them did them as charity auctions at various conventions, I believe. It has a long tradition at sf cons.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146708494765137921)

I tried to list only people who had specifically put in fans, not just people they know.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146683189254033410)

RJ did it in a pretty limited way, though. That's why I defended it at first, but IMO it was a little gratuitous in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146703864937189377)

What do you mean, limited? Pretty much every name Jordan used was adapted or straight lifted from our modern world or mythology.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146705504931033088)

I was specifically talking about fan names. Even fan names don't bother me so long as they're smooth as the parallels all are...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146705600737325056)

...but in
*Towers of Midnight*
, there were names dropped in when it seemed there was no practical purpose to name the characters in question.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146705918598459392)

Like, the characters showed up, got named, went away, and never came back. For example...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146706070461612032)

"Two MaidensâSurial and Lerianâguarded the open doorway to the hallway..." and another example (cont)...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146706249176723456)

"They stepped through the gateway into a small alley, guarded by two MaidensâLerian and Heidia..." In cases like that...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146706361307246593)

...it seems like name-dropping for the sake of it. Though I'm sure the effect is exacerbated for those in the know.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146706263777099776)

RJ named a ton of characters with no practical purpose who never showed up again. Brandon's intent was to follow that practice.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146706747501981696)

Sure, but RJ also had a ton of unnamed characters, and IMO didn't name them awkwardly like those two examples I gave.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146706856637763584)

I'm not sure if you noticed, but there was a lot of discussion about this after
*Towers of Midnight*
came out. Many people noticed it.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146707436928114689)

I didn't notice the discussion, and those examples don't look at all awkward. But it wouldn't surprise me If RJ did a better job.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146707698237448193)

Brandon also has plenty of unnamed characters. I'm just saying RJ's use of random named characters wasn't particularly limited. [And of course, no one ever said that it was. His use of fan names was limited.]

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146707743326220288)

The reason why they're awkward is became the naming of the characters is a sideline to what's actually going on, rather than...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146708071807320065)

...serving a purpose in the narrative. It's a subtle difference, that could be easily solved with a tiny bit of effort. (IMO)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146708298828226560)

Seems to me RJ had a lot of named characters with no particular narrative purpose. Others may have a different impression.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146708658246516736)

You misunderstand me. Characters can have all ranges of purpose. That's not a problem. But how is the name worked in?

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146708990250844161)

No, I understand you just fine.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146709129531113472)

But in any case, there's no point being defensive about it. Either the criticism is important to Brandon or it isn't. \*shrug\*

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146709620524711937)

I suggest that the names stuck out more when Brandon did it than when RJ did it largely because readers knew what Brandon was doing...

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146709721267699712)

...whereas the writing process was much more of a black box for RJ.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146709833712799744)

Didn't I already suggest that? But again, it could easily be smoother with a little effort.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146710160532963328)

And that's a difference Brandon is fine with. Other things he tries to do more like RJ but doesn't quite because he's not RJ.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146711664690069504)

Yes, we're aware that Brandon is fine with this difference. Sometimes it's best to err on the side of caution, when possible.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146710585868951553)

And as I said, the examples you gave look smooth enough to me.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146710965231173632)

Yes, but you defend nearly everything Brandon does. We're talking about something that bothered several fans, not just me.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146711023531991040)

Again, either the criticism matters, or it doesn't.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146710402959540224)

"could easily be smoother with a little effort" is very easy for a non-writer to say.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146712322029785088)

Something very easy to demonstrate, even for someone who doesn't write much. (I do write some, by the way.)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146712417123053568)

If it's too difficult to make smoother, then just don't name the characters it's not necessary. If the best you can do is...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146712493824294912)

...throw the names in a parenthetical, then perhaps the characters simply don't need to be named.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146714400252899328)

So you're saying RJ never threw names in a parenthetical. That may be.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146714712200056833)

I don't mean to defend for the sake of defending, but when someone complains about something Brandon does that RJ did, it's irksome.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146714993646243840)

I understand. I wasn't even trying to compare to RJ, except the quantity of fan names used. I felt like it was quantity...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146715104468144128)

...that led to situations like the two examples I gave. A desire to fit in more fan names.

#### [TOMAS BERGSTRÃ¶M](http://twitter.com/tomp115/status/146717650473598976)

The word "irksome" is that often used in daily English or a more history/fantasy word used in such lit? (work related inj)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146717789451845632)

It's a fairly common word.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146715851414966274)

For the most part I'd say Brandon is only naming characters he thinks RJ would have named. Not to fit in fan names just to fit in.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146716038669668352)

He goes to the list only when he needs a name. He doesn't pick out names first and then try to fit them in somewhere.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146716126288674819)

Except for the top auction winners of course.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146716407776804866)

I find it hard to see how names were needed in those two places.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146716703450083328)

If he thinks RJ would have named them, then that counts as "needed."

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146716970660790273)

Even in later drafts sometimes Maria or Harriet would say "give this character a name" when Brandon hadn't already.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146715459549536257)

Some people complained about names Brandon made up in
*The Gathering Storm*
. You can't please everyone. :)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146716683023822848)

You can't please everyone, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to do the best you can. Especially when you constantly...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146716834052308993)

...go out of your way to reassure fans that it is important to you to uphold this legacy. Small details do matter.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146717016265465859)

That line is often used when you're doing something that will please some and upset others. This isn't such a case.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146717168862629888)

Yup. Giving random characters names is a small detail that matters to Brandon because it mattered to RJ.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146717443270770688)

I'm not complaining about giving random characters names. You keep trying to paint it that way, though. Why?

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146717915595550721)

You keep trying to paint this as something RJ didn't do. Why? Maybe you can prove he didn't name characters in parentheticals.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146718186212048896)

I think the way Brandon is doing it is fine and basically the same as the way RJ did it. You disagree.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146718188359524355)

Did you just ask me to prove a negative? Really? LOL. Maybe you can find an example where he did the same thing.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146718396111798272)

It's not worth it to me to try that.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146718313295249409)

If you're wondering why some fans are getting increasingly frustrated with this process, then this is why.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146718424784052224)

We have bent over backward to be supportive of Brandon in cases where our support was dubious. But the minute we have...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146718567512014848)

...a criticism of any sort, we get defensiveness. Not 'filed, taken into consideration'. But 'you're imagining things'.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146718947511779330)

And yes, this [re: Peter's last tweet] is becoming increasingly clear as well.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146718917237284865)

You see this as a much bigger deal than me, clearly.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146719199115485184)

WoT? Clearly. This issue? Worth a tweet to Brandon in the hopes that he will take it into consideration.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146719469643898882)

This issue. And maybe he will.

#### [MICHAEL D](http://twitter.com/ReleaseTheEvil/status/146717013916651521)

I think we can just concede that the author has the freedom to do what he pleases with the naming of characters?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146717713216184321)

I think everyone is aware that Brandon has that freedom. That's not the point.

#### [ERIC PETERS](http://twitter.com/ericpeters/status/146719674946682881)

Terez27's avatar does say "Serious Business"âare you surprised she'd see it as a bigger deal? lol

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146719826897928192)

Good point.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146719667136897025)

In my mind it's still something where Brandon is doing pretty much what RJ did.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146719732677083136)

It's not my job to go through every paragraph in the series to try to prove that.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146719981571284992)

No one ever said it was. Apparently it's your job to get defensive, though. Or is it? Next time, just make a note of it.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146720118850846720)

It sounds like you only want a non-response to anything brought up. "filed, taken into consideration" is a non-response.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146720626814619650)

It can be. If the issue isn't important to you/Brandon, I'd rather a non-response than a pointless argument.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146720633097699328)

I don't think that saying "This is basically what RJ did" is defensiveness. My first tweet to you just asked for clarification.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146720789704617986)

Yes, and I clarified, and you dismissed my clarification as irrelevant. Instantly.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146720756754153472)

Once I got the clarification I gave the "this is basically what RJ did" answer.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146721416283299840)

It takes two to make a pointless argument. I guess you're saying if I think something isn't important, I should say nothing.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146721749587869696)

I apologize to the folks who follow both me and @PeterAhlstrom. Done spamming your feed now. ;)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146722448044335104)

I'm sure it would have been a much different conversation in person. Twitter strikes again.

#### [FRUUU27](http://twitter.com/fruuu27/status/146729896893362176)

That's fine. Made my walk with the dog a lot more interesting!

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146730610843590657)

Don't you need to watch your step when you do that, instead of watching your phone?

#### [TOMAS BERGSTRÃ¶M](http://twitter.com/tomp115/status/146722455354998784)

I posed the "irksome-question" to let you know (in a subtle way, I hope) that people were "listening" out here.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146723115144200193)

heh, I was well aware from the beginning, and I'm sure Peter was as well.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146722644753002497)

Next time you can just say "Get a room, you two!" ;)

#### [LIRONAH](http://twitter.com/Lironah/status/146708885607170048)

I thought some of RJ's were fairly obvious. Paitr Conl, Jac, Bili, Joslyn, Jaim, Dannil, and 5 spellings of Alice.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146723558867992577)

Ya, though in this case the adapted forms weren't what the discussion was about. Some people have complained about those though.

#### [MICHAEL D](http://twitter.com/ReleaseTheEvil/status/146718868256198658)

[re:
[this tweet](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146718567512014848)
] I don't think he's saying that... Think he just doesn't see it the way other readers evidently do.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146722994348244994)

I do think Reader Response is the most relevant type of literary criticism.

#### [MICHAEL D](http://twitter.com/ReleaseTheEvil/status/146723292470968320)

Definitely. But felt that whole argument was a big misunderstanding. Felt bad.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146724588582211584)

More like a difference of opinion on a very minor issue.

#### FOOTNOTEâTEREZ

This isn't a minor issue because a very large number of fans have a serious problem with the auction just on principleâBrandon responds to some of them every now and then on Twitter (such as the guy who started this conversation; I didn't @ him in my response to Brandon for a reason), and Brandon's responses are included hereâbecause it favors fans who have more money (the more you donate, the greater your chance of being chosen, though the minimum is a small amount). When you have an issue that is already touchy like that, you have to be careful in how you handle it. Luckers and I were among Brandon's biggest defenders when he announced the name contest for
*Towers of Midnight*
. We pointed out
[Guybon](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#4)
before Brandon did. The complaints were even louder after the book came out, and at that point, the choice was much more difficult to defend. This type of usage is also a big disappointment to those whose names were chosen; they thought they'd won something exciting, but they're written in such a way that makes their names seem an afterthought. I doubt anyone expected to be a major character, but a little smoothing would have gone a long way.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146725391468466177)

I do apologize for coming off that way. It's really not my intent. Criticism is important to feel free to share.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146725860559433728)

Specifically I personally give your comments a lot of weight because I know you know your stuff.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146726814016999424)

Thanks. We know that Brandon has a tough job, and an awkward situation at best. But it's awkward for us too, in many ways.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146727360656445440)

It's a little difficult to be someone who knows more about WoT than the guy who is writing it, aside from the secret stuff...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146727510858678272)

...and to have to watch it all unfold from a rather passive position. I'm sure you understand. ;)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146727813288960000)

Point taken.

#### [FELIX](http://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/146728394317512704)

Chuckles, you can say that knowing about Terez's "Gawyn will kill Rand with
*Callandor*
theory"? Poke-poke.... ;o) [Not sure where Felix got the
*Callandor*
bit from.]

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146728849961533440)

Theories and a thorough working knowledge of what's actually in the books are separate things.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146733940370178048)

Note that in many of these cases, Harriet said to me "What are their names?" when I just wrote "Two Maidens."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146734153994469376)

Harriet always pushes me to be more specific. You'll find it in
*The Gathering Storm*
too, where I wasn't using fan names.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146734538163372032)

Yeah, I understand that muchâand sometimes, it works. I imagine that not all examples of Harriet asking...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146734657239658496)

...for such ended up with examples like I gave, where the names are thrown in parenthetically.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146734790207479808)

In the fan criticism I mentioned earlier, these cases were always the ones fans noticed. Even at DM...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146734983330017281)

...where the subject comes up every two weeks in a new thread, mentioned by different new users. [I should have said 'came up', because I was thinking about the period of a few months after the book came out, not recently. Also, crosstalk after this because Peter types faster than me so I was unprepared for the more stately tweeter, Brandon.]

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146734861883944960)

The examples you gaveâthough I only looked brieflyâcould have certainly been done better.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146734975771885568)

Probably, they should have just been "\*\*\* and \*\*\* went and did such and such" rather than the parenthetical.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146735226540929024)

Right, something along those lines. And again, those of us 'in the know' were probably bothered more by it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146735345420091392)

That's more of a prose issue than anything else, thoughâan area where RJ was very strong and I'm relatively weak.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146735587410456577)

Yes, I've noticed you have mentioned that
[before](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=516#4)
. Which is why I thought it worth a tweet. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146735998116696065)

We'll try to keep an eye on the issue. We should have more time on
*A Memory of Light*
than we did on
*Towers of Midnight*
for polishing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146736144112025600)

I don't \*Think\* we'll have a 'shoehorn in fan names' issue, since I have just left placeholders for names I need.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146736328023867392)

Every one of them is a name I'd have had to make up, but instead, I'll adapt a fan name.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146736463302758400)

Still, it's worth a look-over specifically for this issue.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146736288131850242)

Oh great. Now that Brandon responded, how much do I need to put in the Twitter archive post?! >\_<

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146736707922964480)

LOL. See, we share this burden. It should create a bond between us! And if you want to skip it I'll cover it. You can link ;)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146737258463109121)

Nah. I think there's a good splitting point I can use to keep it relevant to Brandon's reply. You can include whatever though. :)

#### [TOMAS BERGSTRÃ¶M](http://twitter.com/tomp115/status/146738008710856704)

Before you can link you both have to reach/open yourself for
*saidin*
/
*saidar*
. And who will control the weaves? ;)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146764341859987457)

I said 'bond', not 'link'. And I wasn't talking about the Warder bond either. ;)

#### [TOMAS BERGSTRÃ¶M](http://twitter.com/tomp115/status/146765630039793666)

Really look at the earlier tweet here then. You typed bond in a previous tweet also.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146766071582568449)

I meant link to the website. \*sigh\*

#### [TOMAS BERGSTRÃ¶M](http://twitter.com/tomp115/status/146766926864056320)

I know, but the best work was when men and women worked together with the power of the WoT ;)

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146736652449095680)

The fan names never hugely bothered me, but I do agree with Terez that they are noticeable.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146736888265441281)

I think because they feel more like blank spaces in the narrative than colouring in the scene by...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146736985745276928)

... Naming those present.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146737604296056832)

I'm somewhat more troubled by the treatment of fan criticism. This is about the fifth time I've...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146737980588036096)

...seen you do this Peter, with the same line: 'It's a problem in reader appreciation, not the writing.'

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146738282959601664)

And not everyone has Terez's tenacity or confidence, and thus allow themselves to be silenced.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146738576099524608)

And given I've seen you both cite the value of the lack of fan criticism in judging Brandon's efforts...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146738725383192577)

...yeah...It's a little disconcerting.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146738277620256769)

Maybe I should back off.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146739520489005057)

I think Brandon has recognized it, by responding. And we have played the silencers before, haven't we?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146741642261561344)

Peter is in a tough spot. I can easily say, "Yeah, I did a poor job on that one. I'll watch for it."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146741782133219328)

Peter, however, doesn't want to put words in my mouth, or apologize for me.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146742096009768960)

Instead, he seeks to defend me, since he knows I won't see most people's posts or be able to respond.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146746000097292290)

It may surprise you, but we felt the same way after the release of
*The Gathering Storm*
, despite not being fans.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146746606740455424)

I empathise, I just don't sympathise. Not after the way you've both held up a lack of fan [criticism]...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146747100691038208)

...as validation for your work on the Wheel. It's a circle, the lack of criticism held up as proof...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146747299748515840)

...whilst the act of criticism is met with sweeping dismissal that most would never argue.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/146751133497573376)

Point taken as well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146759754264481793)

Makes me curious which criticisms you're referring to. I wouldn't mind if you emailed them to me.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146759872187346945)

So I can be aware of which ones the fans feel we aren't listening to.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/146775456924958720)

Will do. :)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146760409016315906)

I think both Luckers and I have really tried to strike a balance over these last few years between...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146760556337053696)

...defense for the sake of support and criticism for the sake of criticism. I will email you.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146760764659732480)

(In other words, most fan response seems to fall under one of the two categories.)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146761047867535361)

I will admit most things I care about aren't things most fans would care about. Maybe scholars.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146761205988593664)

But that's assuming scholars ever take an interest in the WoT. ;)

#### [JOENITA SCANNELL](http://twitter.com/willowy/status/146826434965536768)

Terez seems a little full of herself and I resent the fact that she seems to think she speaks for all fans.

#### [JOENITA SCANNELL](http://twitter.com/#!/willowy/status/146827560733511681)

Most fans love the books for what they are & don't pick them apart to show off.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146864910155001856)

[hours later, after a nap] Who ever said anything about me speaking for all fans? Now you sound like the guy who said he 'lost all respect'...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146865008142323712)

We're aware that most fans don't give a shit about the fine details. I never claimed to be most fans.

#### [JASON ROSTAR](http://twitter.com/jbrstr/status/146775488088641537)

These kind of criticisms I find ridiculous and over the topâGuess I'm just too casual.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146865398451683328)

It's only ridiculous and over the top when it turns into a stupid argument.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/146955470693867520)

I woke up on the wrong side of Twitter today. Sorry about that.

#### (Months Later)

  

#### [TEREZ (30 May 2012)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/207888630902034435)

"Even heâJori, bonded to Morvrinâmanaged it." #wotrr (

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/207900369781657602)

Remind me what brought it up.

I favorited his tweet, and moved on.
