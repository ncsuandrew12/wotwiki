## [Entry #1](./t-249/1)

#### Bluecole

Whew!! 14 something hours and 600 miles. I'm tired.

Anyway, here are the big things I learned at the signing:

## [Entry #2](./t-249/2)

#### Robert Jordan

While RJ was on the west coast, he looked over and approved an outline for the screenplay for
*The Eye of the World*
. He expects to have the script on his desk in about eight weeks.

## [Entry #3](./t-249/3)

#### Robert Jordan

He has said previously that he will not write any more books in the WoT universe once he finishes the main storyline, plus the two "outrigger" prequel novels. Tonight, he amended that and said (paraphrase), "I won't write in this universe again unless I have a great idea. Well, I think I have had that idea, but it will take me a while (a year or two) to poke and prod it to see if it is worth writing."

## [Entry #4](./t-249/4)

#### Bluecole

Before I went, I asked everybody what questions to ask.

## [Entry #5](./t-249/5)

#### Emma

How did Be'lal recognize that Moiraine is intending to use balefire against him before Moiraine released the balefire? And how did Moiraine sense the balefire Rand used?

#### Robert Jordan

RJ responded with the most emphatic "RAFO" of the evening. Jumped all over it, in fact. So I think that says several things, but that's another thread.

## [Entry #6](./t-249/6)

#### Bluecole

So that's all the big stuff . . . but here's a bit more.

#### Robert Jordan

He & Harriet will produce an encyclopedia after the main series is done.

## [Entry #7](./t-249/7)

#### Robert Jordan

You CANNOT reach the Tower of Ghengei through the Portal Stones. (direct from RJ)

## [Entry #8](./t-249/8)

#### Robert Jordan

I heard that he has reversed his position on telling us who killed Asmodean (after the paperback of
*A Memory of Light*
comes out). This was NOT confirmed by RJ.

#### Footnote

It was confirmed in previous signings on the
*Knife of Dreams*
tour that RJ would look for a place to include the reveal in
*A Memory of Light*
, and if he was not able to find a suitable place, he would reveal the killer after the release of the paperback of
*A Memory of Light*
.

## [Entry #9](./t-249/9)

#### Robert Jordan

The theory that Demandred is using balefire at the direction of the Dark One to loosen the weave of the Pattern is squashed by RJ. (confirmed)

#### Footnote

This person is not clear whether the theory was 'squashed' or 'confirmed', but in any case, we discussed it with Brandon
[here](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#36)
, and it seems as though RJ confirmed it.

## [Entry #10](./t-249/10)

#### Bluecole

Okay, that's all I can remember at this point...more may come to mind after I get some rest. Anything else he said, he said before.

#### Robert Jordan

No male nudity. He will punch the first person to ask who killed Asmodean. No comment on boxers/briefs. However, he didn't go thru the list of pronunciations, kinda a surprise. Did prompt the women for questions.

## [Entry #11](./t-249/11)

#### Bluecole

I will post pictures when I get them.

Thanks, B.

EDIT::
  
I got all my books signed....all the WoT, the Big Ehite Book, two of the Fallon series, and my two Russian 1st ed.

RJ & harriet are the coooolest.
