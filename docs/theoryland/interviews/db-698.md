## Entry #1

#### [atheistcanuck (21 Mar 2011)](https://twitter.com/atheistcanuck/status/49636721381486592)

The Almighty's original name was Tanavast, yes/no?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49639631238598656)

Yes and no. The concept of the "Almighty" in Roshar has a lot of meanings, many of them wrong.

#### [ATHEISTCANUCK](https://twitter.com/atheistcanuck/status/49639901079150592)

But the person who held the Shard Honor was originally named Tanavast?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49647539623952384)

Yes. You wiggled it out of me. That was the name of the original holder of the Shard Honor

## Entry #2

#### Chaos

So Aona is a synonym for love, hmm? Is Charity the correct Shard name?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not quite. I'm trying to remember what the guesses were for the other Shard on Sel. I may have dismissed them too quickly.

#### CHAOS

How about Mercy for Aona, then? The guesses for Skai's Shard include Devotion, Obedience, and Order.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Okay, I was right, then. Ha There's something very ironic in all of this.
