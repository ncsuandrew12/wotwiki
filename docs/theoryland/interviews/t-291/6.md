For Lelon White, getting off the heavy drugs for a month is a dream. Take all the advantage you can. Missing Patrick Stewart in the Tempest is a heavy price. No thoughts of trying to reschedule the doctor? Or doing what I call a ball-pein hammer reschedule? "Gee, doc, I wrote it down, and I could have sworn the appointment was for today, not yesterday." It works. It works. And Stewart, in any Shakespeare, is not to be missed.
