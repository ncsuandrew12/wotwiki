# [Interview #291: Robert Jordan's Blog: A Little Update, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=291#4)

#### Robert Jordan

For SSG Travis Kennedy, thank you very much, both for passing your story along to me—frankly, I never imaged one of my books saving anyone's life, and I have passed your story on to various people under the title DO YOU STILL THINK I SHOULD WRITE SHORTER BOOKS?—and for the work you are now doing with our wounded undergoing rehab. Thank you doubly, for your service in the Sand, and for your service now.
