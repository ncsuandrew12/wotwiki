#### Robert Jordan

My thanks for Mr. Robert C. Fertig for his donation to the Mayo Hematologic Malignancies Programâ€”Amyloidosis Research. Every penny is a help toward finding a cure for this condition, which is usually fatal. It looks very like I am dodging the bullet, but then, it seems that I am become Ganesh again, and if you will forgive me mixing metaphors, once again the baraka is with me and rides my shoulder. Most people don't have my luck.
