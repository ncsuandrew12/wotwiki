## [Entry #1](./t-657/1)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked what happened to [Sheriam's] Warder at Elf Fantasy, and got a RAFO, as I'd pretty much expected, but I had to try :) I asked "I know this is probably going to be a RAFO, but I really wonder if you forgot about him." RJ did laugh and almost seemed to hesitate as he answered, but I don't know if that meant that he did forget about that one small appearance in
*The Fires of Heaven*
when he wrote the
*Path of Daggers*
scene, or maybe it was because I admitted I kinda expected RAFO, or what.

## [Entry #2](./t-657/2)

#### Myranya

There is one thing I learned from RJ's tour in the Netherlands. I never believed Sheriam was a Black by choice, but I used to consider her being turned to the Shadow as a valid option. Perhaps that would leave her not completely willing to find out as much as she could (letting Siuan do a lot of the work). Also, since she was the one who told Egwene about the turning being possible, she would be a prime candidate plot-wise. Yet
[one question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=135#38)
asked at an online chat held while he was here...Unless RJ is
*really*
trying to throw us off (which is possible ::grin::), this means that he hasn't used it yet, not turning anyone 'off-screen'. For now, I'm convinced Sheriam isn't a Black at allâ€”voluntary or involuntary. :)

Myranya.
