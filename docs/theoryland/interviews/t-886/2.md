, and in the rotunda on the first floor, Special Collections had a small display case of materials from the recently donated James O. Rigney Jr. papers as part of a larger display on the third floor. Also on display were reproductions of Rand's red coat, an Asha'man coat with a Wheel of Time sword pin, and an Aiel warrior complete with spear and shield provided by Museum Replicas. Hunter Wentworth was on hand showing portions of

, his documentary on the life of Robert Jordan, as well as filming the event for inclusion in the final cut of his movie. The Memory Keepers were also present handing out numbered tickets for people wanting books signed, answering questions, and getting to spend a little personal time with Harriet and Brandon, Maria, and Alan before the signing.
