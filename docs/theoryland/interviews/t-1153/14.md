#### Question

Will we get a more comprehensive Ars Arcanum in the Arcanum Unbounded?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends… there will be cool things in there, but I don’t think they’ll count as “Ars Arcanum” exactly. It’ll be more focused on maps and things like that. There’ll be a star chart for each world.
