#### Kurkistan

How broadly can a time-bubbler control the attributes of the bubble? Like could he make it ten times smaller to make it ten times more powerful?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is more controllable than I have generally shown in the books.

#### Kurkistan

And does the size correspond inversely to the strength?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.
