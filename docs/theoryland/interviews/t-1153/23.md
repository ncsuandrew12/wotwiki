# [Interview #1153: Calamity-Chicago, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1153#23)

#### Kurkistan

So when that cork [in Bands of Mourning] was thrown above the train, if the cork had been thrown by someone who was standing \_besides\_ the train, what would have happened when the bubble hit [the cork]? So the bubble's moving at 60mph and the cork [is not moving laterally relative to the bubble] and gets hit by a bubble...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right. Right right right... So... this one's complicated. Let me see if I can... So anything that touches the bubble will be immediately lodged into the bubble, and be hit by that... So say you throw something up, the bubble hits it, is that what you're asking?

#### Kurkistan

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But it does not have "momentum" the same as the thing? So it would probably be in the bubble for a short time.

#### Kurkistan

So if I threw the cork straight, and then the bubble came from the right, the cork would shift to the right within the bubble as the bubble thought it was moving or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Kurkistan

So the bubble thinks the cork is travelling like 60mph North, the cork thinks it's not moving at all...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah...

#### Kurkistan

So does the cork move the opposite direction of the bubble or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ask Peter the math on that one, and I'll have him run the math. That one's kind of... it's kind of like the time travel train experiment stuff, with the flags and things. So let's go ahead and PAFO that one.
