#### Question

With safehand culture, with one hand feminine, two hand masculine: is knitting considered masculine?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Knitting is not one of the prime arts, and so it would be considered either direction. Itâ€™s not one of the major arts, so men can knit their socks and things like that at war and not have to feel feminine, but women could knit if they wanted to, also.

#### Question

Okay. So, Dalinar can make baby socks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Dalinar can make baby socks and not feel- (we were walking away at this point, he stopped talking).
