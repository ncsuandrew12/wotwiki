#### Argent

Returned, they don’t quite fit the other splinters—their Breath, rather—because it’s the divine breath that’s the splinter right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ehhhhhhh…. Ehhhhhhh....

#### Argent

Okay, that was vague.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not a 100% correlation there

#### Argent

So in that case it’s not entirely fair to say that the Returned are vessels for...

#### Brandon Sanderson

No… Well, more vessels than the people that are in T’Telir… So, Endowment is in control of what’s happening, right?

#### Argent

The giving of \_\_\_\_\_

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. So what you’ve got to remember—and this is something that people keep mistaking is- something like a spren is still part of the god, and it’s not that different from the fact that the rock has a part of the body in it, and that everything is kind of made—in [the] Mistborn world in particular—everything is made out of their essence. And so… the breath \_are\_ similar, but it’s less that- they’re not autonomous in most cases and it’s more like- it’s like a hybrid of what’s happening in Mistborn where everybody’s got a bit of Preservation in them. Everyone’s got a bit of Endowment in them.

#### Argent

Innate investiture.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Innate investiture that they are born with.

#### Argent

I was looking to \_Divine\_ Breath, \_\_\_\_\_ specifically.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh \_Divine\_ breath! Divine Breath is it’s own special thing, and it’s more like what happened with the Honorblades, in that the god is pouring a bit of its investiture, infusing the magic \_\_\_\_.
