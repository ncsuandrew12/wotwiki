# [Interview #1153: Calamity-Chicago, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1153#29)

#### Question

Have we seen the world mirrored by the Expanse of Broken Sky?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(long grunting and contemplation) I’m not answering that, RAFO

#### Question

What does First of the Sun look like on the Cognitive Realm? I think it’s a whole bunch of grubs, or worms.

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, c’mon you know I’m not gonna reveal Cognitive Realm on the other ones.

#### Question

The Expanse of Vibrance… Nalthis?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(more grunting) You would be making a good guess, if you said that. That’s an informed guess.

#### Argent

That’s not an answer, keep pushing.

#### Question

Is the only reason that Yolen is not reachable, according to Khriss, because it doesn’t have any sentience on it thinking of it as a planet, so it doesn’t appear in the Cognitive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ahh, no. Good question, but no.
