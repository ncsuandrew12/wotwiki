#### Question

At the end of Bands of Mourning, Wax begins seeing what seems like souls, as he’s holding the bands. He sees lines. He ponders that man/metals are the same thing. Is he seeing investiture there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, to an extent. Yes. He’s seeing the cosmere-equivalent of atoms/investiture/energy waves all being the same thing.

#### Question

Okay, so kind of a building block of things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes; it’s almost like he’s seeing the \_\_\_\_, the atoms.
