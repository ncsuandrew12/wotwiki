#### Kurkistan

How exactly does hemalurgic decay work for Feruchemy? Is it like a leaky tube or something, or…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah… yeah. (Here misunderstanding and thinking that the question’s about the power of the Feruchemy itself, not storing/tapping metalminds)

#### Kurkistan

So they try to store 10 units of health and only 9 gets through, or…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hemalurgic decay meaning someone who has been spiked is less powerful? That Hemalurgic decay] or the Hemalurgic decay when a Hemalurgic spike is left outside of blood?

#### Kurkistan

Less powerful. So like the Inquisitors are less powerful Feruchemists so they had to spend longer storing: so \_why\_ did they have to spend longer storing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah they lose a little bit, it’s a leaky… You’re there, exactly. It just doesn’t quite… it’s not as efficient: it’s [an] efficiency thing.
