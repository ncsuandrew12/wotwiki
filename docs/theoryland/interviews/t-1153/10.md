# [Interview #1153: Calamity-Chicago, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1153#10)

#### Question

I know you wrote the Eleventh Metal for the Mistborn Adventure Game. Of the other stories included in the expansions (Darzonâ€™s Story, Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania, and House of Tin and Ash), should they be considered canon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Eleventh Metal and Allomancer Jak are, the others are not.
