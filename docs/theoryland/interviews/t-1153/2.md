#### Question

What does Curiosity mean to you? We see Vin talking to Kelsier and developing trust just because she is curious. Same thing with Moash and Kaladin, so what is curiosity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think curiosity is one of the driving forces in the human experience. You read books because of curiosity, you watch shows because of curiosity. Almost everything we do, curiosity is a basic motivation. Itâ€™s kinda what makes us human.
