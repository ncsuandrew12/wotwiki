#### Alterodent

If a hermit were to take a whole lot of Cadmium and go off and live by himself, how far within a lifetime, reasonably, could he get into the future by essentially time-capsuling himself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Alterodent

Assuming they live to be 70 or 75.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They could get pretty far.

#### Alterodent

What would the savantism do to them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The savantism would probably allow them to get further… It’s completely reasonable… you can treat this like relativistic travel.
