#### Question

If a Kandra and a human were to have a baby, what would that baby be like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that right now… It would depend. The kandra would have to remain in human form, keep the same body, and then would give birth to a human. If it was a woman [human] with a man [kandra], it wouldn’t be that big of a deal, with a kandra. Does that make sense?

#### Question

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because when the kandra is in human form, they can identically recreate the bodily functions and things if they want to.
