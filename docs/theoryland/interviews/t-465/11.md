# [Interview #465: TGS Signing Report - Lexington, KY, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=465#11)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon says of the five Redarms that enter Hinderstap with Mat that the three that seem unaccounted for when everyone else escapes are not "forgotten" and their circumstances are RAFO. He also said that he appreciates the finding of continuity errors so that they can be corrected before books go to paperback, but they are an unavoidable part of the business. He doesn't like when authors ignore continuity on purpose, but understands accidents.

#### Footnote

This was corrected for the ebook and later editions.
