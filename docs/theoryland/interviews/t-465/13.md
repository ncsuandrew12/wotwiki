#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon admitted there would be overlapping chronology between
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
and that Graendal's name will be mentioned a few times.

Brandon said the progress of book completion is sometimes edited down and then up depending on the subtraction or addition of submitted content.
