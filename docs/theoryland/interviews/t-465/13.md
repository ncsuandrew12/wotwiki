# [Interview #465: TGS Signing Report - Lexington, KY, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=465#13)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon admitted there would be overlapping chronology between
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
and that Graendal's name will be mentioned a few times.

Brandon said the progress of book completion is sometimes edited down and then up depending on the subtraction or addition of submitted content.
