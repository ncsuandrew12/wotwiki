#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon, who is of the Latter Day Saints faith, was asked how he keeps his theology out of his books. He answers that a writer should not ram his ideology down the reader's throats. A good writer, he says, should present multiple perspectives and beliefs through his characters writing all arguments with equal strength, lest they carry less weight. He then says that Robert Jordan was once quoted saying, "I love when my books ask questions, I do not want to give answers." Another visitor also comments on Brandon's faith, praising that he's one of the only LDS authors he's read where you can't tell his faith through his writing.
