# [Interview #465: TGS Signing Report - Lexington, KY, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=465#6)

#### Question

I asked Brandon which WoT websites he peeked at.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that he tries not to go to them for fear of being drawn into discussions. He said that if he goes anywhere, it's usually Dragonmount. To Matt of Theoryland who said to say "Hi", Brandon says "RAFO". When I asked him about my old home of wotmania, he said that he had been there and they seemed to like to argue a lot. I had to concede that.
