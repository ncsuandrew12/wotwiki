## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#1)

#### AndrewB

I was at the Philly book signing last night. At some point I will post a summary of what Brandon & Harriet said prior to the Q&A, as well as the Q&As themselves. I took notes. I will try to do this later this week (probably either Friday evening or Saturday). RL will not allow me to do it any sooner. (BTW, I was not a Memory Keeper so I do not have that restriction.)

I was able to ask 2 questions: one during the Q&A, the other when I got my book signed. As a teaser here are those questions and answers.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#2)

#### AndrewB

Once a person pledges themselves to the Shadow (either voluntarily or involuntarily), are they always reborn as agents of the Dark?

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS first qualified that any answer he will give is as always subject to the caveat that it is subject to a subsequent unearthing of RJ's notes on the subject or an answer that RJ previously gave on the subject. BWS then stated that assuming that a soul was not transmigrated (for example the 'gars [I probably botched the spelling of this word]), then no. That person's soul is a blank slate.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#3)

#### AndrewB

How do Egwene, Nynaeve and Moiraine know Moridin's name? (Egwene mentions Moridin by name when talking to Rand at the meeting of the Field of Merrilor; Nynaeve and Moiraine each mention Moridin by name in respective POV while in Shayol Ghul.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS paused for at least 10 seconds before answering. He said that he thought he remembered answering this question before and did not want to give me a misleading answer. BWS said Rand told each of the 3 women Moridin's name in an off-screen conversation.

#### AndrewB

I will leave the commenting of these answers to others (although I have some opinions about them—especially the answer to the second question).

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#5)

#### [AndrewB ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-memory-of-light-tour-report-open-thread#324028)

Here is my summary of what Brandon (BWS) and Harriet (HM) talked about at the Philadelphia book signing and the Q&A session. I will only briefly touch upon the areas that BWS and HM talked about. (I believe it was stated that the session was recorded on would eventually be posted on the web site for the Public Library of the City of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania). However, do not take this as an affirmative assurance). When BWS walked on stage (this portion of the book signing was in the auditorium of the Philadelphia Public Library) he was wearing a black T-shirt with the blacksmith puzzle icon.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#6)

#### AndrewB

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He explained how he first got interested in the fantasy genre (his first fantasy book was
*Dragonsbane*
). He then preceded to tell how he discovered
*The Eye of the World*
and how he became a fan of the series. BWS then described how he wanted to become a professional writer.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS then went into the story of his response to RJ's passing, describing what he wrote about RJ on his blog and what RJ meant to BWS (despite not knowing the man personally).

#### Harriet McDougal

HM continued from her perspective. She informed the audience about how she came to read BWS' eulogy of RJ. It was the way he wrote and what he wrote that led her to initially believe that BWS would be the ideal type of person and writer to finish WoT. She also told the story about how she attempted to first contact BWS and wound up calling the other Brandon Sanderson in Provo, Utah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS next told the audience about the time he first read RJ's notes. BWS informed us that there were about 200 pages of notes on the last book. Roughly 100 pages of these notes comprised dictations of scenes/paragraphs. The other 100 pages were from Q&As among RJ, Alan and Maria.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#8)

#### AndrewB

Afterwards the Q&A began. Below is a summary of most of the questions asked and the answers from BWS and/or HM.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#9)

#### Question

How has BWS' answer evolved since he started finishing the WoT?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

[I believe a summary of this answer would not properly capture BWS' response.]

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#10)

#### Question

Which WoT character did BWS take the most liberties with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Androl. BWS told the story of how he asked HM if there was a character for which the notes did not have a role for and if BWS could make his. HM was receptive to the idea. One of them (I cannot remember who) mentioned that RJ had in his notes material on leatherworking. HM had asked BWS if he could incorporate this into the books. BWS felt it would be perfect for Androl.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#11)

#### Question

Why did we not see
*cuendillar*
made into chain mail or shields?

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS does not know if something like this was ever done at some point in the history of WoT.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#12)

#### Question

What was BWS' favorite miserable situation in
*A Memory of Light*
?
p

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was a tie. The scene at the end of the Last Battle Chapter (the 200 page chapter) and the scene in the garden at night concerning the character BWS likes to put in miserable situations. (BWS phrased the answer in this manner due to a no spoiler rule.)

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#13)

#### Question

How does BWS manage to distinguish his own style and writings from WoT?

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS jumps between different materials/works as a means of taking a break. In other words he could not write the WoT novels (or his own for that matter) from beginning to end without working on unrelated writings. That said, BWS did mention the horror (his word) of writing both
*Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
simultaneously. This is why he could not work on the second book of the Stormlight Archive series until he completed
*A Memory of Light*
.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#14)

#### Question

HM was asked how, as an editor, it was to work with BWS? Also how was working with BWS different from other authors and RJ?

#### Harriet McDougal

She stated that by the middle of the series, she would give RJ "curb-side edits" (her phrase) or if there was a "big problem." With BWS, it was a new author, but these were old characters. One of them told the story that she made the same edit for both RJ and BWS (
~~he noticed~~
that she is wearing...). Also, either BWS or HM told the story of the Aviendha/Elayne edit comment (that the Aviendha that BWS wrote was a great Elayne).

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#15)

#### Question

Regarding planned future WoT outriggers.

#### Harriet McDougal

An emphatic no. However, HM did say there will be an encyclopedia (the original contract was signed with a due date in 2008). HM expects that it will take most of 2013 to put together and then some additional time to have illustrated. At this point, HM thinks it will not be out until late 2014 at the earliest.
