# [Interview #948: AMOL Signing Report - Mason Wheeler, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=948#1)

#### Mason Wheeler

I was there too [the Seattle signing], and I asked a few Cosmere questions. I didn't record any of this, and what I'm reporting here, both in my questions and his answers, (particularly his answer to the first question) are kind of paraphrased, but this is accurate enough. (Note: Mistborn and
*Way of Kings*
spoilers ahead.)
