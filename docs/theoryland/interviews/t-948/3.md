# [Interview #948, Entry #3]: AMOL Signing Report - Mason Wheeler](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=948#3)

#### Mason Wheeler

So, according to King Taravangian, the... erm... I don't actually know the name for it, the uh, death-babbling phenomenon...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Death rattles.

#### Mason Wheeler

OK, death rattles have been going on since about the time the Parshendi were first discovered. Soon after this, King Gavilar was killed, and he said something that sounds kind of nonsensical. Was that him talking, or someone else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that was Gavilar.
