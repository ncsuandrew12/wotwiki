# [Interview #948: AMOL Signing Report - Mason Wheeler, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=948#2)

#### Mason Wheeler

You've said that Splintering a shard is essentially the same thing as the shattering of Adonalsium, repeated on a smaller scale.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Mason Wheeler

And a while ago, someone asked you if Splintering was permanent or reversible, and you said that it can be reversed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Mason Wheeler

And shard holders tend to take the name of the shard they hold. So you've got Sazed, who goes by "Harmony" now, after taking up Ruin and Preservation. That makes me wonder, does he hold two shards... or one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You could really answer that either way. The distinction is a really subjective one, and you could say that he's holding both shards, or that he holds one single Harmony.
