## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#1)

#### Viper

Hi guys!

Quick intro:
  
I've been reading Brandon's books for about a year, and a few months ago I noticed some stuff about his novels. I googled "Hoid" and "Adonalsium" and holy crap what did I find! It felt like I took a bead of what I now know is called "lerasium".

So anyway, I had tried to read up on stuff on this forum and coppermind, etc, but I am still behind on knowing everything that's ever been asked/revealed. That in mind, I went to a signing he had tonight in Milford NH (middle of nowhere, right?) and asked him some questions. I also asked if I could post the answers he gave me online, and am respecting his wishes as to what can be said. While there I also met another Sanderson nerd (San-nerd-son?) who I discussed some things with to get his view. I had a list of questions and wrote down Brandon's answers. Forgive me if any of them have already been answered ...

It took me 2 turns through the line to get all my questions answered. All statements are approximations and not direct quotes.

#### Viper

Hi Brandon. Thanks for this ... I have like a billion questions so I'll go through the line as many times as needed to ask them all.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No problem. Why don't we try to answer some now?

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#3)

#### Viper

Hah. So in Cosmere, does physics work the same way in the physical realm as it does in our world? Specifically, particle physics; and are atoms made up of protons and neutrons and electrons, and is light photons, etc?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Viper

So what's at the core of an atom of Atium? Ate-teum? Also how do you pronounce it? At-teum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. And the matter is just normal matter, but it's wrapped in the spiritual. The Spiritual DNA [or something] is what makes it magical.

#### Viper

(Note: he might've said slightly more about this but I didn't write it down and I don't remember. Sorry for not bringing a tape recorder :(/> )

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#4)

#### Viper

Ok. The gemhearts/stormgems/whatever that are grown inside the beasts in
*Way of Kings*
... is that the same as the way Atium is grown inside geodes in the Pits of Hathsin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's similar. The pits are an area where there's like a leak from the spiritual realm into the physical. That's what happens there.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#5)

#### Viper

Ok real quick then I'll get back in line again. There's a bunch of people who follow this stuff online ... I just found out about it ... I don't want to call them a cult, but ... So anyway, at one point someone asked you if Seons were shards of—

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aona.

#### Viper

Devotion ... yeah Aona, and you said that was close. My question is: are the Aons at the HEART of the Seons shards of Devotion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but close.

#### Viper

But ... I was sure ... the floating Aon at the heart, that's not a shard ...

#### Brandon Sanderson

(taking pity on me) You're close but a word is wrong. You're using the wrong terminology.

#### Viper

SPLINTER. Are the Aons at the heart of Seons SPLINTERS of Aona?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Viper

Can I post that online?

#### Brandon Sanderson

. . . Ok. That's fine. It's been long enough, they've earned it.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#6)

#### Viper

... Then I waited around 2 hours for another turn, this time with the other dude & his girlfriend. There was another girl there too, so the 4 of us were asking him questions. I don't remember any questions other than the ones I came up with, so they'll have to chime in with the questions they had.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#7)

#### Viper

Aons look like Arelon; soulstamps look like MaiPon. Aons get weaker when you get further from Arelon, right? That's not just cause Elantris acts like a focus?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's right, it's based on distance. That's why there are no stamped objects in Elantris.

#### Viper

So do soulstamps get weaker further from MaiPon? If you left Sel via Shadesmar and went to another planet, would the soulstamp stop working?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's correct.

#### Viper

Could soulstamps be carved that used Arelon as a base form instead of MaiPon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's very interesting, isn't it?

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#8)

#### Viper

You said that the Pits are a leak from the spiritual into the physical—

#### Brandon Sanderson

A necessary leak.

#### Viper

Ok. Are the spren a similar leak but from the Cognitive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The next book is going to explore the spren a lot further.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#9)

#### Viper

Wyrn can see into the future ... is he a follower of Dominion or of Odium? Cause Dominion is shattered, so ...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dominion.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#10)

#### Viper

Are we going to find out soon if the Parshendi are actually of Honor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. (You'll find out.)

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#11)

#### Viper

Hoid has a nugget of Lerasium and the Moon Scepter. Does he have a Breath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It seems quite likely that he would.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#12)

#### Viper

This will probably be RAFO'd, but: Is Szeth bound to a spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. He's not. Haha, I didn't RAFO that.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#13)

#### Viper

Question about timelines—Was Honor splintered BEFORE or AFTER the day of recreance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I'm going to RAFO that for now.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=949#14)

#### Viper

That was all that we asked him ... he seemed tired, so we didn't want to push it. Afterwards, I still had a few questions, but I didn't want to be an asshole to him.

My theory now involves Szeth being bound to his oathstone the way Kaladin is bound to Syl; I believe Honor was splintered near Urithiru (which was built "to the west, near Honor"), and I believe that this may have been in Shinovar. That's how he learned the lashings, etc. But we'll see.

Ok, that's it for now. I'll let you know if I remember anything else ...

Peace.

~Viper.
