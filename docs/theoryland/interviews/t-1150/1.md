#### FeatherWriter

Is something wrong with Roshar's afterlife?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, why do you ask?

#### FeatherWriter

Because of the Tranquiline Halls stuff? Needing to reclaim them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um. So, I'm... not going to answer anything about Roshar's afterlife.

#### FeatherWriter

Kay, alright.
