# [Interview #994: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: JordanCon Swag, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=994#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Matt Hatch from Theoryland brought me a shirt and art print with a symbol based on the Dusty Wheel from
*Towers of Midnight*
. As a cool side note, the pipe drawing is based on one of Robert Jordan's actual pipes. If you're interested in buying one of these shirts, they're available at
[InkWing](http://store.inkwing.com/)
. (Also note that
[Ta'veren Tees](http://store.inkwing.com/)
has many types of Wheel of Time shirts.)
