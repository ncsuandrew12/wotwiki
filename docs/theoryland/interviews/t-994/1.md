# [Interview #994, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: JordanCon Swag](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=994#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I got back from JordanCon a few days ago. Often times at cons and signings, my readers bring me small gifts. I'm deeply grateful for the time and thought put into these, and I try to post pictures of some of them from time to time. JordanCon was no exception. Here are some of the cool things you all gave me.

A highlight of the con for me was going to lunch with one of my idols, Michael Whelan. (For more on how much I love his work,
[see here](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/03/michael-whelan-an-apreciation)
.) He gave me one of the signed limited editions of
*The Art of Michael Whelan*
, which includes a beautiful original illustration (below). The book and the illustration are absolutely gorgeous. I can't wait to see what Michael comes up with for the cover of
*Words of Radiance*
.
