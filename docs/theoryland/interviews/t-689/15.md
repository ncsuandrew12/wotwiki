Can a Drab Return?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A Drab can not Return as the Returned are known, and there are things about the Drab that are not completely understood. But a Drab without a Breath, itâ€™s going to be very hard. Drabs do not Return. Good question, by the way. No one has ever asked me that before.
