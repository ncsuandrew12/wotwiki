#### Question

With all the books you have planned, how many years of your life do you have planned out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m intending to live till my 90’s probably, and I’ve got enough books for two books a year until then. (laughter) But I also write quickly, so you’ll get books consistently and hopefully they’ll be funny and interesting. I really do try to work hard to make sure that they are each a self-contained story. The place where I stop doing that is in the last chapter and epilogue, where I really like to punch you, and I’m sorry, it’s just some sort of instinct that I have. It’s like “Oh, everything’s wrapped up—NO IT’S NOT!” (laughter) So I’m sorry about that.
