#### Question

What’s your favorite fantasy/scf characters that you haven’t written?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excluding my books and the wheel of time, Sam Vimes from the Discworld books, I really, really like. I have a strong affection for Harry Dresden. I really am fond of Lesa from
*Dragon Riders. Dragon Riders*
was one of the early books that I really really liked. Let’s see, who else. That guy from
*Dragon Prince. Dragon Prince*
is one of my favorite all-time books. Who else? Who else is good characters? The Fool from the Assassin books by Robin Hobb that she wrote is really awesome. That’s a good place for you. I would like to say Kvothe, because I love those books, but I don’t think he and I wouldn’t get along. I love the books and think that Kvothe is a jerk, and that’s part of why I love
*Name of the Wind*
, because Kvothe is kind of a jerk.
