#### Question

What do you do to keep yourself from burning out? What do you do to decompress?

I play with my Magic Cards. (Laughter) I go and sort them, I go build a deck.

#### AUDIENCE MEMBER

Roll around in them.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No! I can’t do that! Then they get bent. (More Laughter) That’s basically what I do.
