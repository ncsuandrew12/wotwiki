# [Interview #689, Entry #5]: Alloy of Law Midnight Release](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=689#5)

#### Question

When will we see a Hoid book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’ll be a little while. He’s playing around with things in the Stormlight Archive if you couldn’t tell, he’s decided to—Hoid is fiddling with things, more than he usually does. But Hoid as a major part of things doesn’t really show up till the third Mistborn trilogy, which is the outer space Mistborn, the sci-fi Mistborn.

If you didn’t know, Mistborn was pitched to my editor as a trilogy of trilogies. I told him I wanted to do a trilogy of epic fantasy books, then the same world in a modern setting, which we’re not to yet, but it’s going to be Allomancers in the 21st century-equivalent technology. It’s an urban fantasy series. Then I wanted to do a Science Fiction series in the same world, using the Epic Fantasy world as kind of a mythology to this new world, and the magic system becoming the means of Space Travel.

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

Whaaa?!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

And so that’s how I pitched Mistborn to my editor.

*Alloy of Law*
is actually a deviation from that, because I didn’t want people to forget about Mistborn, I wanted them to keep reading Mistborn, so I wanted them to keep releasing things, and we’ll eventually get to that second trilogy—

Hey there you are Mark! I heard you got number one.

#### MARK

Yep.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You’re crazy (laughter). You’re awesome though. He even beat the
17thshard
people, which is really a hard thing to do. (oohs and aahs) Two hours. Beat them by two hours.

So
*Alloy of Law*
I wanted to set up things for the second trilogy. I didn’t want to do the second trilogy yet, because the second trilogy, like the first trilogy is kind of bigger books, with a very involved storyline evolved across three books, and I didn’t want to be releasing that parallel to Stormlight Archive, which is the same sort of thing. Very evolved books where you tie a lot of things together, and so I wanted a series of Mistborn novels that were more independent.

*Alloy of Law*
is intended to be a “read it, have fun.” Eventually I may end up doing more with those characters, but when I do, you won’t have to remember that much about this one. It’s not like you have to remember a cast of 500 characters. You can just keep track of the main characters. They’re more of an episodic adventure. I kind of imagine
*Alloy of Law*
being—I’m not totally sure how to describe it. It’s like you have the giant movie that comes out, and then you have a TV show that’s based off of it, and then another big movie series, or something like that, if that makes any sense.

So that’s what
*Alloy of Law*
is. So Hoid is very involved in the third Mistborn trilogy, he’s also very involved in
*Dragonsteel*
, which is actually the first book in the sequence, long before
*Elantris*
happened. So eventually I will tell that story. You can read a draft of it at the BYU library. It’s the only copy that I know of in existence. It’s almost always checked out. It’s my Honors thesis, and it’s not very good. It really is not very good, but basically it’s involving the ideas that eventually will become
*Dragonsteel*
once I write it again. But I stole the Shattered Plains and put them in Roshar instead because the fit better there.
