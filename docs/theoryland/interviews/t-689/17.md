#### Question

What’s the future for the Alcatraz books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am actually in negotiations right now to bring the
*Alcatraz*
books to Tor, because we want to recover them, and rerelease them. So it’s kind of in a little bit of a limbo until I can get it to Tor, they were at Scholastic, and we’re in negotiations. There’s some things that I very much like about Scholastic, but at this point we’re kind of want to have all of my books at the same publisher, so if we do that, we will do a rerelease with new covers, then I will do the last book.

#### QUESTION

How can you rerelease a book with a new cover when sometimes you have references in the book to the covers? [Alcatraz made reference to the cover]

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Then I can just add a little addendum to say that the rereleased cover makes sense.
