# [Interview #689: Alloy of Law Midnight Release, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=689#16)

#### Question

Who’s going to be the focus for the next
*Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I spent a long time deliberating this, and eventually, in my plotting, I came upon one of those moments where you’re “Ah, this is what I need to do”, so it is going to be Shallan. So the focus for the next book is Shallan, and half of you want it to be Dalinar, and half of you want it to be Shallan, Dalinar will get his book, Shallan will get her book, but there’s a funny story here. In my original outline, I named many of the books, like Dalinar’s is named
*Highprince of War*
. Shallan’s book was actually named after the book that Jasnah gives her, which is very thematically important to her. But then I started telling it to people, and they started laughing, because the book that Jasnah gave her is called the
*Book of Endless Pages*
(laughter).

So, I thought that was a really cool title, but apparently, that’s going to give the reviewers too much fuel. (laughter) So you can pretend in your head that it’s called that, but I’ll come up with a different name.

#### Footnote

Brandon has decided to call book 2 "Words of Radiance"
