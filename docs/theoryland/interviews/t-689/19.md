#### Question

Do you have particular Inspirations from classics that you brought in your books? I felt like Dalinar was heavily influenced by Constantine.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I did have a degree in English, and so I read lots of stuff, but my favorite classics are
*Moby Dick*
,
*Les Miserables*
, and depending on the day one of the Jane Austen books, it changes. And so those are definite influences. You can probably see some
*Les Mis*
influence, a lot of it, in the Mistborn books. There were several places where I kind of consciously let myself be influenced there. I wouldn’t say that Dalinar though. The thing is, I started writing Dalinar when I was 15. He was my first character. In fact, I posted at Tor.com when
*Way of Kings*
came out a page from my very first novel that I tried to write when I was 14, and it was really really bad, and it has Dalinar in it. He is one of the few characters that survived through all these years from maturing, growing, and things like this. The story of the brother of the king who dies, and the brother must decide: does he take control, or does he let his nephew take control. So a lot of things have influenced Dalinar, but I can’t point to one specific thing.
