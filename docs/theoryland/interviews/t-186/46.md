#### Wendell, Idaho

Do you have any plans for writing after this series is completed? If so, would you do another fantasy series or go for a different genre?

#### Robert Jordan

I've been thinking about what I want to write after WoT for about seven years now, maybe more. And I will be doing another fantasy series much more compact than The Wheel of Time. I know some of you will be happy to hear that. But it will be fantasy, definitely.
