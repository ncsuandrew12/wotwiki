#### Zaandam, The Netherlands

First of all, I really, really enjoyed
*New Spring*
(it has been on sale here for a few weeks). Thank you for such a fantastic novel! My question: In
*New Spring*
you said Edeyn would be allowed to call herself el'Edeyn if Lan died and she and Lan were not even married. Is Nynaeve allowed to call herself el'Nynaeve al'Meara, now she's married to Lan?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.
