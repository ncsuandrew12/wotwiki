#### Cheyenne, Wyoming

Is there anyone particular character that is your favorite or one you feel is more like you?

#### Robert Jordan

My favorite character is always who I'm writing at the moment, whether it's one of the good guys or one of the villains, because if I don't like that character more than any other, the character will not come across as real. As for who I think is most like me, Lan embodies the ideals that I aspired to growing up. While Perrin is, I think, most like me, on the other hand, my wife thinks I'm Loial.
