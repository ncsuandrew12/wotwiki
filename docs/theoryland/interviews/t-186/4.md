I'm sure you've been asked this many times but, here goes, will I live to read the end of the Wheel of Time series? I'm hoping for at least 20 more years of life. Will I make it?

Easily. It's not going to be that long. I very much hope to finish in two more main sequence books. It's not an absolute promise, but I'm very much hoping for it and I think I can do it.
