#### Arlington, Virginia

Is
*New Spring*
meant to be a sequel to the tenth book or does this stand on its own? There are still loose ends in the tenth volume which I hope you'll clear up in your next book in the Wheel of Time. I love your books!

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you.
*New Spring*
is not a sequel. It is a prequel. The events of
*New Spring*
take place about 20 years before the events of
*The Eye of the World*
.
