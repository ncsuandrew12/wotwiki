#### Baltimore, Maryland

After you finish with the WoT series, do you have any plans to continue the story with a series based on the Age of Legends and the events leading up to the Breaking or a series that takes place far in the future, perhaps in the next Age or the next Third Age?

#### Robert Jordan

No. When I have finished with this world, I will go on to something else.
