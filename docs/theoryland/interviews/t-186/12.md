#### Norfolk, MA

I know you've said you think you can finish in two more books, but there seems to be so much that needs to happen before the Last Battle. It seems like we're still in the middle of it all. Is that a fair assessment?

#### Robert Jordan

No, we're not in the middle. I hope I can finish in two more books. But you ought to realize that I will not be giving you an absolute completion. That is, the major storylines will be completed, but some of the minor storylines are not going to be completed, so that when you finish the last book, you will still have a sense that this world is alive and kicking and things are going on out there. It's always disturbed me to read a book where at the end all problems have been solved. And I get the feeling that this whole world needs to be kept under a bell jar somewhere to keep the dust off.
