#### Miami, FL

Is it easier to write fantasy, since there are no boundaries other than one's imagination?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, there are boundaries, and everything has to make sense. And it's not easy to take things that are unreal and which the reader knows are unreal and make them make sense. So I actually think it's probably harder to write fantasy than it is to write some other kinds of fiction.
