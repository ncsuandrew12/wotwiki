#### Delmar, NY

Besides your incredibly structured magic system, how would you say that your physics education has influenced your writing? Do you regret at all not taking English and writing classes in college instead?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I don't have any regrets about not taking college English courses. If you major in English, I believe you're well trained to teach English but not necessarily to use it. And my physics background also gave me a view of structure that I think has been very useful in writing.
