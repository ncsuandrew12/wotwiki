#### Hellertown, PA

I was in Iraq in '91 when I received a copy of
*The Eye Of The World*
. It was a spectacular read in the desertâ€”wonderful fun reading. You went to The Citadel. Why did you choose that school?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I went to The Citadel as a veteran student. And I was, frankly, going somewhere else, but Col. Bunch at The Citadel kept calling me after I came back the last time from 'Nam, and I went to talk to him, and he told me about the veterans' program there. And I knew they had a good reputation in engineering and the sciences, so I ended up going. I sometimes had the suspicion I might play football for them, but I was beyond that by that time.
