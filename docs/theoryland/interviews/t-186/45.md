#### Baltimore, Maryland

When I finished book 10, I was a little upset that Rand and his story line was barely mentioned or developed anymore. Not that book 10 wasn't incredible, but was the reason behind this to catch the other story lines up to the present time?

#### Robert Jordan

Not so much to catch them up, because that was the way it played out in my head. This was what needed to be done now.
