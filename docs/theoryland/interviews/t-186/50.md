#### Philadelphia, PA

Okay, let's talk turkey, lots of comparison to you and Tolkien as the legacy and the new master. How do you feel about all these suggestions flying about? You both are easily my two favorite authors of all time (with Douglas Adams edging in to a close second!)

#### Robert Jordan

I feel a little nervous about them and quite pleased. If you're talking the realm of high fantasy, being compared to Tolkien is like being a musician and being compared to Mozart. That's the good part. The bad part is, I'm not Tolkien I'm not trying to write like Tolkien. So one one hand I'm pleased, the other hand ambivalent.
