#### Allentown, PA

First off—LOVE your writing—amazing in all aspects. Question—How has the recent movement of fantasy from the traditional "geek" or "nerd" viewpoint to the mainstream affected YOUR personal views on the genre?

#### Robert Jordan

Not at all, really. I have always enjoyed fantasy, and I'm not certain that we have moved in the mainstream that much. There are a good many writers, from Doris Lessing to the magic realists, who write fantasy and they don't call it "fantasy," they call it simply "a novel," and they deny vehemently that they write fantasy at all.
