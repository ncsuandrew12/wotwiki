#### Paris, Ontario, Canada

Wow your books are great!!! But they are hard to find and buy! I was wondering where the best place to buy them would be?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I don't how the situation is in Canada. I know that in the U.S. any specialty shop that sells science fiction will have my books. And just about any bookstore at all will have copies on the shelves.
