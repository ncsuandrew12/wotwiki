#### Carbondale, IL

Are there any plans for a video game made about the WoT that would do the series justice as in a RPG?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, there is a computer game out from Legend GTI, but there are no plans for PlayStation or Gameboy or those things. If I were approached by somebody who does that sort of thing, I would be amenable to doing a contract for that.
