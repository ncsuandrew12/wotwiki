#### Neenah, Wisconsin

I was wondering when you got into pipe collecting?

#### Robert Jordan

Many years ago, when I was young, I smoked cigarettes and I decided to quit smoking cigarettes about 35 years ago, I guess. And that was easy enough, but after about six months of not smoking, I realized that I had become so used to having a cigarette in my hands that my hands felt awkward and I was always fiddling with things.

I bought my first pipe and I trained myself not to inhale, and it was, in the beginning, just to have something to hold in my hand.
