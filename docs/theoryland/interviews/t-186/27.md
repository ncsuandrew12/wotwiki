#### Laurel, MS

What is your favorite book(s) outside of WOT?

#### Robert Jordan

It would be very hard to point at one. My all-time favorite authors are Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, John D. MacDonald, Louis L'Amour and Robert Heinlein. And as far as people writing at the moment, I will buy any book written by John M. Ford, Neal Stephenson, Robert Holstock...there's a long list of people I will snatch up a book when I realize it's something of theirs I haven't read yet.
