#### Storrs, Connecticut

Did you get the name Robert Jordan from the novel
*For Whom The Bell Tolls*
? If so, Why?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I got the name Robert Jordan from making lists of names using my real initials and taking one name from one list and one from the other list. I took a pen name because I wanted to keep the sorts of books I wrote separate, and I wanted to write a novel about my experiences in Vietnam and I was going to put my real name on that.
