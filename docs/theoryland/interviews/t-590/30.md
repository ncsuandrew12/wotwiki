# [Interview #590: Tor Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#30)

In the
*Alcatraz*
series, Alcatraz is very worried about letting down so many people. Is this semi-autobiographical and perhaps speak to your fears of letting down the WoT fans? (maybe it's subconscious!)

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

If it is, it's subconscious. Remember, I wrote the first
*Alcatraz*
book in 2005, before even
*Mistborn*
was published. The only one that I wrote after the Wheel of Time decision was made was book four. The previous ones had been written already. So there probably is a subconscious fear of letting down my readers, but it wouldn't be specifically related to the Wheel of Time in those books.
