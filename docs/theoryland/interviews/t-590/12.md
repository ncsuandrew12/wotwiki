I have an older question that I've been meaning to ask for a while. When the books say that the Blue Ajah throw themselves into Causes, does this mean the Ajah as a whole picks a Cause, or the individual members pick their own causes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

Individual members pick their own causes.
