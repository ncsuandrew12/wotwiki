What's the general time line on Stormlight Archive releases? Do you plan any major gaps in the series, or will books 2-10 likely be your main projects for the next few years?

I wrote a
[blog post](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/925/)
on this back in October.

After I finish
*A Memory of Light*
, my major novel publishing schedule will be Stormlight Archive books two years in a row, followed by something else the next year. This pattern should continue until the series is finished. That doesn't count shorter exploratory side projects like
*Alcatraz*
or
*The Rithmatist*
(formerly called
*Scribbler*
), which comes out in 2012. I'll do one or two of those every year when I take a break after finishing a major novel, and not all of them will get polished to publication standards. Those deviations are largely to keep me from burning out.
