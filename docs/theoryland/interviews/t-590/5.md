The second time Perrin needed to be there for Rand, did that occur on Dragonmount in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

RAFO.

#### Footnote

Brandon
[confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#11)
that this scene from
*Towers of Midnight*
was
not
the fulfillment of Min's viewing concerning Perrin and Rand (from
*Lord of Chaos*
[Chapter 46](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/prophecies/viewings.html)
).
