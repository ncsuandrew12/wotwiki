And how much time has passed since Mat met Verin and the trio left for the Tower of Ghenjei? 30 days?

Mat set aside the letter and didn't open it for the required number of days. The next day he left for the Tower of Ghenjei.

#### Question

And how many days before Rand's epiphany on Dragonmount did Mat and Verin met?

#### Brandon Sanderson
