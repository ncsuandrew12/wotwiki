Is the fact that
*The Way of Kings*
and rest of the books in the series are going to focus each one on a different character connected in any way to the fact that both
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
focused each one on a pair of characters?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

No, not really. Most of my plans for the Stormlight Archive go back years and years to before I was working on the Wheel of Time. I would say that the
*The Gathering Storm*
/
*Towers of Midnight*
character split happened because of the book split, less than any real planning on my part. I had the character arcs and decided which ones would fit well together if I was only going to be releasing one batch of them at a time.

So the answer is no, but with the caveat that with the way my mind works, it may have been working in the same way in both cases.
