In
*Warbreaker*
, is Clod the Lifeless body of Arsteel? I like this idea because Arsteel would have had some Breaths within him when he died, as this is how Vashir defeated him and Denth, and this could help explain why he seems to be a little more self-aware than most Lifeless. Could you respond to this idea?

I confirmed in the
[*Warbreaker*
annotations](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/400/Warbreaker-Chapter-Twenty-Two-Part-2)
that Clod is Arsteel.

Clod is more self-aware than most Lifeless. There is something left of Arsteel within Clod. The Breaths that Vasher gave him when he killed him do have an effect on this.
