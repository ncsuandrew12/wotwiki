Can Returned have children? If so, who was the first Returned to do so?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

I'm going to have to RAFO that one because it's a big RAFO question for the world. In-world, it is believed both that they cannot and that they can. Mythology speaks of it happening, yet many Returned by their own experiment have not been able to have children.
