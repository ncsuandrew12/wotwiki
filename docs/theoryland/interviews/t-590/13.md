Are you aware of and are there any plans in the future to adapt WoT to film or television? Would you be involved in this process at all? And is this something you would be open to doing with your own work sometime in the future?

Red Eagle Entertainment currently has the rights to produce a Wheel of Time film, and I have met with them from time to time. But I'm not directly involved in the process; I'll leave movie making up to the experts.
I talked a little about Wheel of Time movies
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/683)
.
I sold an
*Alcatraz*
movie option to DreamWorks Animation; they've finally passed on it, but a producer is shopping it around to other studios. I also sold a
*Mistborn*
movie option to Paloppa Pictures.
