# [Interview #590: Tor Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#20)

I saw an interview of you talking about
*Way of Kings*
before it came out/before I read it. In the interview you mentioned the ten knights and each book will focus/ be about one of the knights. After reading book one I can honestly say, I have no idea which Knight was supposed to be in book one. Is this by design? Or did I miss the point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not sure what the question means. Do you mean the Heralds? Or the ten orders of the Knights Radiant? The symbol stamped into the front of the first hardcover represents the Windrunners because of Kaladin's awakening as a Windrunner. Also because of Szeth, but mostly because of Kaladin.
