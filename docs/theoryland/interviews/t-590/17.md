Was the symbol of the Ghostbloods the same symbol that you used to move between different scenes in
*The Way of Kings*
' chapters (the three diamonds in a triangle pattern)?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

The Ghostbloods' symbol has interconnected diamonds. I didn't ask Tor for a specific scene break character; that was a design decision on their part.
