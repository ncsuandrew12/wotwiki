# [Interview #590: Tor Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#19)

#### [Dr. T ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/12/open-call-for-brandon-sanderson-questions#149041)

In plotting an epic like
*The Way of Kings*
, to what extent do you outline the whole story? How does that compare with the outline and notes provided by Robert Jordan for the remaining volumes of WoT?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

Robert Jordan and I plot differently. In the notes he tends to talk about scenes that he's working on at the time, whereas I tend to plot out everything, kind of in reverse order. His outlines do end up looking like my outlines in some ways, in that he talks about important moments and I tend to plot backwards, starting from those important moments and moving backward from them. He seemed to be much more of a "I work on this scene because I'm passionate about it" writer, where I am a "I build a framework for the entire book and then start writing" writer.
