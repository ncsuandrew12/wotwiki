# [Interview #590: Tor Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#1)

#### Stubby The Rocket

You
[asked](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/12/open-call-for-brandon-sanderson-questions)
and now Brandon Sanderson answers. Below the cut, you'll find answers to the many, many questions you posted here on Tor.com back in December, touching subjects ranging from the Wheel of Time to The Stormlight Archive to
*Dragonsteel*
and more.

A few hundred questions ended up being sent, so a big thank you goes out to Brandon for taking time out of his busy schedule to sit down and answer as many as possible. (If you don't see your question, most likely it's still in the queue.) An equally big thanks goes out to Peter Ahlstrom for his organizational help!
