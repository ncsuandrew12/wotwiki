Here's a quote. "Why, the Astalsi were rather advanced—they mixed religion with science quite profoundly. They thought that different colors were indications of different kinds of fortune, and they were quite detailed in their descriptions of light and color. Why, it's from them that we get some of our best ideas as to what things might have looked like before the Ascension. They had a scale of colors, and use it to describe the sky of the deepest blue and various plants in their shades of green." Do the pre-Ascension religions correspond to religions from other Shardworlds, as this one seems somewhat like Nalthis?

I mention this in one of the
[*Well of Ascension*
annotations](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/243/Mistborn-2-Chapter-Fifty)
.

After I came up with the idea and had Sazed mention it, my desire to explore it more was one of the initial motivations for
*Warbreaker*
's setting.

The answer to your question is yes and no. There are shadows.
