Who is the First Selector of the Blue Ajah? (and if that gets RAFO'd) Have we seen her on screen or her name mentioned?

The glossary in the back of
*Towers of Midnight*
says, "The First Selector is currently unknown, although it is suspected that Lelaine Akashi fills this position." That suspicion is correct.
