# [Interview #590: Tor Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #48](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#48)

You've mentioned before that all your books so far are in chronological order (
*Elantris*
, the
*Mistborn*
trilogy,
*Warbreaker*
, Stormlight Archive).
*Alloy of Law*
takes place about 200 years after
*The Hero of Ages*
. (Right?) Does this put it chronologically before or after
*Warbreaker*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

The
*Alloy of Law*
takes place around 300 years after
*The Hero of Ages*
and several hundred years before the events in
*The Way of Kings*
. That does put it around the same time as
*Warbreaker*
.

#### Footnote

This was recently changed when Brandon realized a timeline conflict. Way of Kings is now in between Hero of Ages and Alloy of Law.
