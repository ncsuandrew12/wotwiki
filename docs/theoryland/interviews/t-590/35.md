# [Interview #590: Tor Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=590#35)

We are all fans of all of Brandon's stuff in our house, but we are particularly taken with
*Alcatraz*
. And I'm very alarmed by the publisher description that
*Shattered Lens*
is the "fourth and final book." Because the story isn't over yet! End of comas? Altar of encyclopedias? Attica?? Please, PLEASE reassure us that there is indeed another book coming out. Because otherwise we might have to picket Scholastic's offices or something!

I'd be happy if you would picket—though I say that mostly jokingly. I didn't want them to put that on the book. It's not the last book. But those who know what's happened behind the scenes know that Scholastic and I have not seen eye to eye on how the
*Alcatraz*
books have been packaged and distributed.
