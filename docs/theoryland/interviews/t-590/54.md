On your
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
podcast you mentioned a love of maps, especially maps that thematically work with the world of the book (such as the maps in your
*The Way of Kings*
). Given that, what is your all-time favorite fantasy novel map?

Wow, that's putting me on the spot. There are many different aspects I like about a lot of different maps. I love how the map in
*The Hobbit*
is the map the characters carry around. That struck me when I read that book. I really liked how David Eddings' books had a big map and then a zoom-in for every section when the characters would go there. But I wouldn't call either of those my favorite fantasy map.

The main Wheel of Time map is certainly one of the prettiest. But the best I've probably seen is the one from
*Leviathan*
. That one kind of blew me away.
