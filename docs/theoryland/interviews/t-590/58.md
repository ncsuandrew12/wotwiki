What's the next non-sequel book you're wanting to write or rewrite?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

I really would like to get
*Steelheart*
done. That would probably be the next one I'd want to do; that or
*Dark One*
. But I don't know when I will have time for them.
