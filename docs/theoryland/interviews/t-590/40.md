Does the sand storytelling Hoid uses in
*Warbreaker*
have anything to do with your future possible trilogy "Whitesand" written about in a recent blog?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/01/your-questions-for-brandon-sanderson-answered)

No, it does not. This is a storytelling method that Hoid developed on his own. It does have a relationship to
*The Liar of Partinel*
.
