#### Bill Thompson

Does the story progress in a straight linear fashion? Or is there some falling back and kind of circling around?

#### Robert Jordan

Several of these books overlap to one extent or another, so it's not entirely linear. You may go to a book and find out that what's happening at the beginning of that book was actually in the middle, the time frame is actually in the middle of the preceding book. Each of the story lines proceeds in a linear fashion, but they are not always addressed in a way that makes the books linear.
