# [Interview #178: Eye on Books Interview, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=178#4)

#### Bill Thompson

Now is it fair to say that in this volume there is more thinking, less action?

#### Robert Jordan

A little bit. Somewhat less action, yes. I'm not certain that you could say there is less action, let's say there is less "slam-bang" action. A lot of things happen, but none of it is very grandiose and noisy.

#### Bill Thompson

The reason I bring this up, I don't know if you read your reader reviews on Amazon?

#### Robert Jordan

I do not.

#### Bill Thompson

Many of your very most loyal readers seem disappointed with this book because there is a lot of things happening in the mind, or in characters' heads, and not so much on the battlefields any more.

#### Robert Jordan

Well there have been battlefields, and there will be battlefields. But I do not to set out to write a story that is a series of battles. There are many things that have to happen, and some of the things that have to happen are quieter, if no less deadly.

#### Bill Thompson

This comes back to what we were saying a moment ago: that there is an arc of a story to all of your books, and that each individual book may be very different in content from the books that came before it and the books that came after it.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Bill Thompson

This is what you've got clearly in your mind, at least. I will say this: you've got many five-star reviews on Amazon. Some of your readers get that.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, good. I'm glad they do.

#### Bill Thompson

And others do not.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Look, I write this for me. I've had people ask me time and again to "do this", or "do that", or "not do this". And I tell them: I'm sorry. I'm glad that you like to read these books. I'm glad that you have come this far on the journey with me. But I'm writing these books for me. And I know what's going to happen. And what's going to happen is what I want to happen, not what you guys want to happen, necessarily.

#### Bill Thompson

At the pace you think is best.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.
