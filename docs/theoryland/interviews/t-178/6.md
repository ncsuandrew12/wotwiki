#### Bill Thompson

These characters must seem like family to you by now.

#### Robert Jordan

Mmm, I suppose so.

#### Bill Thompson

Or at least visiting family that some day you'll have to say goodbye to and clean up the guest room after them, that kind of thing.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I don't think it will be too traumatic. I've been thinking about what I would write once the Wheel of Time was finished for some time now. About seven or eight years I've been mulling it around in the back of my head. So when I do reach that final scene and send off the manuscript of the last book, I will take two or three months of vacation. That is, I'll take two or three months of vacation if I can actually make myself stay away from my desk for that long. And maybe go somewhere with my wife. And then I will sit down and start writing the next set of books, and I hope that I will be so interested in them that I won't miss the Wheel of Time at all.
