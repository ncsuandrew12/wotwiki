Hi everyone,

Jason here. RJ asked that I post the following pictures of his cousin Wilson. (See his other blog post to see what he was talking about) Here's the note he sent along with the photos:

#### Robert Jordan

Here are a couple of pictures of my Cousin Wilson which I would appreciate you posting. He is as close to me as a brother, and in fact has always been called the fourth of the three Rigney brothers. He is also the first to come through with the promise to shave his head when my hair fell out. In fact, he didn't wait. When I had my hair clippered, he had his shaved.

## [Entry #3](./t-269/3)

#### Jason Denzel

Is it just me or do the Rigney men have heads that are great for shaving?

By the wayâ€”Sorry that it took me a few days to do this. I was out of town until today.

Enjoy.
