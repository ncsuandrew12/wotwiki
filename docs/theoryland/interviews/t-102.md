## [Entry #1](./t-102/1)

#### John Nowacki

Regarding today's signing at Olsson's in DC:

Fairly small crowd, as expected. Very few questions asked (that I overheard), though RJ did repeat the "I've known the last scene since..." bit at least four or five times.

He also told one fellow who wanted a photograph that he didn't mind having his picture taken, but he insisted on keeping his clothes on. Someone in the line said "Damn!" rather loudly, and RJ looked back and said that he hears that a lot. Well...

## [Entry #2](./t-102/2)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that a channeler can hide strength as well as ability to channel, but added that 1) few people know how to do it, and 2) the Aes Sedai don't even know these tricks are possible.

#### John Nowacki

Those caveats are rather obvious, I know. But I mention this answer because I thought I heard it reported here that this question was met with "RAFO" in the past. I'm sure someone will clarify that for me.

## [Entry #3](./t-102/3)

#### John Nowacki

One of the regular contributors to the group—I don't recall whom—suggested asking whether Moridin came into existence before or after the 'gars.

#### Robert Jordan

That one earned a quick glance and a RAFO.

## [Entry #4](./t-102/4)

#### John Nowacki

Well, that's about it, in a nutshell.
