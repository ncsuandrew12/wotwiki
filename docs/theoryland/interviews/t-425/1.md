# [Interview #425, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Garden Ninja Contest](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=425#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The folks over at
[Garden Ninja studio](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/799/www.gardenninja.com)
wrote to let me know that a BSCreview.com is doing a contest where they're giving away some minis. This week,
[it's a contest for a set of Goblin Quest minis](http://www.bscreview.com/2009/06/contest-garden-ninja-studios-miniatures-part-1-patina-finished-goblin-quest-miniatures/)
(from the book series.) They'll have Mistborn minis for give away next week, but I thought you might want to head over this week to get in on the Goblin Quest ones as well.

Also, a kindly reader sent me
[some fanart of Vin](http://robbiek1000.com/Vin_Images.html)
. Thought you guys might like to see it.
