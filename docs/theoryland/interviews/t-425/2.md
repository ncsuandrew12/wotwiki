If you're following along at home,
*The Gathering Storm*
is now in the proofread stage. I got an email letting me know that the manuscript will be coming back after the proofreads in July, and we'll need to have it back by the end of July. Then it's on to production officially. Things are getting close now.

I just need to remember to get new photos taken for the jacket. The ones on my books are now six or seven years old . . .
