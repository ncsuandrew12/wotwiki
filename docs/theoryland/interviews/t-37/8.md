# [Interview #37: LOC Signing Report - Edward Liu, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=37#8)

#### Edward Liu

Oh yes, this is interesting. I asked him if what he has read on the net has ever affected what he writes.

#### Robert Jordan

He said if many people correctly theorize what will happen latter on, he tries to put less clues of what will happen in the future. Also he said that if he finds out that too many people have a totally wrong idea of something, he occasionally tries to put in a clue hinting to what is actually right.
