# [Interview #37: LOC Signing Report - Edward Liu, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=37#4)

#### Edward Liu

I told him about the theory, which someone posted, that Taim is Demandred who will eventually be discovered and killed with Logain replacing him.

#### Robert Jordan

He sounded interested at first, but then he laughed (I think about the part of Logain replacing him as the teacher of the Asha'man). And of course he said, "Read and find out."
