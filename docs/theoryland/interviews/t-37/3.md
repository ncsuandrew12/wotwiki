# [Interview #37: LOC Signing Report - Edward Liu, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=37#3)

#### Edward Liu

Now, regarding Thom, those who argued that Thom
*could*
channel are correct.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said a man will not go mad or sick away if he never channeled. Thus, he agreed that a male channeler who could be taught to channel (as opposed to having the inborn ability) and has never channeled would not die from the taint. BUT, when I asked him if he ever intended to make people think that Thom could channel, he said no. I brought up the hereditary point (i.e., Owyn) but he said just because your parents have a particular gene doesn't mean you'll receive that particular gene. Also he made a point that Owyn was his nephew so therefore not necessarily very similar gene-wise. When I pressed him again on it, he said (I'm quoting) "There is no way in hell Thom can channel." All he offered for explanations is that Thom is a "mysterious man." Enough said.

#### Footnote

Emphasis added for clarity. Edward's assertion is apparently in reference to arguments that, since Thom is so old, he couldn't possibly have the ability to learn.
