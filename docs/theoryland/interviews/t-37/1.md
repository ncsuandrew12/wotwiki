# [Interview #37: LOC Signing Report - Edward Liu, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=37#1)

#### Edward Liu

I just got back from the signing less than an hour ago (so my memory is pretty fresh) and I was able to find out a few interesting things. I was able to ask him 10-15 questionsâ€”anyone top that? It seems most people didn't have questions for RJ and so I was able to stay near RJ after I got my
*Lord of Chaos*
signed and listen to what he said and occasionally ask him something. I was able to do this for about an hour and a half and I even got to help him stack up books that he signed! Alright, I'll get to the point now.
