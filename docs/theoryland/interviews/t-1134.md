## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1134#1)

#### Cognizantastic

As I understand it, Nightblood is most comparable to a Shardblade. However, unlike a Shardblade, Nightblood requires constant input of Investiture in order to realize his full destructive potential. Why is this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher kind of hacked in order to imitate another magic system. Shardblades are organic parts of the world they are on, but Nightblood is a bunch of souls stuffed into something. Nightblood is like a Frankenstein.

#### Footnote

Commentary : I think this provides insight into why objects that are more inhuman necessitate an increased amount of Breaths to Awaken. If the natural state of a Breath is to be attached to a human being, then perhaps all Awakening is creating a 'Frankenstein". Also, "imitate" denotes Vasher being cosmere-aware when Nightblood was created. Perhaps he worldhopped before the events of Warbreaker.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1134#2)

#### Cognizantastic

Was Adonalsium Shattered by an external force?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Adonalsium was not Shattered by himself, herself, or itself. (impish smile)

#### Footnote

Commentary : I am assuming that Brandon was referring to the consciousness (I think the existence of Shards that embody human aspects verifies the existence of a consciousness, although this has not been canonized.), rather than the power of Adonalsium. As I understand it, this leaves 2 possibilities :
1. Adonalsium was Shattered by an external force, in the most obvious sense,
2. Adonalsium was Shattered by an external force, by having his/her/its power manipulated and used against spacehim/her/it, causing the Shattering.

#### Cognizantastic

Is Calamity a Shard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anything that exists or takes place on any version of Earth is not cosmere.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1134#4)

#### Cognizantastic

Did any countries not pass an equivalent of the Capitulation Act?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some did, some didn't. For example, Canada didn'tâ€¦ and things didn't go very well for them.

#### Question

Were the areas where they didn't livable?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, livable is a broad definition. For some people, Newcago is livable.
