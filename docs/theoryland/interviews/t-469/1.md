# [Interview #469: TGS Signing Report - Yellowbeard, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=469#1)

#### Yellowbeard

I went to one of the two Atlanta area signings yesterday. It was the evening one.

Got there an hour and a half late. Had to get home from work, take care of man/daddy duties (have a stressed out woman and three kids at home), do dinner, etc.

Got there just as they were starting to sign books. Waited for about an hour to get mine signed.

BS wrote "Peace favor your sword" and signed over his name.

Harriet wrote "Best, Harriet McDougal".

Unfortunately I missed the reading/talking/Q&A session.
