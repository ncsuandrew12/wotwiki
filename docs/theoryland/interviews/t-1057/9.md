# [Interview #1057, Entry #9]: Brandon Sanderson: "We haven't hit what epic fantasy is capable of yet"](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1057#9)

#### Jason Krell

You often talked about the influence that Robert Jordan had on you as a writer, so how do you feel about now being the same influence that RJ was to new young writers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is just amazing to me. I became a writer in the first place because reading the fantasy books that I love had such a profound effect on me emotionally that I said, "I have to learn how to do this. I have to." Now being able to talk to people and realize its working and inspiring another generation—and you know, people react against or toward me in the same way I'd react against or toward the things that came before —that's cool. You're part of something—part of something big. Part of this genre I love. It makes me really excited.
