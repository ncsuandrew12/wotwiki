# [Interview #1057: Brandon Sanderson: "We haven't hit what epic fantasy is capable of yet", Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1057#6)

How is
*Firefight*
coming along?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I just turned in the third draft to my editor and it turned out great. There are two things I'll need to fix in the next draft that I know of right now. And you always have things like that, but I wanted to get my editors perspective on it. Then we'll see what she says and I'll try to figure out what to do next. But it's looking really good.
