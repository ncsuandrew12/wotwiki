Brandon Sanderson's new book
*Words of Radiance*
debuted at #1 on the
*New York Times*
Besteller List. What does he think is the secret of his popularity, and the reason for epic fantasy's resurgence? We asked him, and he explained why epic fantasy is ready to take it to the next level.

We caught up with Sanderson at the University of Arizona, where he was appearing at the annual Tucson Festival of Books. He took a few minutes out of his busy schedule to talk about why he comes to events like this, the fantasy genre, writing practices, and his future projects.
