# [Interview #1057, Entry #4]: Brandon Sanderson: "We haven't hit what epic fantasy is capable of yet"](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1057#4)

#### Jason Krell

You had that
[essay on Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/03/words-of-radiance-and-the-art-of-creating-epic-fantasy)
where you talked about
*The Way of Kings*
, and I'm guessing
*Words of Radiance*
too, being your most honest work. Do you think it's important for other writers not to worry so much about the business side, and write what they want to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can only speak from my own experience, which may be abnormal, but I really feel that the times where I worried too much about the market were the times I wrote my worst fiction. And the times where I wrote: "this is what I want to readâ€”this is what I'm passionate about," I wrote my best fiction. And so that's what I would advise.

That being said, I was very steeped in this genre. You can say what I wanted to read was very naturally an outgrowth of what a lot of what the fandom wanted to read because I was one of them. That's why it worked for me. And I'm sure there are a number of people who are writing to their passion, and it just doesn't end up catching on. I wrote 13 books before I got published, and at the end of the day I decided I would rather keep writing and never publish than give up writing or go do something else. And if I reached the end of my life and had 70 unpublished novels, I'd still consider myself a successful writer. That decision has driven me ever since and it's worked out for me.
