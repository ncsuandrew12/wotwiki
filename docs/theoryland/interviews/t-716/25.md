I've been getting questions about "Unfettered," an anthology next year with a Wheel of Time story in it. Blog post next week, but...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/254390937554403330)

The "story" is actually a deleted sequence from
*A Memory of Light*
we cut for pacing reasons. We donated it to Shawn to help pay his medical bills.

As I said, I will blog this soon. It is from the viewpoint of someone you know, but not one of the main characters.

#### [Jonathan B.](https://twitter.com/ka243/status/255266370638446592)

Could you let us know where the "story" would have gone in the book once its released so we can read it in order?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/255409491535859712)

Sure.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/256098486850838528)

A deleted sequence from
*A Memory of Light*
called "River of Souls" will appear in the anthology
*Unfettered*
(early 2013).
