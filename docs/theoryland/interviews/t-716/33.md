Memory 24 is such a boring teaser and on @BrandSanderson's birthday too. This is not right! @tordotcom should give us a bonus memory.

Ha. Okay, Teaser: "River of Souls" was a direct result of me trying to do be better at something RJ did well & I did poorly.

Problem is, I overdid it, and the story veered far too "Brandon-ish" as a result, which was why we cut it.

Fortunately, by having done "River of Souls", the added depth behind-the-scenes helped fix the very issue I was worried about.
