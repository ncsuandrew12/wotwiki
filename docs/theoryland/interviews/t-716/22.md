# [Interview #716: Twitter 2012 (WoT), Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=716#22)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 September 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246284437988442112)

The prologue ebook for
*A Memory of Light*
, "By Grace and Banners Fallen," is up for preorder on Dragonmount. Other vendors to follow.

#### [Austin Moore](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/246321131198488576)

After prologue is released on October 2nd, will you be able to say which part of it was all RJ?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246333806204837889)

Yes.

#### [Sam Tills](https://twitter.com/SamTills/status/246289192877953024)

Will this be part of the whole book when it comes out, or will it only be sold separately?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246334079115595776)

Tor and Harriet like to sell the prologue early as a separate ebook. It will be the same one in the final book.

#### [Brian LeP](https://twitter.com/BLePinTO/status/246285124705067008)

I know that this isn't your idea, but selling the prologue is a brutal cash grab. I'll save my $3 and wait for the book.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246334357013417984)

I have made it clear both to fans and Tor that I do not like this process. But you are right, I do not get to choose.

#### [Jasmin](https://twitter.com/buitenj/status/246362422066171904)

No normal book??? Only an ebook??

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/246365298184314880)

Tor releases the prologue of each WoT early as a for-sale ebook. It is the same one that will be in the print edition in January.

#### Footnote

On September 17, the prologue showed up for sale on Google Books in Canada, including some revealing previews that tempted fans (aside from the Canadians who were able to buy it) to piece together the prologue from Google Book searches. Predictably, chaos ensued.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom (17 September)](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/247802172652285952)

I blame Canada.

#### [sleepinghour](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/247808787925303296)

Last time it was some guy in China with an early
*Towers of Midnight*
copy. But Canada was the dark horse nobody saw coming. #amolgate

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/247804948983738368)

I hope moving up release date is a possibility, elsewise a little black market will emerge very soon...

#### Footnote

I should disclose that I was essentially the ringleader of the put-the-prologue-together team, but I wasn't trying to make a threat here. It wasn't even my idea, and if I hadn't organized it, someone else would have; that's just how things go in the WoT world. But I was really referring to the possibility that some of the Canadians would share the whole prologue, or even sell it.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/247884605728894978)

I'm going to pretend like Brandon did this on purpose. #wotgh

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/247813492567064576)

Now I just blame Google. What a cluster\*\*\*\*.

#### [sleepinghour (September 18)](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/248005558622380032)

What's sad about the prologue leak is that Harriet and others in publishing will likely see this as proof ebook releases should be delayed.

#### [Mike Beckwith](https://twitter.com/RogueInsight/status/248174751212765184)

Wow. I know I'd be pretty pissed. Wonder how Sanderson feels about it. @BrandSanderson Spoiler thoughts?

#### [sleepinghour](https://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/248161089865535488)

Google's stopped the sale now, but some people already have copies and shared spoilers. So Harriet & Co. probably aren't happy.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248199965321601024)

I'm not fond of spoilers, but I can't see the original comment, so I don't know the specifics of this discussion.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248253641339846656)

This sort of thing happens. I don't really mind, personally. Harriet is probably upset, however.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248248663032356864)

If you're the type who wants the $2.99
*A Memory of Light*
prologue ebook, it will be available September 19th instead of October 2nd.

#### [Brandon Stetter](https://twitter.com/BrandonStetter/status/248261702381080577)

Is that correct? The ebook will be available tomorrow instead of October 2nd? Pre-order or not?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248263233075544064)

I believe so.

#### [Austin Moore (September 19)](https://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/248274281270747136)

Was the RJ part of the prologue the Bayrd scene?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248279531671150594)

No, actually. It was the Isam part, though I filled in a hole in the middle of the scene.

#### [Tor Nordam](https://twitter.com/tornordam/status/248280320653291520)

Looking forward to it. But do you know when it'll be available in Europe?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248282111558160385)

I don't know, I'm afraid. That is up to the UK publisher, and I don't think ebooks are as big a concern to them as they are here.

#### [Étienne Bausson](https://twitter.com/ebausson/status/248306970141028352)

Where can European people get it from? Dragonmount won't sell it to me. Do I have to go for a torrent?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248310459323789313)

The problem is that Tor doesn't have rights to sell it in Europe. It's a frustrating system, but Orion UK has the European rights.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248310967153328128)

The system made more sense back before ebooks; a European company needed assurance US publishers wouldn't flood their markets.

#### [Étienne Bausson](https://twitter.com/ebausson/status/248313974314106880)

I will check Orion UK once at work. Thanks for the tip!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248315079404163072)

Warning: they might have been planning to release it in October. This whole "Release it two weeks early" thing surprised us.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248315441657827328)

It's because of leaked copies in Canada. (Also, it's Orbit in UK—not Orion. I get them mixed up.)

#### [Aulis Vaara (20 September)](https://twitter.com/AulisVaara/status/248781225664323585)

What is your opinion on the North American exclusivity of the
*A Memory Of Light*
prologue?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248872507455721472)

It's because Tor doesn't have rights to sell anywhere else; Orbit UK has those rights. If you want the book, ask them.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248872714419449856)

I wish Orbit had it out too, and I'm seeing what I can do. But it is their call.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248906447168106499)

Tor has a
[post](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/qby-grace-and-banners-fallenq-now-available-in-select-non-us-markets)
indicating that the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue ebook is now for sale in select countries outside the U.S.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248906663317352448)

Note that this doesn't include countries where Orbit UK has rights to the books. To buy it there, you'll need to ask them to release it.

#### [Danny Hooper](https://twitter.com/themanofdann/status/248907129367437313)

Who do we contact to ask them to release it? Is there an email address we can write to?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/248908561713860608)

They have a
[form](http://www.orbitbooks.net/contact-us/)
on their website. That might work.

#### [Michael](https://twitter.com/micky_magpie/status/248926267137736704)

Where can Australian fans get a copy of the WOT release?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249002562487992320)

Orbit UK owns the rights. They'd have to either release it or authorize Dragonmount. You can email them through their website.

#### [Lane Thompson](https://twitter.com/lanestp/status/248921587447894016)

Is the prologue going to come out in audio or do I need to pick it up the written down on magic pixel paper version?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249002666318000128)

No audio I'm aware of. (Until the full book is out, of course.)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249002801152262145)

Oh, just saw that there was one. Never mind.

#### [Marc Taylor](https://twitter.com/shellimark/status/249249578283581440)

Any idea as to when will Weller @WellerBookWorks starts taking autograph orders for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249249713969299456)

Not sure.

#### [Daniel Shepard (21 September)](https://twitter.com/The81stShepard/status/249295449331212290)

By grace and banners fallen. Was that your line or RJ's? Exquisitely eloquent if I say so myself.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/249301568657178624)

How bad is this? I honestly can't remember. It's one of my favorite lines, but I don't know if it was in the notes or not.

#### [Jonny Nilsson](https://twitter.com/dreamedge84/status/250366561972539392)

Will it be possible to order
*A Memory of Light*
signed, like the previous two books?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/250368416769273856)

Yes, it should be.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (24 September)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/250333947958026240)

Jason of Dragonmount writes the world's first
[review](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/dear-robert-jordan)
of
*A Memory of Light*
in the form of a touching letter to Robert Jordan.
