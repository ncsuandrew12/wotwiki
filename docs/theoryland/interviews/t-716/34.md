# [Interview #716: Twitter 2012 (WoT), Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=716#34)

#### Terez

This conversation is actually from 2013, but after soliciting opinions on whether or not I should include it in the database at all, I decided to stick it at the very bottom of the 2012 page so that it's less likely anyone will be 'subjected to it' (as one fan put it) by surprise. There are not really any distinctive search terms in the conversation, and I haven't tagged it. I think it's worth documenting just because Brandon was pushed to say some things here that he might not have otherwise said, but be warned, many fans found it 'painful' to read.

#### [Luckers (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290108553576984577)

Was feeling damn Zen about
*A Memory of Light*
... then I read @BrandSanderson interviews. Seriously, what idiot wrapped him in swaddling? @PeterAhlstrom

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290116191274561537)

So, @BrandSanderson gave up on trying to read Jordan's notes after two months, instead relying on Maria and Alan. Sadly, this shows.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290117165410025474)

Comparatively he has been working on the Wheel for 60 months. Maybe a larger stint than 1.2% of his time might have been effective.

#### [Shawn Prosper](https://twitter.com/Daewolf/status/290115170750058496)

Gotta ask what you mean? I'm confused what you are referring to.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290119934841864192)

It's just the vast divergence between Brandon's perception of his work and the actual.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290121266969591808)

To be frank I am entirely cognizant of the difficulties @BrandSanderson faced. Working in a world not his own, with Harriet the final word.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290121523912650754)

That being said, so long as @BrandSanderson presumes to think he aced it, we have problems, and Mat is nothing but the tip of the iceberg.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290122160821903360)

Which brings us back to this—who wrapped @BrandSanderson in swaddling, and played with his toes? Who led him to believe he did well?

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290127138227634176)

Aced it is overstating. He knows many things didn't turn out perfectly. Nevertheless the conversations people are having...

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290127413738872832)

...about the book right now are the right conversations and that says a lot.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290108553576984577)

He still knows large portions of the book won't work for some readers. Zen is a better reaction than expected.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290108553576984577)

Yet I've never seen him express this. It's always you, if that. His comments are all about how content he is with his work.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290134288438005760)

And, for that matter, what are the 'right' conversations?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290135141936922624)

It's not that he disagrees, its that he appears oblivious, hence my question about who is wrapping him in swaddling.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290135774047924224)

IMO Brandon likes to put the best face on things—he knows the caveats are there but doesn't need to accompany every statement...

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290136089321164800)

...with the caveats. It also depends on the attitude of the person he's talking with. If he were talking to you he'd be more...

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290136223777968129)

...likely to talk about the other issues. This is all in my opinion.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290136921299095554)

...so how bout he talk to me? Directly? About this specifically.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290137125083553792)

JordanCon! :D

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138037441155073)

Damn you. Honest to Verin, I want nothing more right now than to join you in the grin.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138432464908288)

But the fact is the book is out, and I'll not be placated.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138642519834625)

Brandon is asserting how he hasn't broken the fourth wall despite that being the largest complaint against him.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138800833822720)

He thinks he's perfected Mat, despite the fact that at best the Betas carved the winks to the reader from the book.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290153748322451461)

To me breaking the fourth wall means the characters talk directly to the reader or talk about how they're fictional characters.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290153867642036225)

And in my view that never happens in the books.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290154090447634432)

Things that "take you out of the book" are a valid criticism but that's different from breaking the fourth wall.

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/290154874191101952)

Semantics really. I think the proper term is fanservice. ;)

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/290155626594725888)

I can accept that term. :D

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290138937568149504)

Fact is, we're at the end of things, and Brandon has to answer for himself. And the more he talks, the more that is so.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290140000446738433)

And @PeterAhlstrom the most significant point about all this is that he seems oblivious of the criticism.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290141794396688384)

Give a look at the others @ing me sometime. Not everyone feels as you do. I certainly don't.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290142684612530178)

Dude, I am very aware of those who support you, you've done good work—great work, even.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290142967904215040)

But you hide behind them.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143260666626049)

And you always have. You can always find those who support you, just as you can always find those who disagree.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143455299133441)

It's how you respond that matters, and you have disdained those who disagree and raised up those who agree. Hence our problem.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290149434627596288)

Disdained? Where have I ever disdained you or anyone else? I have always accepted and tried to understand my critics.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290149710872866817)

I've listened. As I've told you, just because I decide I don't agree with your complaints doesn't mean I am ignoring you.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290149803835420672)

You are correct. Disdained is not the right word, but nor have you accepted or tried to understand your critics.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290150526614638593)

And you not agreeing is fine. I've told you that!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290142866787930112)

What's the point of tweeting me now? It is done. The book's out. I know your complaints. I don't agree. That is where we end.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143764931031040)

This is the fundamental element of our disagreement. For you this was just a job.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290143938617159681)

You picked up something precious, because it was shiny, and played with it like it was a toy.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290144119697862656)

Now you think to throw it aside, and expect us to let it go, but here's the thing—battered and broken, it's still precious.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290150358230126592)

When have I EVER called this "Just a job?" I dare you to find where I refer to the WoT, as anything other than precious.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290150604012154880)

I picked up something that love, and I treated it with love. You continue to insist I am lying about this. Why?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151285355864064)

Because, to be frank, all that I have seen of this has been cavalier. And I mean at every point.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151493577887746)

I've seen that you enjoyed the Wheel. I saw when that stopped. I saw you withdraw, and I saw no change to the work product.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151823145332738)

And I was content. But when I see you comment about how you didn't break the fourth wall when that is the single most...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290151953084850176)

...common complaint currently (and to be clear I am completely inactive on the boards at the moment)...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290152128750706688)

...and things like how you mastered Mat...this has nothing to do with me.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290145912091721729)

As for where we end... I've followed the Wheel since I was 12. Where precisely do you think I'll simply stop?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290151143521284096)

The "stop" referred to tweeting me. I expect you to continue to be involved.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290151343698628608)

But what is the point of continuing to tweet me with the same complaints after I have said "I understand but disagree?"

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290151516797546496)

And finally, as for referring to those who enjoyed the book, you ASKED me who said I did well. I answered your question.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290152477976829952)

Fair enough. Though I do still question which particular group led you to the sweeping statements of success you've made.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154154599530497)

You can find people and reviews who say I did a poor job. I can find reviews and people who say I did a great job.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290154330135347201)

Yes, this is true. Neither mean much.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154267543732225)

We will spin round and around on this topic, going nowhere. But at the end of the day...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154620322451456)

I KNOW I did a good job. Not perfect, but very good. I know it as an artist. To me, that's secondary only to Harriet's opinion.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154759363645440)

And she feels it turned out very well. She is the one I agreed to do this for, her and RJ. That's why I can say what I do.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290155668298690560)

Okay, firstly, I've seen you an Peter cast aspersions on Harriet's judgement. So what the fuck are you doing here? Hiding?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290156273356382208)

I mean, serious aspersions. You've cited her to me as the basis of many faults.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290156343816503297)

Now you cite her as proof you've done well. Fuck that, man.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290154919468617729)

If criticisms mean an artist can't be proud of their work, then nobody would be allowed. You say I don't love the WOT.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155086250930178)

You're wrong. You don't know my heart or my passion. And I'm very, very happy with what I have done. As a fan and as an artist.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155276454211585)

This is why I say there is no further point. I accept what you say. Hopefully, I can use it to be better in the future.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155438857654273)

But I am tired of opening Twitter and finding you tweeting me, yet again, to make the same complaints.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290157354937376768)

They aren't coming in a vacuum. You speak on the Wheel and it will draw its reaction. This won't go away.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155608999616514)

Please. Let's shake hands and part. You will continue to criticize, as is your right.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290155759516405760)

But from here, it has no relevance upon changing my approach to the WoT, for it is done. So let us end.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290158817478582273)

Irrespective you have to handle the fall out. You can acknowledge its radioactive or think it rain—doesn't stop it falling.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290159554677850112)

Final note—it's not about changing anything. I was never trying to 'save the Wheel'. It's worse, it's judgement.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290159817824280576)

...and it won't go away. It won't acknowledge that you're done and be done in turn. It will in fact do nothing but grow. Sorry.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290158091415191553)

This is where I make the 'I will wait for you on Toman Head' joke, but I dislike being Shazam!!

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290158333686587393)

Seriously though, you seem aggrieved that I don't simply let you walk. Are you out there talking about the Wheel every day?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290159320597921792)

Yes, James. I just don't want to talk to you about it any longer.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290159600613855232)

Today you have sworn at me, called me a child, implied I lie frequently, and told me I don't love something I do dearly.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290159835293548545)

You moved from criticism to harassment long ago, but I have tried to continue to find common ground.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290160183303348224)

Fair enough.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290160106153328642)

Even here, I want to respond to your allegations about me and Harriet—which are wrong—but you speak in such a harsh way.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290160447200587776)

I want to be done not because I don't like responding to criticism, but because I find interaction with you to be caustic.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290160658899677184)

And if I were to say that being caustic has been the only thing to draw a response from you?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290161078367838208)

...the only thing to draw a half way honest response, and even then not truly a response?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290162288734916610)

And so we end with you calling me a liar again. This is why, James.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290162960226197505)

Not a liar. You live in your own world. And when you speak, our truths clash.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290163231522172929)

Or I suppose you could reverse that. Irrespective, I'm not calling you a liar.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290162966387638272)

You don't get answers or responses because you don't ask questions. You make accusations.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290161886035591168)

I never set out to be caustic, and when I was I didn't say it to draw a response... but you hide.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290163253835882496)

The reason for silence is because it should be the artist's way. Listen to criticism. Do not defend against it.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290163610850844672)

And yet you aren't silent.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290163771786276866)

Let the work stand on its own. Nothing is accomplished by being defensive. I am very proud of what I have done. Goodbye.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/290165611202498560)

And as all things fall, my one regret is that you do not know how highly I regard you. Sweetness is bitter, and that is all that may be done.
