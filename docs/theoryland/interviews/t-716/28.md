# [Interview #716: Twitter 2012 (WoT), Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=716#28)

Dragonmount is now a complete @BrandSanderson bashing ground. This is becoming unbearable. What happened? Was not so last year.

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/262265339138682880)

It's unfortunate, but natural. I've grown popular enough that some people say my wot books are better than RJ's, which isn't true.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/262266502772834304)

The hardcore fans then feel the need to point out the flaws in my efforts, and many things they say are true.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/262266868688105473)

I do wish some were not as vicious as they are, however.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155015848448001)

So, apparently @BrandSanderson has chosen to believe that the criticism levelled at him is just a jealous reaction.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155203732291584)

A response by hardcore fans loyal to Jordan to the suggestion that @BrandSanderson's work on the Wheel is better than RJ.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155547199643648)

In @BrandSanderson's defence, he does offer that the hardcore fans use some truth in their jealous rage.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263155809679183872)

So I suppose at least @BrandSanderson offers efficacy to our criticism, if not legitimacy.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263163906162323457)

I'm curious as to where you gain your insights into the criticism? After all you could not even bring yourself to read a...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164321616498688)

...critique wrapped in kiddy gloves that you yourself requested. Are you sure this isn't some sort of self-rationalisation?

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164441980456960)

After all, a small select group blowing minor (but admittedly real) flaws out of proportion in a misguided attempt...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164660386234369)

... at loyalty to Jordan is a much easier thing to swallow than the idea that the criticism might have truth...

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263164834764435456)

... in both the specifics and in the degree of its existence.

#### [Luckers](https://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/263165163610468352)

Anyway, I'm done raging at you now. Wow. That was weird. Must have seen someone suggest you were better than Jordan.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263346802944786433)

Luckers, I worry sometimes about how strongly you react to things like this. I didn't call the criticisms minor or misguided.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263347327589306368)

I agreed they are true. I am flawed. I cannot yet write well as you want me to. I'm sorry you find that personally offensive.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263347771686416384)

I do not think that is the only reason people criticize me. Twitter makes it hard to explain things in depth.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/263348449506889728)

I have seen it being a factor—explicitly, by the poster's own words—in criticism. I find that noble. I didn't want to offend.
