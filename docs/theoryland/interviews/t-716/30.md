in a Q&A that 62.5% of women strong enough to be Aes Sedai, yet only 20% of 1000 novices are strong enough. How so?

That sounds like a question for Maria, I'm afraid. I don't have the notes handy to look into the discrepancy.

Email is probably best, or grabbing her at JordanCon. (Or sending the question with someone you know who is attending.)

Actually, the easiest way is probably to drop me an email through my website and let me forward it on to her.
