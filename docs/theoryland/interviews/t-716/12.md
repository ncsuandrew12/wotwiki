# [Interview #716: Twitter 2012 (WoT), Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=716#12)

All right. Kelsier and Moiraine are facing each other in the Suvudu cage match next round. Guess I should do a write up.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183111066673360896)

I think I'll just flip a coin to decide who wins, then write something that makes it seem logical.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183116423416123392)

Though this is (for a Suvudu Cage Match) actually quite even, I'm going to have to play it very tongue-in-cheek. Just a warning.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183116568891363328)

Don't expect an epic battle. I don't have the time to spare to write up something like that in this case.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183120294356070400)

Okay, that's done. Quick and dirty, I'm afraid, but it's all the time I could spare. Should be up on Suvudu soon, maybe on my website also.

Warning: it not only contains huge spoilers for both series, but a lot of WoT and Mistborn in jokes.

If you disagree with the results of my coin flip, feel free to vote however you wish in the cage match poll. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183277969270255616)

Write up I did for Kelsier and Moiraine will go up Monday, I believe. I'll post a link when it goes live.

#### [AIDAN MOHER](https://twitter.com/adribbleofink/status/183285555017166848)

You stole my cage match, Brandon! ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183303332956340224)

Ha! You were the one who would tackle this, eh?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/183303410626473985)

Well, if you had something cool you wanted to do, I'll post it on my site if you still want to write it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (26 MARCH)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184370473977655297)

In case you haven't seen it, my Moiraine vs Kelsier write up is

I liked it, it was a fun read, still voted for Moiraine though :P ^\_^

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184371447630807040)

I actually tried to leave it ambiguous at the end. The thing people should be asking themselves is this:

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184371564110811136)

"As the write-up was from Kelseir's viewpoint, can we assume that the whole thing happened as Moiraine wanted it to?"

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/184371772047626241)

You need to ask yourself that whenever you end a conversation with an Aes Sedai. :)
