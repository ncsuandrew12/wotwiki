Tor dot com has

the excerpt from
*A Memory of Light*
that I'm reading today.

A little disgusted that you included a throwaway line about Tylin raping Mat. Still buying the book though. Probably twice.

Hard to ignore that it happened, returning to the city as he was.

... you re-awakened the Mat/Tylin sexual assault vs. super funny joke fury. Ahh the indignant fandom. \*sighs\*

\*sighs in agreement\*

#### [W.S.E.](https://twitter.com/SunDriedRainbow/status/242823337263386624)

I feel the same way about all the characters saying "you go Tylin" in
*A Crown of Swords*
, too.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/242827497241206784)

It is one of the WoT's most controversial sequences, to be sure.

The three excerpts of
*A Memory of Light*
that have been released so far:
<http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/04/a-memory-of-light-prologue-excerpt>
<http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/07/read-an-excerpt-from-chapter-one-of-a-memory-of-light>

#### Footnote

RJ apparently
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=65#2)
that it was supposed to be seen as rape, and that it was also supposed to be funny. Some fans took the humorous treatment of the subject very badly (because rape is, after all, quite serious), but RJ was likely trying to draw attention to the double standard.
