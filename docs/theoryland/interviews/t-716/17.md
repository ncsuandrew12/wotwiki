Do you see the speed your books get published at changing with the end of WoT? Seeing as how editing WoT takes so much longer?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 May 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/204698782519144448)

Yes, I do. Getting WoT right takes about double the time it takes to do my own works, so we shouldn't have any more no-book years.
