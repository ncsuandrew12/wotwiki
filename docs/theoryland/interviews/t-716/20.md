@Terez27 Trying to figure out who the gay character was that @BrandSanderson put in
*Towers of Midnight*
. Was it Androl?

#### [Terez](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/223681755641692160)

That is my best guess. I wonder if we scared him away from going through with that...'twas very controversial.

The place wasn't right in
*Towers of Midnight*
. Gay character is in
*A Memory of Light*
. It's really not a big deal; just a small mention.

I will say, at this point, that it is a character RJ mentioned was gay in the notes, so I noted it in the text.

I won't say if it's a new character or one I made a decision on, since there weren't notes either way.

#### [Terez (13 July 2012)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/223691141336403968)

I'm guessing that's a product of Twitter being a bad place for trying to say things clearly. The older tweet was confusing anyway.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223712573911085057)

Wow, that was indeed confusing. I don't even know what I was trying to say.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/223712712297947138)

What I remember typing was "I won't tell you if it's something RJ had in notes or not."
