I know you see my tweets. Show some respect toward Mr. Jordan and release his notes on the completion of the series. #shady

I'm sorry. I often miss tweets. I haven't seen any of your others. I would be happy to release the notes if Harriet allows it.

Thank you. It would bring joy to my heart to feel his words on the ending of the greatest story told. No disrespect intended.

I understand. I plan to push Harriet on this more once the last book is out.
