# [Interview #98: TPOD Signing Report - Michael Martin, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=98#2)

#### Michael Martin

My first question: "Was the Aes Sedai who initiated the Pact of Rhuidean from the Age of Legends?" (From
*The Shadow Rising*
).

#### Robert Jordan

(Pause) "No." (Pause) "No, she was not from the Age of Legends."

#### Michael Martin

My reason for asking had to do with the Oath Rod theory about agelessness and such.
