# [Interview #98, Entry #7]: TPOD Signing Report - Michael Martin](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=98#7)

#### Michael Martin

RJ was very personable and seemed to genuinely enjoy the interaction with the fans. I was disappointed, however, by how few questions there wereâ€”most people simply stood there silently while he signed. I was also surprised by how few people seemed to know about the newsgroup, the FAQ, and the Compleat Index.

There were a number of people there who were only partway through the series (although I guess we
*all*
are only partway through the series!) and many had not yet read the book.
