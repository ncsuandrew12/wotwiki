# [Interview #98: TPOD Signing Report - Michael Martin, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=98#4)

#### Michael Martin

He went on to repeat what he has said beforeâ€”knowing the end, knowing all the major events, yadda yadda. However, what he did said that was new (at least for me) was that the
*order*
of events was
*not*
set, and that he allowed some fluidity for them. He made a remark about a cousin of his (who is an engineer) who came over and saw all the notes and work and asked why RJ hadn't created something called "critical flow charts" or some such. RJ replied that the nature of the story was too complex for such linear breakdown.
