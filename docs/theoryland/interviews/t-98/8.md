Like Matthew Hunter (see
[his post](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97")
), I was surprised by the candor of RJ's remarks regarding Sweet's covers. At least we know he is just as exasperated by them as we are. If only Michael Whelan and Jordan had been able to work a deal outâ€”man. Talk about poster-worthy and collectible art.
