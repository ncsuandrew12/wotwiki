#### Marc Aplin

Okay, the next question we haveï¿½I think this one you might have answered beforeï¿½but have we met all the main point-of-view characters yet? Or, if not, what percentage are we talking?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You have met almost all of them. Let me do a count... Let's see. The main characters in the book areï¿½in the seriesï¿½Kaladin, and Dalinar, Adolin, Jasnah, Shallan, and Navani, whom you all met in this book and most of them had viewpoints. Szeth, Taravangian, and Taln. And one of the other Heralds; I'm not going to tell you who that is. But I think you've met...you have, I'm sure, met that person; I know he's in there. And so, I think you've met them all, basically. Taln is the person who shows up in the epilogue.

#### Marc Aplin

Excellent.
