#### Question

You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVDâ€”what are they?

#### Robert Jordan

The one book would be whatever book I was currently writing. I mean, I hate falling behind in the work. The one CD would contain the best encyclopedia I could find on desert island survival. The DVD would contain as much of Beethoven, Mozart, and Duke Ellington as I could cram onto it.
