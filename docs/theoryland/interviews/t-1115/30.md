#### Question

How do they work with spheres being the money, magic system, and lighting on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They would say, “How could you have three different things to fulfill those functions?” Mostly rich people use spheres for lighting. Poor people use candles and such since you don’t want to leave your spheres out in the open. There are low-light spheres worth the same amount as a candle, so someone could swipe that and there wouldn’t be a difference.
