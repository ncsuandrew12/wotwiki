# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#58)

#### Question

Why can you never find the fourth book in the Alcatraz series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because the fourth book had the lowest distribution and was not printed in paperback. And so.. but the reprints of those -- the new ones that Tor is doing -- I’ve seen the covers and they’re awesome. They’re the first time I’ve gotten good covers on an Alcatraz book. So I’m very excited about those.

#### Question

You did like [name]’s covers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No I thought they were terrible. The first one wasn’t bad. I was ok with the first one. But they got progressively worse I felt.
