# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#69)

#### Question

Whatâ€™s the secret to getting books out as fast as you do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The secret is my work ethic. Pioneer work ethic. Pat is a perfectionist. I get it pretty good and hand it to my editor to polish. His biggest strength over me is his lyrical prose. That extra 1% takes him two years. I love what I do and I write every day.
