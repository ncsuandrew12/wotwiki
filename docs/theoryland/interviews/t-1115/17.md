#### Question

Who would I cast to play Wayne in Alloy of Law?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He doesnâ€™t cast characters; pays attention to directors. Impressed by Matthew McConaughey these last few years. Best actors are versatile. He cast the Legion hallucinations as famous actors except for Kalyani.
