#### Question

What influenced your characters in Steelheart? Comic books? Specific ones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Iâ€™ve read a lot of comics. Watchman influences everyone. Kingdom Come - one of first that really made me think about comics. The original Turtles. Graphic novels (self contained) like the Killing Joke.
