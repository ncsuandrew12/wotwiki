# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #61](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#61)

#### Question

From the very beginning did you already know like the Cosmere? Like was that your goal setting out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was my goal very early on. In fact, before I wrote any books I wrote a short story about Hoid. So he goes back to before the very first book that I wrote. So yeah it goes back pretty far. I can trace inspirations back to Asimov tying Foundation and Robots together and feeling like that was really cool and wanting to do something like that, if it makes sense. And so I would say thatâ€™s probably like the first seed was when I read the later Foundation books and they tied them together.
