# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #63](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#63)

#### Question

I was reading stuff online about like a Mistborn videogame…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, we’ll still working on it. It’s taking much longer than we thought. The developer the producer of the game and I had chosen -- they, ah, had a falling out and split and so we had to start over from scratch and that’s what really threw us for a loop. We then took it to a really prestigious one game company that I love and they considered it for a long time, but it turned out that they just didn’t have the time and couldn’t do it. So now we are kind of back to square one finding a third group to do it.
