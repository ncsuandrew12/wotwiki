# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#39)

#### Question

I’m at a magazine and we were wondering if you could do an interview or a short story.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can do the interview, but I don’t do short short stories, short means 17,000 words for me.
