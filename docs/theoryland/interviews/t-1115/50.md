# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #50](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#50)

#### Question

I have a final question then, is there a Hoid cameo in Shadows for Silence?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I intentionally didn’t put one in, because I didn’t- couldn't come- there was no reason for him to be there, and I didn’t want to be doing it just to do it, if that makes sense, like, the Cosmere isn’t just a bunch of cameos, it is a story within itself.
