# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #70](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#70)

#### Question

If you electrified metal would that have any impact on being able to Steelpush or Ironpull it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not currently have that as an effect. That interfering with it requires Investiture. And electrifying is not Investiture. So no it would not. In fact, Iâ€™m absolutely sure it will not because the plans call for that to be a possibility they are doing in the future.
