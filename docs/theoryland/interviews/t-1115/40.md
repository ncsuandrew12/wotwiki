# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#40)

#### Question

When it comes to like, touring and stuff like that, how do you pick these locations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sometimes, it’s my publisher, sometimes it’s me saying let’s go somewhere different. And sometimes it’s places where I’ve come a lot where they do a good job, like when I come to a store like this, I think they do a good job, so I put a good report into the publisher and say, feel free to send me back to that store.
