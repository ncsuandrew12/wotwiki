# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#64)

#### Question

My question was about Shards actually. So at the end of Words of Radiance Syl is turning into a Shardblade as well as other different weapons. And Kaladin has a whole bunch of Windspren around him. And I am wondering if that is a precursor to Shardplate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think you are a very smart man and you are asking wise questions.
