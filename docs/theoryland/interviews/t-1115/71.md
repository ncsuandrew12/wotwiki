# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #71](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#71)

#### Question

Can a kandra burn things...could they burn lerasium...and if they did would they be able to burn other things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes that is possible. It is even plausible that an kandra could gain other powers, they just donâ€™t know how to do it.
