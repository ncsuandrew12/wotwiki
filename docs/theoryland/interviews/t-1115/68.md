# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #68](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#68)

#### Question

Do you always stick to your outline?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not. I will rebuild my outline. If I think I’m gonna break it, I’ll try a chapter that direction and if it works rewrite the outline.

#### Question

Do you ever refer back to your previous book …?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Definitely. Usually I make an outline for the first book, write it, then outline the series.
