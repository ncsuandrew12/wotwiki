# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #66](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#66)

#### Question

I had a question about how the Alethi women exhibit their wealth through their dresses. So I know there’s embroidery in the fabric [that you’re kinda disabling one arm?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So the gemstones -- like well cut gemstones and then fill them with Stormlight. The glowing is how they’d shown off their wealth.

#### Question

What kind of embroidery is it? Flowers? Patterns?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a lot of things but the Alethi’s don’t do the flower thing....It’s not really an Alethi thing. So you are seeing a lot of designs and hatchings. They may look a little Arabic to you. Or the glyphs and things like that you will see worked in but very stylized.
