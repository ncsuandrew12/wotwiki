# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #51](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#51)

#### Question

One thing I wanted to ask about is the [test?] on Emperor’s Soul, are you going to write a bigger one about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s unlikely because I think it works so well as it is. But you will probably see Shai again at some point.
