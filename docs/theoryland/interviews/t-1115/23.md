# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#23)

#### Question

So I’m asking a question for my little sister. So since Disneyland is taking over the world, Disneyland is obviously Librarians. So is Alcatraz ever going to visit Disneyland?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh that’s a good question. He should because Disneyland is totally Librarians. They totally run that. I will consider that. I will consider that. Good question. Alcatraz 5 is written. We’re re-releasing the Alcatraz books with new covers and new artwork and all sorts of cool things like that starting January next year and they’ll run straight through to the fifth book which will come out in the summer sometime.
