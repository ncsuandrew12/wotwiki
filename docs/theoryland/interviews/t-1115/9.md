#### Question

In Words of Radiance you have a great line which said “careful planning is the water which nourishes creativity”. I was wondering if, when you wrote that line, were you specifically thinking about novel outlines?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So there’s a line in Words of Radiance that’s says “careful planning is the water which nourishes creativity”. Was I specifically thinking of outlines? So when I speak most lines like this, I’m trying to speak through someone’s eyes. That’s Navani I believe who says that am I right? The idea being that that’s the way they’d perceive it. There are other people who would disagree. Now I am a planner, so I understand that mindset a lot. I use a lot of outlines. There are other people who don’t plan at all and their books still turn out awesome. So I think there are a lot of different ways to be creative. But I don’t think that Navani thinks that there are a lot of different ways. If that makes any sense. She has a different perspective on it perhaps.
