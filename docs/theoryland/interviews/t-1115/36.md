# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#36)

#### Question

What has been your most favorite character arc to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um… Normally it’s very hard to answer questions like this because it’s like all my characters are my favorites, but in this case I can say writing Perrin’s arc in the Wheel of Time was very satisfying and fulfilling since I’ve been a fan for so many years and being able to do the things there, yeah. That was very satisfying, how about that?
