# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#34)

#### Question

When spren die, they kind of become part of everything, so why did, when the Knights broke their oaths, why did they stay as Shardblades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They had been bound into that form by those oaths. The oaths are broken, but it’s like they’re cracked. Does that make sense? Like, there’s still something holding those spren and that’s what made them [?] It would have been better if they had actually died, does that make sense? But they couldn’t, they’re bound in that form.

#### Question

But their consciousness is gone-?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They still have a consciousness some- to an extent.

#### Question

That’s why the screaming happens.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
