# [Interview #1115: Firefight Tour - El Cerrito, CA, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1115#13)

#### Question

Last month you posted a picture of your Dropbox right and there is that one folder that we read about. Is there anything you can tell us about that yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So I posted a picture of my Dropbox and I just happened to have crossed out one of the folders. Ahm, what can I say about that...you’ll know eventually. There’s not a whole lot i can say about it because it’s mere existence is a spoiler to people who haven’t read certain other books. And so that’s the reason why I crossed it out.

#### Question

We can assume it’s Cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can’t say either way. It’s mere existence is a spoiler. You will find out eventually, but it is definitely a little side project that I may or may not actually ever finish.
