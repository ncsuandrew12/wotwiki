#### KiManiak

This may be RAFO bait, but let’s see. Did the Knights Radiant in Dalinar’s Feverstone Keep vision divest their discard their Shards to a specific person/being/entity? (Brandon interrupted here before I could finish, but I’ll include the rest anyway). If so, have we seen them onscreen as of the end of WoR?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a definite RAFO. (And that’s how I earned my first official RAFO card).
