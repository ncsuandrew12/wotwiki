*Warbreaker*
was great, do you feel it benefited from online publishing? And would you publish that way again? It struck me that online publication is a great way to start a series, the first book is free then we are hooked.

I don’t know if it helped, but it certainly didn’t hurt. I’ll do it again, probably for the
*Warbreaker*
sequel.
