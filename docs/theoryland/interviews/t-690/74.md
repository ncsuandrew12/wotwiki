#### Danbarbour

I just finished
*Warbreaker*
and need a new book to read. I always have trouble picking a book. Any suggestions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Gave some book suggestions below. If you havenâ€™t read Pratchett, Guards Guards is another good place to begin. I liked
*Servant of a Dark God*
, coming out from Tor next month, I believe. Also,
*Crystal Rain*
by Tobias Buckell and
*A Fire Upon the Deep*
by Vernor Vinge are great.
