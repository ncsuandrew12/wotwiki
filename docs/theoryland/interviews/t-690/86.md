What kind of average pagecount were you able to put out daily when working as a part time writer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was a special case, as I intentionally picked a job where I could write at work. I shot for 2000 words a day. I suggest to new writers that 2k a week be a minimum. That gives you a book in about a year.
