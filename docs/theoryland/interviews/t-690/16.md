#### Emma

Will there be an Intro (explanation) at
*The Gathering Storm*
? Which explains the three books for people who aren't online?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wrote a foreword for the book explaining my involvement and the three book split. We were going to have Harriet do it, but the time grew tight, so I did it and had her revise it.
