Would you be willing to take bribes to start
*Nightblood*
before finishing WoT!?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Heh.
*Nightblood*
will happen someday. Bribes of cookies or Magic Cards at signings might help. More seriously, I do intend to do this—and post it online as I write it—but it probably won’t be for a few years.

#### rrjr010

Then you shall have both when you come here this winter. Help turn a few years into six months, right?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

lol. Well, it can’t hurt. But I DO have a lot on my plate... We’ll see. I want an
*Elantris*
sequel out for 2015.

#### rrjr010

Wow, an
*Elantris*
sequel would be awesome too. Where would it fit chronologically after the end of
*Elantris*
?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

*Elantris*
direct sequel would be 10 years later and use Kiin’s children as viewpoint characters living in Fjorden.
