#### Graendal

Did you ever notice how similar Graendal and Blushweaver are in personality?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn’t until I started work on the WoT book. I wrote
*Warbreaker*
years before I was offered the WoT. I noticed and laughed. RJ’s books are dug pretty deeply into my subconscious. I think they’re very different as characters, but Graendal was obviously an influence on Blushweaver.
