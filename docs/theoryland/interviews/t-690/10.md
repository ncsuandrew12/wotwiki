Brandon, how do you think
*The Way of Kings*
will read as a complete set with your voice in the last books? Did you plan ahead for that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Short answer is yes. Weâ€™ll see if I can pull it off. Original plans for my series was for a 36 book arc. I thought that would intimidate readers. But the secret answer is this: People ask for an
*Elantris*
sequel. There is one. It is called Mistborn.
