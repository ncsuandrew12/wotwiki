Do you read Stephen King? Also, which fantasy tomes would you absolutely recommend reading?

#### Brandon Sanderson

King is amazing. Truly a brilliant writer. If anyone hasn’t read, try
*The Stand*
or a short story collection. I suggest
*Name of the Wind*
,
*Dragonsbane*
, or anything by Pratchett. Particualrly
*The Truth*
. I like Jordan (duh) McCaffrey and Rawn a lot too. Williams’s
*Sorrow and Thorn*
is great. Others:
*Tigana*
, or anything by Kay really,
*Sabriel*
by Nix, and
*The Golden Compass*
are all excellent.
