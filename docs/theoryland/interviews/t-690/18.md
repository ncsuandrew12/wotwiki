Can you offer us anything at all on the status of
*The Eye of the World*
movie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don’t have much time to keep an eye (no pun intended) on the movie too closely. The producer was at JordanCon, though, and I was put at ease somewhat by speaking with him. As far as I know, it’s still in preproduction an in the scriptwriting stage. When they have a script, I’ll ask if I can read it. Maria, RJ’s assistant, is in charge of that. I’ve got my hands full writing the books!
