Can Hoid travel through worlds? Or, in other words, are all of your "Hoids" one person?

Well, "Hoid" the name is an alias that a certain person is using, and he stole it from someone else. But the person named Hoid in
*Elantris*
, Mistborn, and
*Warbreaker*
are all the same individual. For the record, this is not a "name cameo." This is, indeed, the very same person.
