Any talks of writing other novels based on Robert Jordan's world: The Age of Legends, the 4th Age...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RJ was very uncomfortable with the idea of people writing in his world. I want to respect that. You might see the Outriggers or the two prequels he planned to write. But no Age of Legends or Hawkwing. At least, that has been my suggestion to Harriet. It is her call.

#### Graendal

Yes! Please do what you can to get the prequels or outriggers published once you've finished writing
