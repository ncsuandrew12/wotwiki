#### Graendal

How do you feel about the degeneration of Rand and Egwene's relationship? Could Amyrlin and Dragon work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think it was one of the best things RJ did. It played with our expectations in a great way. And I think Rand has his hands plenty full right now without adding Egwene back in. They have gone different directions in life. It was quite well done, though sad.
