Loving
*Warbreaker*
! How do you write women characters so well?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A mixture of helpful women friends and a lot of early failures. I’ve found the biggest problem with writing the opposite gender comes when you add them simply be a love interest. Nobody is just a love interest in their own minds. Make them a character first, a plot device second.

#### MOSSJON

Even
*Elantris*
had a great woman character. So you must be hiding the early failures. And that is why/how you succeed so well. Kudos!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Early failures were in the books that didn’t get published. (
*White Sand*
’s female lead was cringe-worthy.)
