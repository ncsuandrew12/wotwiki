What is the largest battle you ever fought with your editor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was about Lightsong. He and I disagreed on some of the humor. Oddly, we were both right. He was claiming Lightsong wasnâ€™t funny. What he meant was that I was allowing the humor to undermine setting. We came to a balance, and I think that Lightsong is much better for it.

#### Footnote

Brandon actually
[asked his fans](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/655/Lightsong-LoversHaters-Speak-Out!)
to chime in.
