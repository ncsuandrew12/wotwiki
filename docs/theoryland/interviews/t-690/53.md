As a RJ fan who has never read any of your literature, which of your books should I start reading today?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’d suggest Mistborn first.
*Warbreaker*
wouldn’t be a bad place to start either, as it’s a stand alone. Mistborn (the first book is called
*The Final Empire*
) is a complete trilogy. RJ readers tend to like series.
