Brandon, how do you think WoT will read as a complete set with your voice in the last books? Did you plan ahead for that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I tried very hard. The characters should read right, the plot should read right. I think it will read cohesive. These books will not go off on random tangents. In fact, Iâ€™m hoping that the narrative will feel like a shift back toward 4/5/6, which are my favorite WoT books.
