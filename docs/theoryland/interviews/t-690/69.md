What's next for you after finishing TWOT? Any new worlds in store, or going back to your other ones?

Next is getting WoT 13&14, along with the final
*Alcatraz*
book. After that,
*The Way of Kings*
2. Then, finally, I’ll be able to do some new worlds. I’ve got two in particular I really want to visit.
