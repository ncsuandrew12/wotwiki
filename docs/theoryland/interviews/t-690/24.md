#### Graendal

A question that's been on my mind for a while. If Returned can't have children, how are Siri and Vivenna descended from one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excellent question. One I have to RAFO. When I was writing
*Warbreaker*
, I was planning on two books. I seeded two questions to be answered in the next book. One was the origin of the royal family. The second was how Vasher was able to survive while hiding his divine Breath. I will answer these questions. Eventually. (It has to do with restoring Breath and life to the child while still in the womb.).
