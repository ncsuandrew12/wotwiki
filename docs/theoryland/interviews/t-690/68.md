#### Danbarbour

Out of everything that you have written, what would you say is your favorite and/or most proud of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Gathering Storm*
is, by far, the best—and most difficult—thing I’ve written. It’s what I’m most proud of. For what is published, though,
*Warbreaker*
has the best writing of anything I’ve done.
