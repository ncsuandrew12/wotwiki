#### Meeeeech

Who would win this three way fight? Vin vs. Vasher vs. Lan? I vote Vin...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on how much metal Vin has, how many Breaths Vasher has, and if Lan can get the jump on them. Probably Vin, though Rand would blow her out of the water.

#### MEEEEECH

P.S. Vin would lure Rand to Far Madding and take him down.
