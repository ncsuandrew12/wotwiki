#### Feifner

Who is your favorite character from
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Favorite character is Lightsong. I had long wanted to do a character who would have fit in an Oscar Wilde play. If you want to cast Rupert Everett as Lightsong in your head, feel free. [Mistake on Brandon's part? This was the closest match I found.]
