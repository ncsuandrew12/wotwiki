Would you ever, if given the chance, do screenwriting, for television or for a film?

#### Brandon Sanderson

For instance, I did the initial screenplay concept treatments for
*Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians*
. Thatâ€™s what got the book sold to Dreamworks Animation. (2013, hopefully. Fingers crossed.) I might do other film screenplays. Not really interested in Television.
