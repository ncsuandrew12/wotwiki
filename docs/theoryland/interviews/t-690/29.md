What first gave you the idea for
*Warbreaker*
? What was your first inspiration for it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Warbreaker*
came from a lot of sources. Siri and Vivenna were side characters in a book I never finished. Vasher came from the line that starts the book. No space to post it here, but give it a read. Nightblood came because...well, I just wanted to have a talking sword.
