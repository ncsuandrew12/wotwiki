#### Thistledown

Any plans for a kindle
*Elantris*
version? Is
*The Way of Kings*
slated for 2010 along with WoT book 2? Now that you've revised WoK, do you think you'll release two books next year (WoT and
*The Way of Kings*
)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, if we can get Amazon to pay attention. (Grr.) And yes, two books next year.
*The Way of Kings*
and WoT13. 2011 will probably have just one, though. I don’t know if I’ll be able to write the
*Way of Kings*
sequel in time.
