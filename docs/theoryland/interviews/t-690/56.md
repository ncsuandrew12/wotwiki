When working with new characters, how do you keep their voices straight in the early writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It can be hard. I often have to rewrite my first chapters after the book is finished. Practice by having four very different character ride through the same town, but see very different things.

#### starrylites

Thanks, Brandon! I think I"m going to have to do just that on my currently project; having character meshing problems.
