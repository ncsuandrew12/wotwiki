#### Theodor89

What tone will
*The Way of Kings*
have? Darker or lighter then your previous work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My goal is to blend some of the wit in
*Warbreaker*
with darker edge of Mistborn. It certainly won’t be lighter. But there should be moments when you laugh. The greatest authors out there—RJ and Martin come to mind—can do both at the same time.
