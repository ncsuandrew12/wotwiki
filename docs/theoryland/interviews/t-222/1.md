# [Interview #222: KOD Signing Report - Bill Ford, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=222#1)

#### Bill Ford

My wife and I attended the RJ book signing at Books-A-Million in the Arundel Mills Mall in Hanover, MD last evening. It was supposed to start at 1900 hours (EST), but Mr. Jordan was late because two tunnels under the Baltimore Harbor were closed due to a terrorist threat. (Thankfully, nothing has materialized from that!) When he arrived, he made only a few remarks before starting signing, paraphrases follow.

#### Robert Jordan

He gave a few name pronunciations. He said that he would write two more “prequel novellas” AFTER finishing the next and final book of the series proper. He said that he had vowed that he would never again write in the WOT universe unless he could come up with something really original/unique. He said that he is CONSIDERING two side-line stories in the WOT universe, but will have to think about it for a year or two to see if they are worthwhile.
