# [Interview #222: KOD Signing Report - Bill Ford, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=222#3)

#### Bill Ford

I found him to be warm, friendly, and down to earth. It was the first time I had met him. My wife met him at a signing for his last book, but I was out of town at the time. I may post some of the pictures if I didn’t break the camera. My wife hasn’t downloaded them from the memory card yet as we didn’t get home until late last night.

It was DEFINITELY worth the wait!
