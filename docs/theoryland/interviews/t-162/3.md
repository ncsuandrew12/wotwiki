# [Interview #162: COT Signing Report - Michael Martin, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=162#3)

#### Robert Jordan

About that Asmodean thing...my impression is that during the last signing tour (not in a mailed letter), someone gave him a "correct" theory on who did it. He did not confirm it to the person then, nor will he now tell us what happened. Much spirited debate followed in the crowd.
