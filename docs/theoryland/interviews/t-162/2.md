# [Interview #162: COT Signing Report - Michael Martin, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=162#2)

#### Robert Jordan

When he said he was aiming for two more books, someone from the crowd yelled out "Make it 15 or 20!" meaning, I think, 15 or 20 books total for the series. RJ dramatically looked to the ceiling and abjured the Creator to not listen. He then said he was Anglican, and was therefore allowed to talk to God. Has anyone ever read or heard anything about his religious background? Just curious.
