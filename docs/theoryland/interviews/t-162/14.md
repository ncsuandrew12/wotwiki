# [Interview #162: COT Signing Report - Michael Martin, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=162#14)

#### Michael Martin

Sadly, I had to leave early—had a relative flying into town and I had to get to the airport and pick them up. So my copies of
*The Great Hunt*
and
*The Fires of Heaven*
are still unsigned; everything else is.

Thanks to Matthew and Tim—this would have been much longer without their reports, and they picked up on a lot I either missed or dismissed, as having heard it many times.
