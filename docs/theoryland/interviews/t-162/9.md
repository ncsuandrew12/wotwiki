# [Interview #162: COT Signing Report - Michael Martin, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=162#9)

#### Michael Martin

Why didn't Rand kill Padan Fain when he spotted him at the rebels' camp in
*A Crown of Swords*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Rand was there to reach out to the rebels, and killing Fain would not have been productive, and Rand is not a fool. (I had to stifle quite a few comments at that answer.)
