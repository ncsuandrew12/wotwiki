# [Interview #230: KOD Signing Report - Steve, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=230#3)

#### Steve

When the book signing time came I gave him two pens from my campground. He asked if I wanted my books signed with them and I mumbled something about "no, just in case you run out of ink" and completely forgot to invite him to come camp for free should he ever be back in Ohio and feel the need for some adventure (my park is 10 minutes from Kings Island—a roller coaster paradise). After that I was spun out by the crowd, watched for a bit, and then we left.

So went our meeting with Mr. Jordan in Dayton, Ohio's Books and Company store...
