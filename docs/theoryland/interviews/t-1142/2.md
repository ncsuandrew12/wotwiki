In the Final Empire, Kelsier says that it will take 300 years before atium grows back in the Pits of Hathsin. How does he know this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think it is mentioned somewhere else how long it takes a crystal to regrow, and he's just basing it on the past, when a crystal is damaged, how long it takes one to come back. I'm pretty sure that that is even mentioned somewhere, but if not, that's just how he knows.
