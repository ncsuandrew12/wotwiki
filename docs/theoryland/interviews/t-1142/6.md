#### BlackYeti

You've said before that the Horneaters are hybrids, half-human...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really half any more, but yeah.

#### BlackYeti

Are there any other hybrid creatures, would you consider the Koloss-blodded to be this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really, I don't consider them, but the Herdazians also have a bit of Parshendi in them.
