# [Interview #675: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#13)

#### Zas

I’ve got a question kind of based off of the train fight. If you have a time bubble, and you were to make it while you are on the train, would the time bubble move with the train, or would it stay at the same spot relative to the planet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Time bubbles don’t move, so it would pull you out of it, then it would vanish.

#### MI'CHELLE

If you were to pop up a time bubble and someone were to be stuck halfway in and halfway out, would they go splooch?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No, they would be in the time bubble. The time bubbles will move with the planet but not with the train.

#### AUDIENCE

Yeah, I always thought it was relative to the person creating the time bubble.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No, you’ll see Wayne create one, then he’ll walk up to the perimeter, but if he leaves it, it ruins the time bubble.

#### ZAS

So is that because it’s linked up to the spiritual gravitational bond between the planet?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, and you’re digging very deeply into stuff that I now can’t answer. Time bubbles have some weirdness to them that I don’t want to dig in too deeply, but yes.
