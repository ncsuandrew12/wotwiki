# [Interview #675: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#2)

#### Zas (Terez)

Robert Jordan often said that he intended to plant a 'hook' in the last scene, a teaser for an unresolved issue. Was this 'hook' something he planned to explore in the outriggers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, and he actually wrote that part. You'll see it when the book comes out, and it's one of the lines that will go in unchanged. Sorry!
