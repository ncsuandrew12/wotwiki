# [Interview #675: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#20)

#### Question

Which I did catch was very entertaining to see like that [regarding the Aluminum Hats].

#### Brandon Sanderson

I built aluminum to do all sorts of funky things to all the powers, and I actually hadn’t made the connection of tinfoil hats until after I’d built it in, and I was writing it in
*Alloy of Law*
, years after I built it in, saying “Wait a minute! I just put tinfoil hats in the book!” (laughter) So I actually built that without thinking that there would be a joke to that.
