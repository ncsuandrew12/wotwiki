# [Interview #675: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#19)

#### Member of Audience

Also speaking of continutiy...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh—oh.

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

THis is a very very minor spoiler. It's just a statement that was made in
*Alloy of Law*
, that Smokers could...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Oh yeah, that was just a typo.

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

Is that going to change things?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Wait, go ahead and say it.

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

Can Copperclouds shield others' emotions?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Oh okay. Did we put that in
*Alloy of Law*
in the Ars Arcanum? Is that wwhere you read it?

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

I forget. I don't remember where it is.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I believe it’s in the Ars Arcanum, which in
*Alloy of Law*
was put together by Peter. And that’s mostly a mistake, though the thing is the Role Playing Game came to me and said “Is it feasible that this could happen?” And I said “It’s perhaps feasible, but only a very rare individual could make this work if they knew exactly what they were doing.” And so I said “Yeah, go ahead, but make it a power that someone really has to know what they’re doing to make it work.” And so they put it in, and so Peter assumed that it was canon, that anyone can do it, but that’s not what I intended.

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

So would it be easier to say that somebody discovered they could do it and now they are training copperclouds to do it?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I would say that it is viable that someone could figure it out, but it would be a very difficult thing to train, and it is not a common Coppercloud—A common Coppercloud isn’t going to be able to be doing it, and almost no Mistborn will ever be capable of doing it, they just don’t focus on that metal enough to learn it. Of course, there aren’t Mistborn around anymore. So it is a possible power, it is plausible, but it is not the standard. Perhaps I will allow it to become the standard eventually, but it’s not right now. It would be much easier to wear a tinfoil hat. (laughter) Aluminum, aluminum. Which does work.
