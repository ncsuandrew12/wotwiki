# [Interview #675: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#11)

#### Question

People are going crazy wondering if there are telegraphs and telephones in
*Alloy of Law*
. Are there? And if not, why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are not yet. And the reason why is because they haven’t needed them yet. Necessity is the, what the fuel of invention?

#### MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

The mother of invention.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, the mother of invention, and they have messengers who run, Coinshots who are very fast. They also do basically don’t need to go outside the City, and haven’t for a long time. They’re close, but they haven’t invented them yet for the same reason that they have very poor navigation techniques. Why do you need to ship anything or sail anywhere when you have some idyllic paradise to live in? And you have allomancers, who in some ways are preventing from achieving that next level, because a Coinshot can get it there really fast, and so you’re only waiting a few minutes for them to come back with your message, so it can actually stifle a little bit of technology by having a not-quite-as-good magical solution.
