# [Interview #675, Entry #26]: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#26)

#### Question

How long before is the game going to be? I remember you saying it was going to be before Final Empire, but I was wondering how long before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I sold
*Legion*
, which is a novella I wrote, to Lionsgate, for a television pilot. We will see if they will actually do it or not. That’s a modern day thriller I wrote. It’s a novella. I’ll release it next summer or something. It’s short, but it was meant for a pitch for a television show. So that’s coming out, and we’ll hope that they actually film that. We did sign deals on that, and since there’s Lionsgate, which is a big studio, behind that, there’s a production house attached to it, and it will go much faster.

Other than that, there’s the Wheel of Time, which keeps slowly moving forward. It is moving forward, but really slowly. And Alcatraz is basically dead in the water right now. The option lapsed in June, and no one else has snatched it up, so it’s now been six months, and that one’s pretty much dead in the water. Which is sad. We got really close on that one.

#### QUESTION

Will you still write the fifth book?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, I will write the fifth book. Just the movie is dead in the water.
