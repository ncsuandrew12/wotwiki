#### Question

Is AonDor Physical, Spiritual, or Cognitive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, I wasnâ€™t expecting that. (laughter) Are you a Sharder?

#### SAME MEMBER OF AUDIENCE

A little bit. (laughter)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

AonDor is mixed up in all three. So I would say more Cognitive and Spiritual than it is Physical, but it is mixed up in all three.
