#### Question

I've heard rumors of a Mistborn movie. Is that true?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Mistborn movie, is not even up to handshakes now. We do have a Vin chosen, but it’s not official yet, so I can’t say who it is.

#### QUESTION

I've heard rumors. Will you confirm or deny this?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

What rumor?

#### QUESTION

Linsey Lohan?

(Wild laughter)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, I can deny that one. (Continued Laughter) It's not Paris Hilton's dog either.

Yeah, basically it’s where it’s been at for a while, which is we’re at a good version of the screenplay, we’re trying now to get people to look at it in Hollywood.
