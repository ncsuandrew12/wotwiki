# [Interview #675: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zas, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=675#12)

#### Question

So Ruin and Preservation combine. When Odium slays the Shardbearers, why doesnâ€™t he absorb the enemy Shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because that would actually change the way he views the world. The Shard would actually start to influence him, and could actually ruin who he views himself as being. So instead of combining them all, his goal is to destroy them all and be the only one left at his power level.

#### QUESTION

So by his nature, he can't combine?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I mean he could, but it would change his nature. So he won't.
