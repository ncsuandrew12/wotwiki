#### Brandon Sanderson

**The Process**

The first thing I did upon receiving the notes was dive back into a reread of the series, notes in hand, looking for foreshadowing that I needed to fulfill and character arcs that were incomplete. You can read my book-by-book reactions; I posted them as
[a sequence of blog posts](http://brandonsanderson.com/tag/the-wheel-of-time-read-through/)
in 2008 as I was rereading.

This took months, and I built for myself a large file of questions, potential scenes, and ideas while reading. My next visit to Charleston was in the spring of 2008. (April, perhaps? I don't recall exactly.) I was nearing the end of my reread, though I don't believe I was quite finished yet.
