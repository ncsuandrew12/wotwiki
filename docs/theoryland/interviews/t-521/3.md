# [Interview #521: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Updates, THE WAY OF KINGS ARC Giveaway, Tour, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=521#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tor has announced
[the book tour for
*The Way of Kings*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/06/brandon-sandersons-the-way-of-kings-tour-announced)
. I'll also be adding all the signings to my Events page and clearing up a few details such as: Which Barnes & Noble in Orlando? Which Powell's in the Portland area? I'll probably post the full details tomorrow.
Tor is also doing a
[giveaway of 40 copies](http://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/show/4502-the-way-of-kings)
of the uncorrected advance reading copy (and when it says uncorrected, it means it!)
[of
*The Way of Kings*
via Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/show/4502-the-way-of-kings)
. Last I checked, 601 people had entered. That's still better odds than most contests. Now, Tor only has distribution rights for the U.S., which means this contest is restricted to U.S. residents. I'm considering ways for my non-U.S. fans to have a chance to get their hands on a copy.
