And if you've been following me on

, you know that today I finished writing the final chapter (or rather, the last chapter I had left to write, which is not right at the end of the book) of
*Towers of Midnight*
. Now it goes off to Team Jordan for feedback, and I start into the revisions that will be required before the book can go into production less than two months from now. It's going to be tight, but we'll pull it off.
