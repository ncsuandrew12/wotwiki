# [Interview #963: Odds and Ends with Brandon and Maria, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=963#1)

#### Terez

This is a short email interview with Brandon and Maria. On the first question, he's managed to slip it into a few Q&As (which I suggested) since I asked him about it, so not much new there. The other two questions he wanted to pass through Maria for comment, so her responses are included here too. My questions are paraphrased because this was actually the result of a conversation that was too complicated to summarize faithfully. Brandon's and Maria's responses are verbatim.
