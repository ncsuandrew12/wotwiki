Do you ever plan to use bio‐chroma again? It'd be a shame to see such an interesting and original idea left with a single book.

It is unlikely that I will use this magic system in a different book because it is distinctly tied to that particular Shard. The sequel likelihood is good. There is more to tell in this world, so there is a decent chance I will return and do a second
*Warbreaker*
book (I've been calling it
*Nightblood*
when I've mentioned it before). That isn't to say that there will never be magic systems that will repeat across series—in fact there's a decent chance that will happen—but I'm not going to say any more on that right now.
