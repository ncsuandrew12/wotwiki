# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#12)

#### Robert

All your novels are tied together by an overarching magic system, and we usualy see evidence of this in the form of the too-still pools of water. However we did not see any such bodies of water directly in
*Warbreaker*
. Is there such a pool in
*Warbreaker*
? Is that where the Tears of Edgli grow?

Wow. I've got some very perceptive readers.

This is speculation that I will neither confirm nor deny.
