# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#13)

#### Skyler

If a returned gives away his/her breath they die right? So why doesn't Vasher die after he gives his to Denth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They will die the moment they run out of breath to harvest. Once a week their body needs a breath in order to survive. Each Returned has one single superpowered breath. Imagine it as one breath that propels them up through the Heightenings, but it is only a single breath. It's what we speak of in Shard world terminology as a Splinter. And when the seventh day comes, if a Returned does not have another breath for his body to consume to keep him alive, his body will actually eat his divine breath and kill him. So they don't die immediately after they get rid of the breath, they're sort of put into a state of limbo where if they don't find more breath by the time that their feast day comes, then they will die. (Vasher did not give his Returned breath to Denth, just a number of normal breaths.)
