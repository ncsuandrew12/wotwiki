# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#21)

#### Christina

My question: What exactly does the Mistborn sequel series entail?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/264132-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson?page=2#comment_14422838)

Several hundred years after the original trilogy—Spoiler alert!—Wait, aren't these questions supposed to be about
*Warbreaker*
?

Anyway, the Mistborn sequel trilogy, as I've said before, takes place in a more technologically advanced version of the world, several hundred years later. They've progressed beyond steam technology to combustion engine technology, are building skyscrapers ;mdash; that level of technology. It will follow the exploits of a team of Allomancers who are kind of like an Allomantic SWAT team, a group of hybrid mercenary/deputized individuals who are brought in by the police to take out Allomancer criminals. The first book will deal with when they are called in to deal with a Mistborn serial killer. That's how it starts. It will go bizarre from there, of course, but think guns, cars, skyscrapers, and Allomancers.

#### Footnote

This trilogy that he's talking about is after the
*Alloy of Law*
.
