# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#7)

#### Logan

I really enjoyed
*Warbreaker*
, especially the history of the Scholars and their relationships. Have you considered writing a prequel novel that would take place when Vasher, et al were much younger?

People ask me for prequels all the time. They've asked for Mistborn prequels,
*Elantris*
prequels, and now
*Warbreaker*
prequels. My general answer to this is probably not—just because I as a reader don't like prequels. I'm one of those readers that if the ending is spoiled for me, in many ways that can ruin the book. Because of that it's hard for me to decide to write a prequel.

When I plan my books I design them to have a beginning, a middle, an end, and a past and a future. I know what happened in the past. I know what will happen in the future. I could always write that, and I won't rule it out 100% completely. But telling the story of the Five Scholars is not something I sat down to do with
*Warbreaker*
. I had that all worked out; I knew what they did. The exciting story I wanted to tell is the one that happened in the book. There is a good chance of a sequel, but a prequel is unlikely. If I did do a prequel it would probably be in short story form posted for free on my website.
