# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#19)

#### David

Do you plan to annotate Warbreaker?

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/264132-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson?page=2#comment_14422814)

I've written annotations for WARBREAKER already. There is supposed to be a special edition WARBREAKER e-book from Tor.com coming that will include all the annotations right there with the text, but I'm not sure when it will appear. The annotations will still go up chapter-by-chapter on my website, but if you get the special edition e-book you can have them all at once. We'll see when that happens.

#### Footnote

Since this post, the special edition hasn't been mentioned. But you can read all of his Warbreaker annotations.
