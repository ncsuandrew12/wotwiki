# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#15)

While I loved Mistborn and am excited to see you optioned the film rights already, I think that Warbreaker would translate to film even more easily/successfully

So I guess my question is, do you agree that Warbreaker will translate to film better? Did you discuss this with the Paloppa Guys? Which of your works do you think is most "marketable" as a medium—to—big—budget film?

I think the magic system of
*Warbreaker*
is certainly better suited to film than a lot of the MISTBORN magic system. However, I think the plot and storytelling of
*Mistborn*
— because of the action/adventure style of it — would translate better to film. Story structure—wise,
*Mistborn*
, particularly the first book, is probably the best book-to-film translation I think I've got. I think
*Warbreaker*
would make a wonderful graphic novel, and someday I would love to sell rights to it in that medium. And certainly if we make a
*Mistbron*
film, the metals would have to work in a very different way. They would probably be understated in the film itself.
