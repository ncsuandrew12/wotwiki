# [Interview #680: Goodreads Fantasy Book Discussion Warbreaker Q&A, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=680#3)

I really loved the character Lightsong, he was my favorite and probably one of the most interesting characters I've ever read about. Did you have anyone in particular in mind when you came up with him? How did go about developing him as a character?

Rupert Everett was sitting in the back of my mind.

Actually, in order to develop Lightsong's character well, I didn't want to imitate any one voice. That's something we always stay away from. But I had been wanting to work on writing humor in a different way from what I'd previously used. I spent a lot of time watching and analyzing the movie
*The Thin Man*
, the old comedy/mystery/crime film with an emphasis on very witty characters making wisecracks as they investigate a murder. If you haven't seen it, it's delightful. Along with
*An Ideal Husband*
and
*The Importance of Being Earnest*
, those were my three sources of inspiration. I was trying for a blend of those two styles—and then of course added my own sense of humor.
