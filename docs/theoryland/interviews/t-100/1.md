# [Interview #100, Entry #1]: TPOD Signing Report - Melinda Yin](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=100#1)

#### Melinda Yin

I was at the signing at King of Prussia last night, and asked a question about Randland life that has been bugging me for a while—do Aes Sedai ever have children, and why/why not?

#### Robert Jordan

I was impressed with Jordan's casual reply, as if this were common knowledge—that all Aes Sedai, and for that matter, most women have knowledge of a special herb that serves as an incredibly efficient contraceptive. This herb is just general women's lore, passed to women by Wisdoms and such.

He followed up with two other points : 1) Aes Sedai are personally discouraged from having children because they know they will outlive them, and 2) it's clearly not a popular idea because the White Ajah had suggested having children with men who can channel in order to undo "culling", but this suggestion was not particularly well received.
