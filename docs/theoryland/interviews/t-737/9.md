# [Interview #737: La Repubblica - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=737#9)

#### Dario Olivero

You were in Vietnam, you know war. What do you think of Bush's war? Is it good versus evil? Was it avoidable?

#### Robert Jordan

This morning I read in the paper that a mass grave has been found in Iraq in which there were three thousand bodies. Saddam Hussein murdered them, murdered his people. Yes I think it was a war of good against evil. That was evil.
