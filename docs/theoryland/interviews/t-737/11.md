# [Interview #737: La Repubblica - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=737#11)

#### Dario Olivero

You are an extraordinarily prolific writer and have recently surpassed the standing of a giant like Stephen King. Do you work as much as him and so methodically as to touch upon obsession?

#### Robert Jordan

My method is very simple: I read the newspaper at breakfast, I go to my desk, replying to e-mails to which I must answer and ignore the rest. I begin to write and go on for seven or eight hours. If I remember lunch, otherwise straight through. Seven days a week. But I must say that if I want to go fishing, I drop everything and go.
