# [Interview #737: La Repubblica - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=737#4)

#### Dario Olivero

#### Robert Jordan

I believe that for every writer the maximum degree of identification is necessary. So it can happen that I'm writing in my home with my wife in the house a few steps away from me doing more normal things while I'm engrossed in appalling characters.
