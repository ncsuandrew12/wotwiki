# [Interview #28: KOD Signing Report - Pary, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=28#1)

#### Pary

Just a very brief update on some of the questions asked during RJ's signing in Midtown. Not very many questions were asked, surprisingly. And he was packing to leave at about 1:50pm [for a signing that began at 12:30pm].

#### Robert Jordan

Perhaps the most startling revelation was that he has been in talks about doing "2 or 3" extra WOT books beyond the final installment and the prequels. They would focus on subsidiary characters we have encountered.
