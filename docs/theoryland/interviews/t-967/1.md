# [Interview #967: AMOL Signing Report - GardenGnome, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=967#1)

#### GardenGnome

I was at the Toronto signing, dressed as an Aes Sedai of the Purple Ajah (if anyone recognizes the old Verin theory about the Light counterpart to the Black Ajah (I think Sanderson recognized it when I explained it)).

There was also a Mat cosplayer, If he is reading this I have one of your dagger and would like to return it.

The opening questions were explaining how he got chosen and the standard questions that are in the interview database.

There was no Harriet and no RAFO cards. :( But I did get a
*Memory of Light*
bag (got lots of tickets from answering trivia).

The answers to my questions, the WOT one asked circumspectly to avoid spoilers:
