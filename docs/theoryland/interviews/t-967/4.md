# [Interview #967: AMOL Signing Report - GardenGnome, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=967#4)

#### GardenGnome

I somehow ended up mentioning that I answered the trick trivia question on Nakomi, I told him I said my personal theory and that Brandon wasn't allowed to answer any questions about her.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He then asked what my theory was (-with an obvious poker face on-), I said that I found it obvious that Nakomi is the Creator (he goes mmmhmm). Then one of the Memory Keepers remarks "But Bela is the Creator!" to which I came up with the new theory that Nakomi is the Creator because Rand wouldn't be able to handle a talking horse.
