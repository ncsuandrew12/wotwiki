# [Interview #146: Dragonmount Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146#2)

#### Dragonmount

Do you often correct inconsistencies in the books? Or does Robert do it himself?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

No, I don't correct inconsistencies. Robert has a wonderful assistant, Maria Simons, who helps enormously in this regard, together with her sidekick Alan Romanczuk. Robert writes long lists of questions for them, and they come up with the answers in time, so that inconsistencies mostly just don't happen. Maria also checks all proper nouns in the manuscript against our own super-glossary, and picks up the occasional glitch that way.
