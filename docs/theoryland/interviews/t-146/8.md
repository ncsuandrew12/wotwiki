# [Interview #146: Dragonmount Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146#8)

#### Dragonmount

What is your reaction to Robert telling people that all of the major female characters are partially based off of you? Doesn't that worry you a bit?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

No, it doesn't worry me. I am immensely flattered by it. And a bit amused. The cross wife who says, "you forgot to take the garbage out again": Is this REALLY Moghedien? Goodness!
