# [Interview #146: Dragonmount Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146#10)

#### Dragonmount

Who are some of your favorite poets?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Galway Kinnell!!!! And Sharon Olds, and Mary Oliver, and John M. Ford and John O'Donohue. I've just bought James Tate to read, because of a yummy poem called "Teaching the Ape to Write Poems". A friend has just given me Marina Tsvetaeva, but I haven't read her yet. I also want to read some more Billy Collins. Among the dead white males, I really like Tennyson and Hopkins. And of course Shakespeare.
