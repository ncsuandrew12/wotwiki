# [Interview #146: Dragonmount Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146#6)

#### Dragonmount

Your husband once commented that he could walk into the room and you would know who he was writing about. If this is true, do you ever make him wait outside until he can stop being someone, for example, Padan Fain?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, I don't know EXACTLY who he's been writing, but if he's been writing somebody awful, like Padan, yes, I do know it. I never make him wait outside. I just hug him and give him a kiss, and he generally shakes himself like a retriever and begins to come out of it.
