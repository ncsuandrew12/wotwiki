# [Interview #146: Dragonmount Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146#9)

#### Dragonmount

We've heard that you enjoy reading and writing poetry. Is that just a hobby for yourself, or has your stuff been published? If so, where can we find it?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

I have just begun (in January of this year) submitting stuff, and so far poems of mine have been accepted by
*Eureka Literary Magazine*
(ELM),
*Another Chicago Magazine*
, and
*Confrontation*
. I think
*Another Chicago Magazine*
will be out first, some time this winter, with a poem called "North Georgia Woods". Other poems are on submission all over the place. I'm having a wonderful time with this!
