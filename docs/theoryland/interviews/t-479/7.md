# [Interview #479, Entry #7]: TGS Signing Report - Matrimony Cauthon](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=479#7)

#### Matrimony Cauthon

Unfortunately I didn't get to hear many of the questions in the signing line. However, one person did ask a question about Verin's letter to Mat. The person asked if Verin's time-based conditions she stipulated to Mat had something to do with the 'last hour of death' oath that she took.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said that Verin's conditions did have something to do with her oath, but that there was a lot more going on than just that.
