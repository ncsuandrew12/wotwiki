# [Interview #479: TGS Signing Report - Matrimony Cauthon, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=479#2)

#### Question

I am not 100% positive, but I think the person asked if Tam's conversation to Perrin was a plot by RJ and if we would see this come into play later in the series. I think the questioner must have been referring to Tam's comment on whether Perrin truly meant to renounce his claim to Manetheren.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson gave a RAFO to the question. More interestingly he said that this might be something that may not be seen in the rest of the series. I want to see the video feed, but it appears that Perrin's whole kindom building plot-line may not come to a conclusion by the end of the series. I thought I also heard Sanderson mention something about outrigger novels.
