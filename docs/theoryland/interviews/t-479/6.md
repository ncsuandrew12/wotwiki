# [Interview #479: TGS Signing Report - Matrimony Cauthon, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=479#6)

#### Question

Someone asked for clarification about whether we had seen Mesaana and Demandred's alter-egos on screen.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said that we had seen Mesaana's alter-ego on screen as of
*Knife of Dreams*
, but that we had not seen Demandred's alter-ego on screen as of
*Knife of Dreams*
. Sanderson would not elaborate on whether Demandred's alter-ego had been seen in
*The Gathering Storm*
â€”Sanderson didn't want to narrow down the suspects for us if Demandred really had appeared in
*The Gathering Storm*
.
