#### Bravehamster

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also: Siuan going into to a burning building to save Mat was a deliberate reference to her first conversation with him.

#### Footnote

That was not actually her first conversation with him; she met all the boys in Fal Dara, but only Rand's meeting was on screen. The conversation referenced is in
*The Dragon Reborn*
Chapter 20, "Visitations".
