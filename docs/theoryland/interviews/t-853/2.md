#### Brandon Sanderson

There are two Writing Excuses episodes up that I haven't talked about yet. First Maurice Broaddus joined us to talk about
[writing the other](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/09/30/)
â€”writing other cultures, races, genders, etc. Then the latest episode features Dan talking about the
[Seven-Point Story Structure](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/10/07/)
and its use in outlining.
