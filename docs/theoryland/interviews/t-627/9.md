# [Interview #627, Entry #9]: NY ComicCon Report - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=627#9)

#### Ted Herman

Does Elayne know who Rand's father is and that he killed her grandfather Laman?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is not confirmed that Janduin killed Laman.

#### Ted Herman

Do Aviendha or Rand know that Laman was Elayne's grandfather (re: the sword that Aviendha gave to Rand to discharge her
*toh*
)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aviendha probably didn't know but Rand definitely did.

#### Ted Herman

ETAâ€”these topics were to be included in possible prequels.

#### Footnote

The reply is correct that it has not been confirmed that Janduin killed Laman.
However, Laman was
*not*
Elayne's grandfather since Laman died childless [NS5].
