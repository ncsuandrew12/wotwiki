#### Ted Herman

How did Fain know that the ruby dagger was in the White Tower, since last he knew it was in Falme, and now it is thousands of miles away (when he was in Emond's Field)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He has a super detection ability for the dagger, like the Warder Bond, so he can know direction and distance.
