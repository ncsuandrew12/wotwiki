## [Entry #1](./t-956/1)

#### TheOneKEA

I was fortunate to be in line at Brandon's book signing near Baltimore and got to ask him a question.

## [Entry #2](./t-956/2)

#### TheOneKEA

I asked him if it was possible to enter or exit Shadesmar in interplanetary space.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He laughed nervously for several seconds with a look that suggested "Uh-oh!" and replied (as best as I can remember):

I would say no. The Cognitive Realm does exist there, but Shadesmar is a special case.

## [Entry #3](./t-956/3)

#### TheOneKEA

I also referenced the recent Q&A and
[this post](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/2383-qa-with-brandon-sanderson/page__st__60__p__42119#entry42119)
, and speculated that the reason why the original poster thought Wax's sister was a duralumin ferring was because of Wax's comment that he did not feel any strong emotions as a result of her death. I told Brandon that the poster must have thought that she was deliberately suppressing her Connection with Wax by using Feruchemy.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I said that I didn't need a yes or no answer from him, and he replied that he would neither confirm nor deny my statement and would only agree that it was very interesting.
