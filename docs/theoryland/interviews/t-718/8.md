#### Fire Arcadia

Can you tell me something about the Cosmere that you haven't told anyone before?

There are inhabited planets in the cosmere that don't have any Shards there. There may be inhabited planets that only have a Splinter of a Shard. There are 10 core cosmere planets, which tell the overarching story of the cosmere.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

Are all the Cosmere books so far set on these 10 core worlds?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

Are there any of the 10 core worlds without a Shard?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

All 10 core worlds have significant Shardic influence.
