## [Entry #1](./t-555/1)

#### Frenzy

Just got back from the Sacramento booksigning. Here's the fun stuff:

1) 300+ people at the signing. We got there about two hours early, and were 41 & 42 in line.

2) Brandon recognized JWB and I as Theorylanders, and asked if we saw him in his TL shirt.

3) JWB got your book signed, TankSpill.

4) Three people signed my book: Brandon, Harriet, and Jason from Dragonmount. Jason specifically asked for my book, and signed it, "I will never yield the JordanCon stage again!!"

Now, back to the book and many of my theories dying miserable deaths...
