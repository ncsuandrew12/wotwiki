# [Interview #417: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Another Long-Winded Explanation of Various Things, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=417#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

A few quick items.
*Hero of Ages*
has won the
[*Romantic Times*
editor's choice award](http://www.romantictimes.com/books_review.php?book=36495)
. Huzzah! I wasn't certain if I could announce this, but it looks like the magazine has shipped, so I think I can say it now. I'm deeply honored.
*The Romantic Times*
has done a very good job reaching across genre lines and honoring books they think deserve praise, regardless of their genre.

In similar news, I can't remember if I mentioned it or not, but
*Hero*
has also been nominated for the
[David Gemmell Legend Award](http://gemmellaward.com/)
. This is an honor for two reasonsâ€”first, because Mr. Gemmell himself was such a fantastic author. But also because this is a reader-voted award, which means that you all took the time to stop by and give me a nominating vote. That means a lot to me. Thank you so much! I believe that the final winner is also chosen by a vote from readers, so if you feel so inclined, you can
[vote for
*Hero*
to win](http://gemmellaward.ning.com/page/about-your-vote)
. You don't even have to register to do so.

Finally, I have a small stock of copies of the
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
hardcover on hand, and that is getting hard to find in stores, so I thought I'd offer them for sale and personalization. I'll probably do another post on this later, going more in-depth, but if you haven't tried
*Alcatraz*
, this would be the perfect chance.
