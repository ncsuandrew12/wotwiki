**Sequels and standalone novels**

It's rare for a popular fantasy or sf novel to stand alone. Sequels and series follow, and that's a good thing.

A few writers produce brilliant fantasy or sf stories and choose not to write sequels. So, here's my question. For what standalone novel do you most wish the writer would create a sequel?

Here are a few of my picks: 1)
*Neverwhere*
by Neil Gaiman. 2)
*Weaveworld*
by Clive Barker. 3 )
*The Princess Bride*
by William Goldman. 4) Brandon's
*Elantris*
.
