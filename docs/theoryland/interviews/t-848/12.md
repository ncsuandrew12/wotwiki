**YA & illustrated books**

Sometimes I'm jealous of the novels sold into YA. I want them in the Fantasy & SF section. Sure, I understand the publisher's decision, but the books are so good and the appeal so broad that it seems a shame not to show them off all over the store. One example that comes to mind is D. M. Cornish's Monster Blood Tattoo series. Those are some gorgeous books.

Speaking of Monster Blood Tattoo, there are illustrations! Would you like to see more illustrated novels? There are a couple of interesting adult illustrated novels forthcoming:
*Peter & Max*
, a Fables novel & the
*Child Thief*
by Brom. Is this a trend that you'd like to see catch on?
