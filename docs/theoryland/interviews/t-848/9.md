**The Magic & Tech Challenge**

I like the Arthur C. Clarke quote, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

The more advanced the technology in a fantasy setting, the less wondrous magic appears. Technology gives us the power to fly and the capability to communicate across thousands of miles. Not so long ago, both acts would have seemed magical to the average person. The science featured in some of the far-future sf novels appears as strange, wondrous and weird as many magic systems.

This is a big reason why so much fantasy is grounded in the past. I'd love to see more books that approach fantasy and science fiction as one genre, instead of genres in opposition. Is it possible to integrate the two in some way and make it work well? Where are our futuristic fantasies? Can anyone think of great examples?
