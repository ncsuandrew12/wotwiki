#### Robert Jordan

One item I hadnâ€™t heard mentioned before, is that he's "doing lunch" (though he prefers to eat it) with Red Eagle Entertainment tomorrow (11/01/05) in Los Angeles. They've got the outline for
*The Eye of the World*
movie, what they want to keep from the book, what they don't want to use, etc., and he needs to give them an ok on it.
