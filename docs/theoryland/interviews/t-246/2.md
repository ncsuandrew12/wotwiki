# [Interview #246: KOD Signing Report - Darren, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=246#2)

#### Darren

The nice Vroman's clerk gave a quick intro to Mr. Jordan, going over his decorations from the wars he’s been in, his career and other distinctions.

#### Robert Jordan

Mr. Jordan looked a little tired, but was in good spirits when he took to the podium. He acknowledged those of us who read about this sort of thing on the net by asking us to chant along with him when he gave us his caveats of what not to ask—when the next book is out, who killed Asmodean, how long will the next book be, etc. Even for those of us that knew the answers, we were laughing along with him and his dry delivery.
