# [Interview #246: KOD Signing Report - Darren, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=246#3)

#### Robert Jordan

He again confirmed that he's thinking about writing the "outrigger" novels that have been mentioned here before. RJ wants a year or two to poke around the idea to make sure it's a strong idea. Mr. Jordan said it will follow other characters, and some of the characters he's thinking about are major characters from the main novels. However, if after a couple of years the idea isn't seeming as strong as he thinks it is, he won't write them.
