# [Interview #1064: Brandon Sanderson: Heralding a New Era of Fantasy, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1064#3)

#### Frannie Jackson

Sanderson began writing his first book, "a bad knock-off combination of
*Dragonlance*
and
*The Dragonbone Chair*
,‚Äù within the next year. Embarrassed by his efforts, he hid the pages behind a painting in his bedroom so his family wouldn't discover them. This first attempt at writing would become the only manuscript he ever abandoned before it was completed.

Fast-forward several years to college, where Sanderson concocted a grand writing scheme.

"I had heard somewhere, and I can't remember where it was now, that your first five books are generally terrible," Sanderson says. "For me that meant, 'Well, I don't have to be good until book six. So that's okay!' I sat down and decided to write six books."

#### Frannie Jackson

Instead of penning six novels, Sanderson wrote 13 in eight years. He'd taken the graveyard shift as a hotel desk clerk after graduation, allowing him time to write from midnight until 6 a.m. every morning.

"I actually did the starving artist thing, which is awesome to be able to tell people," Sanderson jokes.

#### Frannie Jackson

Rejection letters for eight years of manuscripts piled up, and Sanderson's family became nervous.

"[My mom] kept having my dad call me; she was so worried about me," he says.
