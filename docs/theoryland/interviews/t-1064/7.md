# [Interview #1064: Brandon Sanderson: Heralding a New Era of Fantasy, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1064#7)

In a more transparent vein, Sanderson differs from his fantasy peers in that he has a progress bar on his blog to keep fans updated on the status of his manuscripts.

"When I was getting into reading, I would often get into a big series and have no way of knowing when the next book was coming out or even if the author was working on it," he says. "Having a progress bar on my website lets readers see what I'm working on and that I'm not sitting idle while they wait for books to come out."

#### Frannie Jackson

Sanderson also chose to post
*Warbreaker*
, one of his stand-alone novels, for free on his website in 2007. Many people, including his agent, thought the idea was crazy, but he stood firm.

"Your time is probably more valuable than your money, so I'll give you the money part for free if you'll give me your time," Sanderson explained.

Six years later,
*Warbreaker*
is still available for download on the site, and Sanderson's readership only continues to grow.
