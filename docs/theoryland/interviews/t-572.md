## [Entry #1](./t-572/1)

#### Joe Heron

NY signing.

So I asked a question which may be an oldie during the signing (meaning it wasn't recorded).

So my Q was:

## [Entry #2](./t-572/2)

#### Joe Heron

What happens to the souls of Darkfriends who did good for the Light sides?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### JOE HERON

Not satisfied, I press harder, saying this will be revealed in further reading [skeptical].

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He said there were a lot of things Jim (RJ) wanted fans to keep guessing and wouldn't answer, and this was one of those things about the cosmology that he wanted.

#### JOE HERON

Then I asked Maria (yes I was sneaky), and her answer made her sound kind of unsure how to answer it, but then she finally said:

#### MARIA SIMONS

Well he is called the Lord of the Grave, so...

#### JOE HERON

So seems like Ingtar and Verin really paid a huge price to help the Light-siders. Again, not sure if this was asked but I thought it interesting....and who knows, they may change it since its not finished yet.
