## [Entry #1](./t-489/1)

#### Question

Moiraine words the Third Oath, "I vow that I will never use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defending my life or that of my Warder or another sister." (
*New Spring*
11) This ...wording of the Oath is supported by the reswearing of the Oaths by Pevara and Seaine (
*The Path of Daggers*
26), and the BWB (24), among other sources.

Egwene words the Oath, "I vow that I will never use the One Power as a weapon except against Darkfriends and Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defending my life or that of my Warder or of another sister." (
*The Gathering Storm*
43) The 'Darkfriend clause' is supported by Sheriam (
*The Great Hunt*
23), Alanna (
*The Shadow Rising*
31), Niall (
*The Dragon Reborn*
Prologue), Rand (
*The Fires of Heaven*
2, 41), and also implications by Moiraine (
*New Srping*
2) and the BWB (14).

RAFO, or error? And, if error, which is the correct wording?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said he had to make sure he got the wording right for the oaths, so he went back and copied it word for word from the previous books. Maria was the one that changed it, saying RJ decided that Darkfriends should have always been included in the oaths.
