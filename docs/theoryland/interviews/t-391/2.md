# [Interview #391: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Happy Koloss Head-Munching Day!, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=391#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

A few things to point out. First off, we are at 99% (!) on
*A Memory of Light*
as of last night. We'll see if I can get some more writing done tomorrow and bring us up to the 400k mark. However, THIS IS NOT THE END. We will soon see what happens in the system when I type in 101%. I'm honestly not sure how the code will regard that.

I'm expecting to go to 150% or so on this book, maybe 175%. It won't go to 800k, I don't think, but 600-700 seems likely. I might just keep the same progress bar and have it inch higher, since if you're following the blog, you know what that means. And if someone sees the bar for the first time, there's a chance they'll interpret it right if it shows 110% or so. Once I'm into revisions, I'll have a separate progress bar for those.
