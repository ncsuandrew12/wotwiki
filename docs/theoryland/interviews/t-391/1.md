# [Interview #391: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Happy Koloss Head-Munching Day!, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=391#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you all for the birthday wishes; I had a flood of emails and Facebook posts, and they are appreciated greatly. It has been a great day so far. (Spent the afternoon playing Magic with a group of friends, and am watching a movie tonight with Pemberly after eating a nice big bowl of Mac and Cheese.)

even gave me four packs of cards as a gift, and I got a foil rare, so life is great. ;)
