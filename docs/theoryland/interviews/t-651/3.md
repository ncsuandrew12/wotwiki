# [Interview #651: Archon Report - Westeros, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=651#3)

#### Reporter

Other than that, it was about Jordan. Not even mostly about his series. Just himself.

#### Robert Jordan

The highlight is that he served in the Vietnam war and he was, apparently, quite an efficient soldier. It did a job on his psyche, it seems. One thing he mentioned was that there was a picture that his friend took of him, where he was sitting on a log eating his ration, with 3 or 4 dead bodies around him. One of them was a guy with half his brain blown off by a grenade or something. Quite gruesome.

#### Footnote

RJ told this story
[on his blog](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=302)
in 2007.
