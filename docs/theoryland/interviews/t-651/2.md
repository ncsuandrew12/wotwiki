# [Interview #651: Archon Report - Westeros, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=651#2)

#### Reporter

Okay, so the interview went on. The interview was about Jordan. I mean, it was all him. Very little Martin. So I don't think I'll repeat the majority of it.

#### Robert Jordan

The pertinent part is that Jordan said he had planned the WoT series to be 5 books (I did a good job not to scoff), but the story has its own mind and can't be contained (again, I didn't laugh). Martin said that he had the same problem. He had originally planned that
*Game of Thrones*
and
*Clash of Kings*
to be one book.
