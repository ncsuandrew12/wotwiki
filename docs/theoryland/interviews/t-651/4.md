#### Robert Jordan

At the end, Jordan said there's a poll on Motley Fool (not sure if he's making it up or not) asking:

Which event will take place first?

1. Robert Jordan finishes WoT series
  
2. GRRM finishes
*Song of Ice and Fire*
series
  
3. Obscure reference I didn't catch
  
4. Heat death of the universe

and the poll has #4 leading 5:1 to all other choices.
