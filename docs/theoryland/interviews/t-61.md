## [Entry #1](./t-61/1)

#### Bo Lindbergh

Just some things I thought I'd pass on from the Robert Jordan interview an hour ago at the convention (East of the Sun) currently going on here in Stockholm.... (More stuff coming later tonight!)

## [Entry #2](./t-61/2)

#### Robert Jordan

About being shy: RJ claimed that he's been voted the most retiring man in the world for six years running. Has he been reading signatures from this newsgroup?

## [Entry #3](./t-61/3)

#### Robert Jordan

About the FAQ: he gave some actual numbers: 30-40% dead on, 30-40% not quite but in the right direction, the rest way off. No hints about which is which, though. :-) Also, he seems to have gotten the usual impression that the answers are final and the questions must never be brought up again.

## [Entry #4](./t-61/4)

#### Robert Jordan

More material for the "how old is everyone" section: Faile was 17 when she met Perrin.
