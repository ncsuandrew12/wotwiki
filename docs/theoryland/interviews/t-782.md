## [Entry #1](./t-782/1)

#### Laurel4Amyrlin

I asked Brandon about Mesaana, and if we'd seen her Aes Sedai alter ego on stage yet.

#### Brandon Sanderson

His answer was two-part: per RJ, we hadn't seen her on stage prior to
*Knife of Dreams*
, but he wouldn't confirm or deny her appearance since thenâ€”that was RAFO-ed.

He did, however, tell me that she WAS still in the White Tower at the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### Laurel4Amyrlin

SO. There's a little tidbit of info for you to chew on. I want to hear some theories! :)
