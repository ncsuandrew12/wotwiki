## [Entry #1](./t-788/1)

#### Linda

Will Perrin undergo major new character development in
*Towers of Midnight*
as did, say, Fortuona and Rand in
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said he wouldn't answer specifically; I said I only wanted a general indication and he said that at the end of his scene in
*The Gathering Storm*
Perrin was about ready for character development. So I took that as a yes.
