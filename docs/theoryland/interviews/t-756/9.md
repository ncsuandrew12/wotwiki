# [Interview #756: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=756#9)

#### Question

There was a question about when Michael Whelan's cover art for
*A Memory of Light*
would be completed and released.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet indicated that the Whelan cover art is actually done and originally was going to be revealed at JordanCon. (Whelan was tapped to do the cover of the ebook of
*A Memory of Light*
before Darrell K. Sweet passed away.) However, because Darrell K. Sweet, Jr., was kind enough to bring to JordanCon several of his father's original paintings for the cover art of the previous books, as well as the preliminary version of Sweet's
*A Memory of Light*
cover, it was decided to celebrate the work of Darrell K. Sweet at JordanCon and to wait for a while before the Whelan cover art is revealed.

It was also mentioned that Whelan initially sent a number of versions of the cover art to Team Jordan and Tor for review before he produced the final version for
*A Memory of Light*
. The scene depicted is a different one than that shown in Darrell K. Sweet's preliminary artwork. Also, at one point it was mentioned that Whelan sent out a query to someone asking, "What's a
*ter'angreal*
?"
