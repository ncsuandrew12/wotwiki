#### Question

The final question of the session went to Tamyrlin.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

For some reason he always seems to have Asmodean on the brain, lol, so he asked whether or not the glossary of
*A Memory of Light*
would contain any important information. Harriet teased that now she would make it a point to include something important in the glossary of
*A Memory of Light*
!
