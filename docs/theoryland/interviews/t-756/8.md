# [Interview #756, Entry #8]: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=756#8)

#### Melissa Craib

Melissa Craib, this year's JordanCon master of ceremonies, asked the Team Jordan members which parts of the story they had been surprised about.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet told about an
[incident she has described before](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#12)
from when she was writing the blurb for the dust jacket of
*The Dragon Reborn*
and finally realized that RJ intended
*Callandor*
to be an analog of the sword in the stone. She yelled down to RJ, "You son of a \*\*\*\*, you've done it to me again!"

#### Maria Simons

Maria said that she was surprised... well, actually I've forgotten what Maria was surprised about. Maybe somebody else remembers...was it from
*Knife of Dreams*
when Semirhage blows Rand's hand off? That's what comes to mind, but I don't remember any details about why that surprised her, really, so maybe that's not it. :s

#### Alan Romanczuk

Alan at first said that he wasn't surprised by anything; he had figured it all out, of course. Then he owned up to being a little surprised about the scene in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
in which Perrin chops off the hand of one of the captured Shaido, because it showed the depths to which a person could go when pushed to the brink.

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Peter said he was surprised when it was revealed that Demandred was... (yeah, he was messing with us).

Nalesean at Theoryland
