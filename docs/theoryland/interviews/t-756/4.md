# [Interview #756, Entry #4]: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=756#4)

#### Question

Will the prequels or outriggers be written?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet answered no.

#### [Footnote - Terez](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=186882#poststop)

To be clear, the question was were there any plans to do the outriggers/prequels, and she said no, there are no plans. She still hasn't given a straight answer; I paid very close attention to the wording.
