# [Interview #346: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: NAME OF THE WIND Paperback out! + New Spring, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=346#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Just in case you've been living under the proverbial rock this year and haven't heard about Patrick Rothfuss, you should know that his fantastic first novel—
*The Name of the Wind*
—is now out in paperback. (As of Monday, I believe.) Book two is due out next week. The first book is great, and I suspect the second one will be too. And he didn't even pay me to write that or anything!

I'll actually be picking up one of the paperbacks here soon myself, since my hardcover got lost on book tour last year. (I'd brought it on the tour for David Farland to read, and somehow one of us ended up leaving the book behind. So, if you work at a Best Western on the west coast and somebody left their hardcover of
*The Name of the Wind*
in a hotel room, you know who to send it to!)
