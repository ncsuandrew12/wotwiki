# [Interview #477: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Hitting the West Coast, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=477#2)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

This week's
[Writing Excuses podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/11/15/)
covers the business of writing comics, again with Jake Black filling in for Brandon (whose we-don't-ever-discuss-it stint writing the webcomic "American Bachelors with Mecha(s)" is not nearly as relevant as Jake Black's professional experience in the industry).

In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations, Brandon talks about
[Preservation's power](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/304/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Thirty-Eight)
and
[the working mechanism of Hemalurgy](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/305/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Thirty-Nine)
. He specifically does not say anything about Adonalsium. Writers can be so cruel.
