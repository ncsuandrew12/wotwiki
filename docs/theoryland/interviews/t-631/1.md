# [Interview #631: Audio Renaissance Interview, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=631#1)

#### Marie Curie

This is a transcript of an interview with RJ by Audio Renaissance. It has been included at the end of several of the audiobooks (books 1-5 and 11). It appears that the interview must have been recorded when the Wheel of Time was first released on audiobook, which was (as far as I can tell) around 1997.
