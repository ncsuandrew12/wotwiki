Does Nicola’s Foretelling represent a single moment in time?

Which one is she talking about?

#### QUESTION

Three on the boat, and he who is dead yet lives. The great battle done, but the world not done with battle. The land divided by the return, and the guardians balance the servants. The future teeters on the edge of a blade

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

MAFO. I’m gonna MAFO that one. I think I know that one, but I don’t think I want to touch it.
