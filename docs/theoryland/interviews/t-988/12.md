# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#12)

#### Question

So, are you planning on doing anything else with Elantris or Warbreaker universes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am. I don’t know if you read Emperor’s Soul but it’s in the Elantris universe. It’s set on a different continent, so you have to keep your eyes open to see the connections but the magic systems are working on the same fundamental formula. You will enjoy that one if you liked Elantris and Warbreaker I will get back to eventually.
