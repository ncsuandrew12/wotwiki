# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#7)

#### Question

Just wanted to ask how you come up with all your different universes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, it’s hard to say where specifically where they come from. You can point to certain ones and say, Mistborn, Mistborn came from me driving through a fog bank at 80 miles an hour and saying, “Wow that looks cool, can I use that?” And you can point at Warbreaker with me saying, “I’ve done this whole world of ash and I need to do something colorful, let’s build a color based magic system.” Way of Kings is definitely influenced by tidal pools and things like that. And so, each one’s different, it’s just things I see that I think will make interesting stories and settings.
