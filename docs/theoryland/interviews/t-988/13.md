# [Interview #988, Entry #13]: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#13)

#### Question

Oh, my question was does Perrin lose a body part in the book, since Mat has lost one, Rand has lost one, does Perrin lose one next?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Perrin’s body part was the knee, where he got shot through the leg with the arrow. Because the mythological symbolism is with Mat- it’s the Odin mythology, and Odin lost an eye. Perrin is actually the blacksmith mythology, which if you’ve read in Hephaestus and Perun and of the various blacksmiths, they usually have a bad leg. I wasn’t going to chop off his leg. I had that wound, and he kind of feels a phantom wound, if you’ll read in the last book there are several times where his leg aches even though he was healed. That’s the symbolism there.

#### QUESTION

So, did you just decide to [inaudible] or was that..?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No, Robert Jordan had done that, that was him.

#### QUESTION

I wasn’t sure if I was just coming up with a fantasy or not.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Though I knew he had to be wounded in the leg, I didn’t know how or how badly so I kind of came up with how it happened.
