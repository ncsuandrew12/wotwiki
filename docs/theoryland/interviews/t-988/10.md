# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#10)

#### Question

So I was reading the Alloy of Law, and at the end I read through the Ars Arcanum. And I got confused because it’s written in first person, but it refers to Harmony in third person. I thought he was writing it, so who writes that part?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a good question for you to be asking, one which people have been curious about, and I have not yet answered who writes all of the Ars Arcanum, but they are in-world, somebody's writing them. If you ever read The Way of Kings, it’s written in first-person too.

#### QUESTION

Are they all written by the same person?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Ah, have I answered that yet?

#### JOSH

You should.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I should? They are all written by the same person.

#### QUESTION

Because it sounds like they’re written by Hoid, I think.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

They are all written by the same person.
