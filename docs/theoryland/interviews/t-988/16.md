#### Question

Brandon, have we seen a point of view chapter from the character who writes the Ars Arcanum?

I’m not gonna tell you that. That would be way too much giving away.

#### QUESTION

Is the character who writes the Ars Arcanum from Sel originally?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I’m not gonna tell you anything about the character who writes the Ars Arcanum.
