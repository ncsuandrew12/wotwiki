# [Interview #988, Entry #4]: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#4)

#### Question

What time period do they all fit in, do they all fit in time- at the same time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, like for instance, Way of Kings and Alloy of Law are pretty close to one another but Elantris is fairly far before them. So far I’ve written them chronologically basically, except I’ve skipped certain stories, like there’s a series called White Sand which is in the middle there somewhere which will actually be a jump back in time when I end up doing it and some things like that. And Dragonsteel is like way at the beginning which I’ll eventually do but I’ve done them chronologically so far.
