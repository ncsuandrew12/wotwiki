#### Mi'ch

Was the Reod natural?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Reod natural? [Laughs]

#### MI'CH

Here’s the thing, you’ve answered this question for us already, we just need it on audio.

#### JOSH

It wasn’t the Reod that was the question it was was the earthquake natural?

#### MI'CH

No, Eric’s asking if the Reod was natural.

#### JOSH

To heck with Eric, we don’t care about him.

#### MI'CH

You’ve told us that the earthquake was not caused by natural events.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, it’s a complicated question because the earthquake was not caused by natural but the Reod was a natural effect of the earthquake, then... does that make sense? So the Reod is natural, a natural result of... does that make sense? That’s why it was a tricky question.

#### QUESTION

But the earthquake was not natural.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No, it was not.

#### AARON

So the Reod is a natural reaction to an unnatural occurrence.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes.

#### JOSH

And wasn’t it because there was like magical strain on the land?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That is certainly part of what was going on.
