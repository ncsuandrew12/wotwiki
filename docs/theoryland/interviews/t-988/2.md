#### Question

With the Wheel of Time, whoâ€™s your favorite character to read about, and then your favorite one to write about?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My favorite one to read- during the early parts of the series it was Perrin and during the later parts of the series it was Mat. And my favorite one to write was probably Perrin because- historically, like when I was a young guy reading the books, he was my favorite, he was the one I identified with.
