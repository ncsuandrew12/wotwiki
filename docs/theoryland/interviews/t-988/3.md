# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#3)

#### Question

I enjoy Way of Kings, it seems like that’s the one where everyone’s coming together. I was reading online about Galladon and Demoux being in it. I enjoyed that. Is that going to happen more often?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In that book- that series, yes. There will be more crossover. It’s kinda one of the core stories, along with the things happening on the Mistborn world and things like that. And so, there’s going to be a lot more crossover. Most of it’s still kind of subtle stuff, but if you keep your eyes open there’ll be some real zingers in the next two books.
