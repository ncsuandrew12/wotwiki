# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#22)

#### Question

Do you have any more Legion? Is there anywhere to find it or is a limited print run?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah, Legion had a limited print run, but we are in discussions that- enough people are asking that that I think we’re going to do a paperback that’ll come out. So, eventually we should be releasing a little paperback of that that you can get. At the very least you should be able to get it on my website eventually. This is the first time I’d done something that small and we didn’t know about the limited edition and things so we just wanted to do- we were very cautious about it and it sold out very quickly. So hopefully we’ll be able to do some more.
