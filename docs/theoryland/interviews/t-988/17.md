# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#17)

#### Question

Is the city that the Parshendi are in Urithiru?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the Way of Kings, Jasnah tells Shallan that Urithiru is not on the Shattered Plains. So either Jasnah is incorrect or that is not Urithiru.

#### QUESTION

In other words, you’re not going to tell me?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I’m just clarifying for you so that you have all the information you need in order to make judgements and ask questions.

#### Footnote

Brandon pronounced Urithiru like "You-rith-ir-oo".
