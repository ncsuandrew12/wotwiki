# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#9)

#### Question

And so like the Windrunners, they’re just one Order of the Knights Radiant, aren’t they?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes they are, in fact they are- every order is a grouping of one of these [points to the large symbols on the Radiant tables] and two of these [points at the smaller symbols], these are the Surges. So these are the ten, sort of forces. And so Windrunning is pressure and gravitation, which are those two. But the Skybreakers are right there [points to gold symbol in the upper middle], with a different combination and each of these different groupings would make one order of the Knights Radiant. And that is the symbol of the Windrunners, right there on the cover. [Points at the swordgylph under the dust jacket]. So, fun little easter-egg type things there.
