# [Interview #988: West Jordan Signing Report - Josh & Mi'ch, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=988#14)

#### Brandon's Dad

Brandon started reading Robert Jordan when he was nine and ten, and he used to get under the covers with a candle. And his mother liked to stay up, he’s a night owl, so his mother would stay up til one or two in the morning. And so then he’d blow the candle out before she’d come up. So what I did was I got him a flashlight so he could read better, but I got him a great big one like this. [guestures] So she’d holler up and say, “Are you still up there Brandon,” and he’d say, “No!”. So, when he was little he was reading these books, Robert Jordan’s books, he read every single one. I’d take him down and he’d play pinball or go over and write books. And then when he got into junior high it was cards, Dungeons and Dragons, that kind of stuff. So that’s a true story you can put that on your website. Almost burned the house down a couple of times.
