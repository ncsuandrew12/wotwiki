#### Jaller

I asked Brandon whether kandra could replicate parshendi carapace

they couldn't.

#### Jaller

whether or not it was to do with the same thing as hair and if that was the reason why,

sort of, yes.

## [Entry #2](./t-1141/2)

#### Jaller

I also asked Brandon about that part in the Wandersail chapter of WoK, where Syl leaves Kaladin before he meets Hoid because she gets a bad feeling. I wanted to know whether this related to why Vin decided to not meet Hoid in HoA.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that they both got a certain impression from him, but wouldn't say whether or not it was the same thing, and stated I would have to RAFO what that was exactly.

## [Entry #3](./t-1141/3)

#### Jaller

The last question I asked was if anyone had tried to include allomantic metals in cooking.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that other than Wax putting steel in whisky, he didn't think so.
