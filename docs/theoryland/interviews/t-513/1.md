Here's a story that, for some reason, I don't think I ever told on LJ or the newsgroup. I'm not sure why, but no matter. I'll tell it now.

A few years ago, I got an email from Jason Denzel, whom some of you may know runs
[Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com)
, one of the largest Wheel of Time fan sites on the Internet, if not the biggest. Jason told me that he and a few friends were going up to Oakland, CA in November to meet up with one James Oliver Rigney, Jr. and his wife Harriet for dinner and a VIP tour of Pixar animation studios, and did I want to come along?

Well, now
*there's*
a stupid question.

My sister Liz and I, accordingly, rented a car that weekend and drove up to the Bay Area. The rental company gave us this ridiculously purple PT Cruiser which was about the last car I would ever have
*owned*
, but as a weekend rental was hilariously awesome. It was so, so very purple. Not only that, but Liz and I showed up at the rental place separately, and realized we were both wearingâ€”purple. when the rental car lady handed me our rental agreement in a purple folder, it was over. The trip became The Great Purple California Trip of 2004.

The trip up was relaxing and uneventful, the only shame being that we didn't have enough purple music for our purple trip. (No Deep Purple.) We did, however, stop and buy some purple wine, so
*that*
was all right.

We arrived at our hotel in Oakland, which was sadly lacking in purple decor, but consoled ourselves that the bedspreads in our room were
*kind of*
deep red-purplish. If you squinted.
