# [Interview #513: Meeting Robert Jordan - Leigh Butler, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=513#3)

#### Leigh Butler

The tour was fun and interesting. As an owner of pretty much every Pixar movie on DVD, much of it was stuff I had heard before on commentaries or extras, but it was still cool to see it all in person. My favorite bit was the life-size stuffed Sully (from
*Monsters, Inc.*
) in the foyer. He was very huggable.

We mostly stuck to Pixar/animation topics, but at one point we strayed into a discussion of our favorite Wheel of Time characters. Mr. Rigney seemed bemused to hear me state that I had loathed Mat for the first three books, up until his fight with Galad and Gawyn in the Tower, and that afterward he became my favorite character in the series.
