# [Interview #513: Meeting Robert Jordan - Leigh Butler, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=513#2)

#### Leigh Butler

The next day we drove to Pixar, and met Jason and his wife and a couple other friends of his, including the lovely \_\_\_\_\_, who was giving us this private tour of the studio. Jason, I'm pleased to report, is a Nice Guy (and not in the bad way, either!), and we got along well from the get-go.

Soon after that, Mr. and Mrs. Rigney arrived. Mr. Rigney walked slowly, with a cane, but seemed lively and genuinely pleased to see the studio. Mrs. Rigney was just adorable. Hopefully the big grin I had on my face when introduced to the couple was put down to fannish delight, and not what it actually wasâ€”sartorial glee.

Guess what color Mr. Rigney was wearing?

So, so perfect.
