# [Interview #738, Entry #1]: Letter to Leslie Annis](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=738#1)

#### Robert Jordan

Dear Leslie,

Thank you for your letter. I am glad you like The Wheel of Time, and hope that you will enjoy the future volumes, too. I am currently at work on book eight, which does not yet have a title, and I am scheduled to deliver it to my publisher in the fall of 1997. Both my editor and my publisher feel that I have been working much too hard over the past ten years—especially the last six—and that I need to slow down if I am not to fall over.

Thanks again for writing.

With best wishes,

I am,

Sincerely,

Robert Jordan
