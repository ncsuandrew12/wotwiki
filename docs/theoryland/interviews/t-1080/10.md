#### [QuestionÂ ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/7267-words-of-brandon-compiled-x-2/)

What caused a Desolation to end? Was it just the defeat of Odium's forces? Because the Desolations start when the Heralds break under torture.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because the Heralds can no longer be in existence. There is a certain period of time that they can be there, and after that, if they're there, they will start a new one. So the Heralds do need to leave for a Desolation to end.

#### Question

Oh. So they've got a time limit.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They do. Otherwise the Desolation will start again. What they discovered is not all of them have to. As long as one remains, the Desolation will not start again.

#### Question

So, by the nine leaving, did that actually break the Oathpact for them? Did it change the cycle of Desolations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have not completely broken the Oathpact, despite what they may think.
