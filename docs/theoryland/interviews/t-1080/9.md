#### [QuestionÂ ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/7267-words-of-brandon-compiled-x-2/)

Did Taravangian go to see the Nightwatcher before or after Gavilar's assassination?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, oh man. I'm going to have to look at my timeline. I believe it's before, but I can't guarantee I'm right, because these things are all happening around the same time.

#### Question

Because he says that Gavilar confided in him the night of.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooooh, you're right. Nope, it's after. It is after. You can send that question to Peter so we can confirm it. There might be something I'm forgetting about Taravangian.

[Peter said by PM: "As far as I can tell from what the book says, he went to the Nightwatcher after the assassination."]
