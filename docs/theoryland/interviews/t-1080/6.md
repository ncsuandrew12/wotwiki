#### darkanimereal1 (Paraphrased)

So, the Purelake in Shadesmar is mountainous. Does this in any way have to do with the fact that the Purelake is so shallow?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

I haven't yet discussed the nature of the relationship between Shadesmar and the Physical world.

#### darkanimereal1 (Paraphrased)

So, when Dalinar has his vision in what he assumes in the Purelake, he sees an obsidian fortress. Is that fortress in any way related to the fact that the Purelake in Shadesmar is mountainous?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.
