#### Question

I was wondering if any of the characters from interludes will end up with their own books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, they will. Lift, specifically, is one of the characters in the back five. I think she might be the only one who has had a view point so far. That’s, um, no... There are others. So, yes, interlude characters will end up with their own books later on. Right now they’re side characters.
