#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

A few fun tidbits: Brandon assumes that eventually they'll make a collective art book of all of the Stormlight art. In addition, in the picture of Adolin, the double underlined sigh was "his addition." Also, this may already have been known, but for sure each of the ten books will be named after in-world books. Because of this, " The Stormlight Archive" is a play on words (literally an archive of books).
