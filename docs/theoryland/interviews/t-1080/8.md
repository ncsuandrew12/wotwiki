#### [QuestionÂ ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/7267-words-of-brandon-compiled-x-2/)

The weepings--Shallan and Kaladin react very differently to them.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They do.

#### Question

It just seems to me that the Weepings feel very close to Cultivation.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The primary thing you're noticing -- and I'm not going to say there's not any magical influence -- but the primary thing you're noticing is that Kaladin has season affective disorder and Shallan likes the rain. That's the primary thing you're noticing. I like the rain--my wife hates it. My wife gets depressed when it rains and I love when it rains.

#### Footnote

changed "defective" to "affective"
