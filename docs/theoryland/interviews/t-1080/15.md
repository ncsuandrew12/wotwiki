#### [QuestionÂ ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/7267-words-of-brandon-compiled-x-2/)

How many parties were there to the original Oathpact?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Heralds and Honor. They thought that by walking away from their oaths, that it would break the Oathpact. They're going to find out that it's not quite as broken as they had previously thought (meaning the Heralds).
