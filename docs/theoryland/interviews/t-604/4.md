Did Aginor have anything to do with creating the Nym?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not that I know of. I can MAFO that, but I'm like 95% sure on that.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The Green Man? No...he was good!

#### Terez

You know, that's what I said to him last night, and then he was like, 'Well, you know, before the Bore was drilled, you know...that might have been what he was doing.' Because, you know, he had to get his experience in bioengineering somewhere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah...

#### blindillusion

Yeah, where did he get his start?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a good question, but I don't think so. I really don't. But, if you really want me to go to the notes and search it out, I will.

#### blindillusion

That works for me. Thank you very much.

#### Maria Simons

A quick search turned up nothing, I'm afraid. I'll try to remember to keep my eyes open for it.
