#### Scott

In
*Towers of Midnight*
, when Rand confronts Lord Weiramon and Lady Anaiyella, and they basically can't look at him...I was wondering, does he have like an aura of Lightness that's preventing them from looking at him, or was it possibly that Verin clued him in to the fact that they were Darkfriends in her letter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More will be revealed...

#### Scott

We'll get some more info on that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll get some more info on things that were happening in
*Towers of Midnight*
once you see from Rand's perspective in the next book.

#### Scott

Great! That's great to hear...I can't wait for it. Thank you.
