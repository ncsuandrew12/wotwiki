You even put the yeard in! That's awesome.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I didn't put the yeard in...

#### Terez

Yeah you did!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I put the yeard in, but I didn't call him 'yeard', though...I called him 'Zod', which is my nickname for him, because he reminds me of General Zod in all his publicity photos, so there you are.

#### Terez

[He moves on to signing
[my copy](http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i111/Terez27/HeroofAges.png)
of
*Hero of Ages*
, and a dude behind me joins the conversation.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

You voted for Quick Ben, didn't you?

#### Terez

In the last round.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, uh-huh.

#### Terez

Up until the semi-finals, I supported Vin, but in the finals I supported Quick Ben.

#### Dude

I never even heard of that series until the, uh...

#### Terez

Well that's what cage match is for!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And it's actually a shame; he should be better known than he is. He's a really great writer.

#### Terez

It's the learning curve.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's the learning curve mixed with some really bad publication luck. What was going on with him is, he published first in the UK, and got a really good big following, and then he did a big launch in America with TOR, but by then, all the Americans had heard about him from the UK and were buying the UK editions, and TOR was behind, and so every time they would publish a UK edition, all his fans went and bought the UK edition, and then TOR would release several months later, and it wouldn't sell...

#### Terez

Because we wanted our books to match!

#### Brandon Sanderson

...and so he had real trouble getting shelf presence in America for that reason.

#### Dude

Yeah, that makes sense.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And it is a shame; he's a really good author. But I think he's catching up finally. TOR is simultaneously releasing now, which will really help.

#### Dude

I definitely want to start picking up new series once the Wheel of Time is done. I've invested in too many large series that are ongoing...

#### Terez

And this one is finished!

#### Brandon Sanderson

This one is finished. He's going to do more in the world, but the series is done, so you can read it full sequence. It's very nice.

#### Dude

Thank you.
