# [Interview #604, Entry #5]: JordanCon 2011 - Terez](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=604#5)

#### Marie Curie

Even a stone in a wall has a thread in the Pattern, right? You said so...

#### Brandon Sanderson

As I understand it, Robert Jordan specifically said that even inanimate objects have a thread.

#### Marie Curie

So, that explains why when, say, a stone pillar is balefired, only the portion that balefire hits disintegrates...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right...

#### Marie Curie

...because all of those little bits would have their own threads...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Theoretically. And I was wrong on that for a while—I had to go back and look at interviews before I...[to Terez] Were you the one that sent me that?

#### Terez

Yeah, I

that to you...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah...the boat that Nynaeve was on that got balefired...

#### Marie Curie

She pointed out that inanimate objects...their threads are burned back. But that also explains why a person who has one thread tied to their soul would be completely eliminated by balefire.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmmhmm.

#### Marie Curie

So...why did their clothes go away?

#### Terez

(laughs)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Balefire does spread a bit, from what I've read.

#### Marie Curie

Then why doesn't it for the column?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does, but it's like, you know...just a little bit.

#### Marie Curie

Right, but if you use a pencil-thin bit of balefire, right, and I shot your shirt, why would the whole shirt disappear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, if it goes through and hits you, then you disintegrate, and it will spread out from you.

#### Marie Curie

Then, that doesn't explain Nynaeve's boat.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it doesn't. ... I will be perfectly honest with you. I've worked through and tried to figure out the rules of balefiring inanimate objects quite a bit...because we've got the whole thing with Nynaeve and...

#### Marie Curie

The rowers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Well no, not even that...earlier than that with the balefire rod that's like cutting swaths through the palace in Tanchico, and it's just cutting lines through the palace, just slicing big holes...

#### Marie Curie

Right. That's the stone pillars...the multiple threads...

#### Terez

It did the same thing in Caemlyn with Rand and Rahvin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And that's searing little lines, but then you hit something living, and it all \*poofs\*. It actually becomes motes...like it hits and it spreads to the full, living thing, and then \*poof\* that all goes away. And so...the clothes are something I hadn't even thought of, but balefire does seem to spread a little bit...

#### Marie Curie

You would think that, you know...where the balefire hit, obviously there would be a hole, the person would \*poof\*, and their clothes would drop.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. But it's got to spread a little bit because of that. But then, you know, with the boat...yeah.

#### Marie Curie

You can't imagine how many debates we've had on Theoryland about the boat...

#### Terez

Oh god...

#### Brandon Sanderson

The boat is an outlier. You could argue a couple of things on it—distance and power level could both be involved.

#### Marie Curie

And there are other outliers, like in
*The Gathering Storm*
...um...

#### Terez

The palace?

#### Marie Curie

Yeah, the palace...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That, I did intentionally. Looking through everything that is happening, and saying, 'He is continuing to pump balefire into this thing, to expand it through into the entire thing...'

#### Terez

So, it's a deliberate, directive thing...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's got to be possible, because in the Age of Legends...

#### Terez

Right, whole cities...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, whole cities. And so there's got to be a force-to-spread multiplier. Does that make sense?

#### Marie Curie

Sure.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, I'm using a force-to-spread multiplier. And so you could maybe make that argument with the boat.
