#### Question

Do individuals with Talents not directly related to channeling such as Sniffing, Wolfsiblings or Dreaming need trainers to help them discover that they have these Talents?

#### Alan Romanczuk

No, the people will still be able to use their Talents eventually, but not at as refined a level as if they had been trained.
