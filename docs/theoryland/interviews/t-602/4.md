# [Interview #602: JordanCon Report - Ted Herman, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=602#4)

#### Question

Did the Eelfinn know Mat would be returning when they gave him the
*ashandarei*
and told him "Wise to take leavetaking, etc..."?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They don't have perfect knowledge of the future (think Dreamers) but they knew it was a possibility. Also, they gave him the
*ashandarei*
in fulfillment of his request for leavetaking, but were hoping he would not realize that, and be trapped in their domain.
