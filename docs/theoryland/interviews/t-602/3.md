#### Question

How about Padan Fain and his talents?

#### Alan Romanczuk

He acquired his talents when he merged with Mordeth, who [paraphrased a bit] got his from research and sucked the souls from his victims.

#### Question

Was Padan Fain behind the killer fog in the Rahad?

#### Alan Romanczuk

What do you think? LOL

#### Footnote

We don't have any particular reason to think Fain was in Ebou Dar at that time.
