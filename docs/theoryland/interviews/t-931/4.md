# [Interview #931: AMOL Signing Report - Ways, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=931#4)

#### Ways

Wifey and I elected not to stay for the customization period after the routine signing since we were tired and the crowd was huge. Hope to catch up with him at the Con for this. Instead we grabbed some snacks at the Whole Foods next door and headed back to the room to rest up for the journey to Maker's Mark and home the next day.

Photos snapped during my minute at the signing table follow (well-executed by Mrs. Ways, signing line not

held up).
