# [Interview #931: AMOL Signing Report - Ways, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=931#3)

#### Ways

I struggled with what question to ask Brandon during my 30 seconds with him while he signed. The best I came up with was: "Will you be putting in an appearance at Jordan-Con this year?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Didn't think this question had been answered)â€”to which he answered "Yes", then asked me if Freelancer would be coming when he learned I followed Leigh's reread.

#### Ways

Free is already aware of this and, I gather, feels quite honored. Perhaps Brandon convinced our compatriot to attend the Con during the SD signing, but I'm not holding my breath (just hopeful).
