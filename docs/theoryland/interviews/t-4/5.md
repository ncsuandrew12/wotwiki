# [Interview #4, Entry #5]: TOR Questions of the Week Part I](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#5)

#### Week 5 Question

How much do you expect your work on the prequels will delay the completion of the regular Wheel of Time series?

#### Robert Jordan

Very little, I hope. The prequels are all to be much smaller books and considerably less complex than the main sequence titles, so I expect to finish each of them relatively quickly.
