# [Interview #4: TOR Questions of the Week Part I, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#16)

#### Week 16 Question

Can you give us any updates on the next book series you plan to write? (Besides what you have told us before.)

#### Robert Jordan

Sorry, that is very much a work in progress, with nothing at all on paper yet. As such, details change frequently. Also, the more I tell you of what doesn't change, the fewer surprises there will be when the books come out. You'll start reading and say, "I knew that. And I knew that. And I knew THAT! God, Jordan is getting predictable in his old age. I think I'll go read somebody else." And you'll probably be upset about what did change, too, for that matter. I know that when I expect a book or movie to be a certain way and it isn't, quite often the shifting of gears detracts from my enjoyment until it is complete.
