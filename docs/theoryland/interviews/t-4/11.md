# [Interview #4: TOR Questions of the Week Part I, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#11)

#### Week 11 Question

I just started
*The Great Hunt*
and I find the religious and political aspects very interesting. I notice the dedication for
*The Great Hunt*
says, "They came to my aid when God walked across the water, and the true Eye of the World passed over my house." Has your own religion in any way helped to shape the book?

#### Robert Jordan

Only in the sense that it helped to shape my moral and ethical beliefs. My work certainly is not religious in even the sense that J.R.R. Tolkien's was, much less the work of C.S. Lewis. That inscription, by the way, referred to Hurricane Hugo striking Charleston, where I live. The word hurricane comes from the name of a god of the Caribe Indians, who believed that the storm was that god walking across the water. Anyone who has ridden out a hurricane, and I have ridden out several, can well believe that it is. And if a hurricane isn't the Eye of the World, it's as close as we will come in this world.
