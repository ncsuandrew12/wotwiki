# [Interview #4: TOR Questions of the Week Part I, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#12)

#### Week 12 Question

You stated in another interview that Mat's memories came from adventurers who traveled through the
*ter'angreal*
. However several of Mat's memories end with the adventurer dying. Since adventurers probably didn't go through the
*ter'angreal*
after they died, how could the 'Finns have obtained these memories?

#### Robert Jordan

A good question. I was wondering when someone would ask that. I expected it as soon as Mat started revealing those old memories. At least a partial answer will be coming up in the next main sequence book, so I guess you could say this is a RAFO. But I will say that if I said those adventurers all entered through the two
*ter'angreal*
, I misspoke. A good many entered through the Tower of Ghenjei, which was more widely known in earlier years, if never exactly a household name.

#### Footnote

The misstatement in question comes from the
*Crossroads of Twilight*
prologue
