#### Week 4 Question

At recent book signing following the release of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, it was reported that you confirmed that the Forsaken Demandred has never posed as the man known as Mazrim Taim, who was introduced to Rand at the beginning of
*Lord of Chaos*
. Have you confirmed that Demandred has never posed as the man known as Mazrim Taim, leader of the Black Tower?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. Demandred has never posed as Mazrim Taim. All right, those of who fell over from the shock of a simple, straightforward answer can get up off the floor now. Sometimes, simple and straightforward can be the most devious of all, as any student of Aes Sedai will tell you.
