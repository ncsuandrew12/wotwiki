*saidin*
. So how does the Red Ajah and Cadsuane, find male channelers and then gentle them?

There are various ways that the effects of male channeling can be found, weaves that find the resonance of the residues of
*saidin*
. Check in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
. They do not detect the actual weaves, though, only the residues left after the weave is released. After that, it becomes a matter of detective work. Though perhaps stalking a leopard might be a better metaphor. As for Cadsuane, she has a few more tools at her disposal than other Aes Sedai, the reason for her extremely high success rate. Check
*Winter's Heart*
, and a few earlier mentions, for this one.
