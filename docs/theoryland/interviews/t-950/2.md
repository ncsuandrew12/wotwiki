# [Interview #950: AMOL Signing Report - Mageen, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=950#2)

#### Mageen

I have a question about who Gaidal and Birgitte might be reborn as. I was wondering if Gaidal could be the son of an Asha'man and if Birgitte might be reborn as an Aiel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Gaidal definitely could be, and there's a pretty big hint in
*Towers of Midnight*
that many folks online have found. As for Birgitte, it's possible.

#### Mageen

Do you know who Birgitte is reborn as?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Mageen

I think a case could be made for Melaine, as the Wise Ones talk about her time being near.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the WoT, a soul becomes tied to the body at viability.

#### Mageen

(As noted in the group Q&A per Robert Jordan.)

I think that's pretty much confirmation that Gaidal is Grady's son. I can't decide whether the comment on viability is to direct attention towards Elayne, as she is at that stage of pregnancy, confirmed by that crazy scene. I know in the torchat Brandon said the notes don't say who Melaine's children are, so maybe he's just stating everything he knows. I prefer to think that Elayne's children might be Calian and Shivan and would usher in the end of the current age. I look forward to the encyclopedia, that's for sure!
