# [Interview #950: AMOL Signing Report - Mageen, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=950#3)

#### Mageen

Can you shed any light on how the Rand/Elan body swap happened? I'm wondering whether it was like the Dark One's transmigration of souls, if it's tied to Rand's apparent new abilities, or something else.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not outlined in the notes, but I think of it as the soul that wanted to live found a body, and the one that wanted to die, did.

#### Mageen

I knew going in that Brandon has said RJ didn't explain how it happened, but a friend wanted me to ask and I'm glad I did! It was a much better answer than the shoulder shrug I expected based on the torchat.

Speaking of torchat, I noticed Brandon told someone that if they ask him on a tour stop, he might tell them who it was that helped Rand out of the cave. I'd be interested in knowing that and I would have asked that too if I'd remembered.
