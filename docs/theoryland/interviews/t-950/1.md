#### Mageen

KJacobs: Yes, thanks for
[asking about Verin's letters](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=946#2)
! I was going to ask that directly to Brandon but you saved me some time. :)

I wound up asking two questions directly to Brandon, about Birgitte and Gaidal and about the Rand/Moridin body swap, which a friend requested I ask. I'll write them out as close to verbatim as I recall.
