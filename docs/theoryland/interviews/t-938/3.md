# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#3)

#### Question

With the changeover from the young adult and the adult version, how much do you have to cut out for you to [say it's] appropriate for young children?

#### Harriet McDougal

None. What was done was that there was a forward, I guess you'd say, or a prologue written by my husband for the first volume of
*The Eye of the World*
in the YA version.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, but they didn't actually cut anything out; they just split the books into smaller volumes to entice the young readers into reading them. (laughter)

#### Harriet McDougal

That's right. And they got bigger type.

#### Footnote

The split version of
*The Eye of the World*
consists of
*From the Two Rivers*
and
*To the Blight*
. The extra prologue is called "Ravens"; it's an Egwene POV from when she was a child.
