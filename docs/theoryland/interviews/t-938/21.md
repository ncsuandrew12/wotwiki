#### Brandon Sanderson

All right, I have to call on Mr. Brent Weeks, because he . . .

#### Harriet McDougal

Because he is who he is.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He knows many assassins, I hear. (laughter) So if I don't call on him, I could be in trouble.

#### Brent Weeks

So I hear the Stormlight Archive is supposed to be ten books. So does that mean 15 or 20? (laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Stormlight Archive is supposed to be ten books. I'm hoping it will be ten books. It is two sequences of five, so you can ask me after the first five-book sequence where I am in my original outline. It should stay pretty close to that, I hope. I don't know. I used to be able to say everything stayed the same length I wanted it to be, but then my Wheel of Time book got split into three, so I can't say that any more.

#### Brent Weeks

Two years between books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, two years between books. They're very thick and involved, and I want to be doing other things as well. I like to jump projects—it's what keeps me fresh. It's what allows me to keep on doing this productively, and if I get stuck in one thing, no matter how much I love it, I find that I get less and less excited about it as time passes. But if I finish one book and skip to something else—like an Alcatraz book—for a little while and then jump back, I find my enthusiasm has come back to the beginning, where it was. And so I do a lot of jumping between projects.
