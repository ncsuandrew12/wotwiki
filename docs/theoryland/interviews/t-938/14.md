# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#14)

#### Question

So a lot of my consumption of all of the books by both Robert Jordan and yourself have been audiobooks. And so just curious from an art direction standpoint—since now the book is no longer the medium through which I'm encountering the story, it's through someone else's interpretation—how much art direction would you have in saying, hey this is how this character is or this is how . . . ?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, they read word for word. They're not edited. And really, as far as I know, there's no direction. They did ask for — at the beginning, with
*The Eye of the World*
, they wanted advice on pronunciations. (laughter)

And they got it, and they understood some of the instructions and missed a couple. (laughter) And I will tell you that the readers are a husband and wife of professional actors, both of them. But the woman's response—when she saw
*The Eye of the World*
, she said, "Why do you bother with a woman reader?" And the answer was: wait for the next book. (laughter)
