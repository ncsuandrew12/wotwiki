# [Interview #938, Entry #26]: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#26)

#### Anna Hornbostel

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

A fan asked him if Alivia's role in the epilogue was her fulfillment of Min's viewing and he said that it was very clear that that was all that that viewing meant. He said that fans are speculating that she played a part in the body swap but she did not.

Brandon went in to little detail about the body swap, saying he knows as much about it as we do and the notes just didn't give more. He asserted that he has to do with the balefire streams touching and the fact that Moridin no longer wanted to continue to exist but that Rand very much wanted to continue to exist.

#### Footnote

The viewing was almost certain a "riding into the sunset" metaphor, which we know is idiomatic to the WoT world from
*The Great Hunt*
Chapter 49, where Loial reads
*To Sail Beyond the Sunset*
(which is also a reference to Heinlein) as Rand accepts the oaths of the Shienarans, the first Dragonsworn.
