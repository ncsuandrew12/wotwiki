# [Interview #938, Entry #28]: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#28)

#### Anna Hornbostel

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Brandon told a fan that the
*Alloy*
sequel will be called
*Shadows of Self*
. I then asked about the title for the next Stormlight book and Brandon laughed and said "Don't ask me that" so I guess we will have to wait on that!
