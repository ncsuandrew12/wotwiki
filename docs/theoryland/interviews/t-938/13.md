# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#13)

#### Question

Is everything in the Wheel of Time just like a big chess game between the Creator and the Dark One? And if so, or even if not, why is the Creator so sort of hands-off, while the Dark One is talking to minions?

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet, do you have any insight on this one?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, this may sound silly, but I think the real answer for you is to be found in the Book of Job, where there is a tremendously hands-off Creator. And I personally have always had a lot of trouble with the Book of Job. But Robert Jordan was brought up Baptist, and was brought up in the belief that the Bible in one man's hands is enough to get that man to heaven, to the presence of God, in the long run. And I think that there are no churches in the Wheel of Time, they're very aware of goodness. They know what the Light is, even though they're not talking to it. If that helps.

#### Question

Yes, thank you.
