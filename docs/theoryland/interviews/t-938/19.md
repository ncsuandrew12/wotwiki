# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#19)

#### Question

Is any more stuff planned from the Wheel of Time universe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, excellent question. I should have put this during the frequently asked ones at the beginning. Are there any more plans to do anything else with the Wheel of Time universe?

#### Harriet McDougal

No, there are not. The encyclopedia was put under contract in my husband's lifetime. He did enter into a contract for a trilogy of novels that are not part of the series but set in the world. He left either one or two sentences about that trilogy, which is not enough for anyone to work with so that it would very much still be his. He also said that—in the trade, it's called sharecropping in somebody's universe—and he said if anybody tries to sharecrop in my universe, I'll take out the hard disk, and I'll rent a semi—or a big rig, you might say, since his name was Rigney—and I will drive it backwards and forwards over the hard drive three or four times to be sure that no one will be able to do it. He really didn't want it done. And since he made it clear in his last months and weeks that he really did want the series finished, you have the end of the series, but there won't be any more done in the Wheel of Time world. [applause]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Along those lines, though, I will mention—people ask a lot—the film rights are held by Universal Pictures, and they're working toward feature films, one film per book. We don't know how far along they are. They have a second draft of a screenplay, which I have not seen. They're on a second draft.

#### Harriet McDougal

And I haven't either.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, and Harriet hasn't either. There is one other little tidbit—there's an anthology coming out called
*Unfettered*
. It's a charity anthology for a member of our community, in the science fiction and fantasy community, who had huge medical bills. And in order to help pay those off, we donated a deleted sequence from
*A Memory of Light*
. It's something that was written, but we decided for pacing reasons did not fit in the book. And so we donated that to
*Unfettered*
and so you can read that to see something behind the scenes. I will admit it's much more me than Robert Jordan, but it is something that we cut from
*A Memory of Light*
, just it didn't fit, pacing-wise, in the book.
