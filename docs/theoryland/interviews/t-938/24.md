# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#24)

#### Anna Hornbostel

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Brandon stated that it was evident to him from the notes that it was
[always planned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_Roland)
that Olver would be the one to blow the Horn at the Last Battle. He also said that there is no direct proof but that he would like to think that Olver did indeed get his chance to train with the Aiel.
