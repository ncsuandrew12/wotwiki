# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#10)

#### Question

How did you end up with a 190-page-long chapter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a 190-page chapter in the book, in this book. And it was done very intentionally. I actually planned it that way from the beginning in my outline, the goal being that that's a point in the book where the characters can't just put down their weapons and stop, and I did not want the readers to be able to put down the book at that point. And a lot of people say, "Well, I'll just read one more chapter." (laughter) I wanted you to feel like they did at the end of that chapter, where they have been, and involved in something that is just draining emotionally, mentally, and physically, and the closest...the best way I can think of to make you have empathy for them was to push you through the same thing.

#### Question

It worked! (applause)

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's authors getting tricksy, is what it is.
