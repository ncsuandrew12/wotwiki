# [Interview #938: AMOL Signing Report - Anna Hornbostel, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=938#20)

#### Question

Are either you now, or else in the encyclopedia—are you going to answer who killed Asmodean? (laughter)

#### Harriet McDougal

I wish to stand up for librarians, writers of indexes, and in this case, writers of glossaries. Glossaries need to be read very carefully, particularly—which one is it? (laughter) Particularly the glossary of
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### Question

Thank you.

#### Harriet McDougal

Somebody told me I was being a smartass. (laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, okay. All right.
