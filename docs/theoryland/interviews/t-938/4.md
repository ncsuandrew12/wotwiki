#### Question

So, I'll skip right to the end. Uh, spoilers...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, wait, wait wait! We can't ask any spoilers for the last book. You can ask them when you come through the line however, and I will happily answer them.

#### Question

That's all I came for.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah. Just go ahead and ask [in the line]. The problem is...just a show of hands: how many people haven't finished the book yet? See, this is why. (laughter)
