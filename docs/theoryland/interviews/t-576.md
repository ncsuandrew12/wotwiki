## Summary

## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#1)

#### Terez

I put all the quotes in the database earlier but I figured I'd do a roundup. There are a few questions I didn't include either because they weren't WoT-related or because I didn't find them to be all that relevant to our HCFF interests. They are footnoted and slightly edited for prettiness.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#2)

#### [Matthías Páll (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/tritlo/status/1707820323966977)

How many rounds are there in the Age of Legends game
*sha'rah*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1708604159692800)

MAFO

#### [Maria Simons](http://twitter.com/MariaLSimons/status/1709305401180160)

And I can't answer that MAFO off the top of my head.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#3)

#### [John Lewis (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/Gigalew/status/1715953654046723)

Were those fellas in red veils human or Shadowspawn?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1721589368365056)

RAFO. :)

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#4)

#### [Ashiya Kapadi (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/Apy12/status/1716685102915584)

Who on earth is Nakomi?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1720530759585793)

RAFO. :) I'm leaving that one open to interpretation.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#5)

#### [Shivam Bhatt (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/1709008721289216)

Ch. 48-49. Was that all in Jordan's notes? So so sad and dark!

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1710073248227328)

I'm avoiding answering questions about what was specifically in the notes and what wasn't, for now.

#### [Shivam Bhatt](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/1710705623433217)

Ok, well, can you comment on your own feelings of those chapters, as a fan?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1713185094631424)

Awesome but very disturbing. As a fan, they're discomforting.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#6)

#### [Linda Sandström  (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/linksan/status/1714369071157248)

Are Aviendha's children conceived naturally or are they a consequence of something Power-related Rand and Aviendha do together?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1717536521461760)

RAFO. :)

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#7)

#### [Jeff Edde (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/JeffEdde/status/1713126508593152)

The names for kids in Aviendha's vision: Were they from the notes for outrigger books? Or written up by you?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1716113469603842)

I'll answer that specifically after the books are all out.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#8)

#### [Brian Cayen (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BRCayen/status/1710903640719360)

You've said in the past that Aviendha's voice was one the hardest for you to write....is this still the case?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1713613861552128)

It still takes the longest to prepare for, but it is no longer as difficult as it was.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#9)

#### [Matt Williams (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/Willi2md/status/1712512185671681)

Was the fog in
*The Path of Daggers*
during the fight between Toram Riatin and Rand a bubble of evil or did Fain control the fog?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1715755729035264)

RAFO.

#### Footnote

The glossary referred to it as a bubble of evil.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#10)

#### [Ty Margheim (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/alSeen14/status/1716242322825216)

What did we miss that would have told us who killed Asmodean?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1720872192712704)

I don't think people missed it. RJ said it was obvious, and many guessed it correctly. So I'd say they got it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1721122982731776)

If you ask on a fan site, they can get you the 'Sherlock Holmes' style investigation of the subject. It is right.

#### [Matt Hatch](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/1718054408949760)

Was Asmodean killed with balefire? And when will additional details regarding his death be released?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1718914736197632)

I will see if I can give additional details. I'll ask Maria and Harriet for their read.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#11)

#### [Xarra (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/xarra/status/1714063033765888)

You said at a book tour that we'd seen Demandred lots already—is this true? Has he been 'on screen' in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1716595525165056)

I was being jokey on that one, meaning the times he's appeared as himself or been referenced as himself.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1716710482649088)

I have not answered if we've seen him 'in disguise' yet. Or I didn't intend to. Might have sounded that way.

#### Footnote

Brandon
[has previously indicated](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=479)
that Demandred's alter ego has not been seen on screen as of
*Knife of Dreams*
. RJ also had
[previously stated](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=162#8)
that we had not seen Demandred's alter ego on screen as of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#12)

#### [Matt Hatch (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/thedustywheel/status/1710430636478464)

Is Logain working for Demandred?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1711865398824961)

Oh, you KNEW I was going to RAFO that one.

#### [Matt Hatch](http://twitter.com/thedustywheel/status/1717515268915201)

How often does Demandred contemplate killing Moridin?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1719236233789440)

Less than the other Chosen. He is focused on Rand. He contemplates Moridin, but mostly he wants Rand.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#13)

#### [sleepinghour (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/1714455775813632)

Who is the best swordsman in WoT right now? Lan, Galad, or Gawyn?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1717719166615552)

Lan. Then Galad. Then Gawyn. Gawyn is luckier than he thinks he is.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#14)

#### [Adam Stillwaggon (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/still_thedragon/status/1713793079967745)

Who was bringing the Trollocs through the Portal Stone to attack Perrin and the Whitecloaks?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1716378293772289)

RAFO. :)

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#15)

#### [Brian Cayen (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BRCayen/status/1716704237322240)

I can't figure it out....what was the "little thing" that was missed [from books 4-6]?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1720406956314624)

End of Chapter 55 [in
*Towers of Midnight*
].

#### Footnote

This refers to the
*ashandarei*
, which provided a way out of the Tower of Ghenjei.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#16)

#### [Matthías Páll (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/tritlo/status/1717128054968320)

Will we see more from Shara or the Land of the Madmen?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1719910497521664)

RJ said there would be no major action in Shara. He was uncertain on Madmen.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#17)

#### [Spencer Pranger (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/spencerpanger/status/1710768974200832)

Why is Hoid trying to restore the Pattern?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1713443824476160)

Lol. Hoid has no involvement in anything WoT. :)

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#18)

#### [Matthías Páll (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/tritlo/status/1717293155360768)

Who is your favorite character, and why?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1719406061162496)

Perrin, because I feel like him most of the time.

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#19)

#### [Ty Margheim (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/alSeen14/status/1717146002399232)

Are the prophecies competing a la
*The Belgariad*
(by David Eddings), or are they complementary?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1719523350675456)

Not competing like
*The Belgariad*
, and certainly not intelligent like in
*The Belgariad*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1719763088703488)

Some may be interpreted wrong, others may be recorded wrong, but there is not a this/that nature to them.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#20)

#### [Luke Piper (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/ShouldBWriting/status/1712303418384384)

Which character kept you up at night worrying the most?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1714973159981056)

Rand. In both books.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#21)

#### [pmisir (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/pmisir/status/1716782750507008)

Re:
*A Memory of Light*
, I hope there'll be tons more Tuon/Seanchan?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1720087509737472)

There will be more than there was in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=576#22)

#### [Matt Hatch (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/thedustywheel/status/1714920747966465)

Did Verin know the weave to hide her channeling ability from being detected by another female channeler?

#### [Maria Simons (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/MariaLSimons/status/1715614963994624)

Sneaky sneaky Verin knew a lot. And that's all I have to say at the moment.
