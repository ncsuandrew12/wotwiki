# [Interview #363, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Update + Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=363#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was planning to post
*Warbreaker*
6.0 today, but my editor is getting back to me with just a couple of line edits on some of the rewritten scenes, so I figured I'd wait until he got to me, then post 6.1 instead. For those who are fans of Lightsong, there's an entire new scene with him in this version. Only ten pages long in manuscript form, so by no means expansive, but it is completely new. I think you'll enjoy it.

Anyway, because of the lack of a
*Warbreaker*
update, I posted two new
*Mistborn: The Well of Ascension*
Annotations.
