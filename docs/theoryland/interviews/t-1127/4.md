#### Question

In transitioning from Merin to Kaladin, was there any plot sacrifices that were particularly difficult for me?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. I had been disappointed enough in the way that Merin turned out in the original draft of The Way of Kings, that transitioning to someone more vibrant and more interesting in Kaladin really didnâ€™t feel like a sacrifice to me.
