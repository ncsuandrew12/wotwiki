#### Andrew

Will White Sand still be considered an adaptation, or will it be considered canon, the canon version of its content?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Andrew, right now I’m declaring the White Sand graphic novel to be the canon version of its content. We will see how that goes, but that’s what I’m planning right now.
