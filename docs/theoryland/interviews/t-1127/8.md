#### Jason

What can we expect from Dark One, specifically what kind of magic system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Jason, the magic systems in Dark One, focus on, right now, on a person who can steal people’s souls and use them to make magic objects, mixed with an electricity type world, where the ground is electrified, and animals, plants and animals, have an, a symbiosis with electricity, like you’ll see a tree that has a Jacob’s ladder going up it, or you’ll see ah, a beast that uses spittle like a taser, that should be the next
book that I work on for Random House after the Steelheart trilogy, so we will see.
