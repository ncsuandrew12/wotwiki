#### Question

Is there a formula on Nalthis for Breath consumption per Awakening? For example, how many Breaths does it take Vivi to Awaken a scarf?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I have that in my notes, it’s been a long time since I’ve written on that book, yes, there was a formula for me and I will use it when I write the sequel.
[Note: Vivi was an abbreviation for Vivienna because there was a limit on the question length.]
