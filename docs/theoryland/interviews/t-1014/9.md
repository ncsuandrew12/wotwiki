#### Question

What was your biggest hesitation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What if I screw this up? I would be known as the one who ruined the Wheel of Time, which would be awful for me as a fan of the series. That was a real thing, me thinking there was no way I could win at this, that I couldn't do it as well as Robert Jordan wouldâ€”nobody can. They came to me because I was a fan who became a published writer. Going to someone who was not a fan but was a writer who specialized in writing other people's property, I worried it would just be another job to them. Knowing it was in the hands of someone who cares... That's what made me say yes.
