#### Question

Why steel? What about it was so attractive that you wanted to create a world around it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wanted to turn a city to steel. I liked the image. I'm always looking for interesting visuals for my books. I liked this idea of everything having been turned to steel to the point that nothing works anymore. Then I liked this idea of catacombs burrowed into the steel underneath the city for the lower folk to live in. It's a little bit cyberpunkâ€”that whole concept of the steel underground. Then of course there's steel as a metaphor for superheroes.
