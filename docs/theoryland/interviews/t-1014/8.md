# [Interview #1014: Kindle Daily Post Interview, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1014#8)

#### Question

Of course it wouldn't be an interview without asking about Wheel of Time. How has that experience informed the storytelling you've done since?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Watching how the community interacted with Wheel of Time was eye-opening. There are a lot of book series out there that sell a lot of copies, and yet they have not inspired the fan base and the devotion Wheel of Time has. I would rather have that than the thrillers that sell three times as many copies, and yet people read them and throw them away. They don't throw conventions, they don't have these deep discussions. What was it that Robert Jordan did that did this to all of us? That I've thought about a lot.

Writing specifically, juggling multiple viewpoints has become easier for me since I was forced to lift heavy weights. I had to jump into a series where I had to juggle two dozen viewpoints instead of the three or four I was used to.
