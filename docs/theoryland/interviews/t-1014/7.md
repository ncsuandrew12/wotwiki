#### Question

Going back to characters: Stormlight Archive is very character drivenâ€”each book essentially focuses on one character. Who will we learn more about in Words of Radiance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the second book Shallan becomes the focus, though I would honestly say there is as much Kaladin in in the second book as there is in the first book. In the first book the things Shallan was doing were important and fun, but at the same time her plot line was intentionally disjointed because I was setting up what's happening in this book.
