## Entry #1

#### Hawk

Originally I was going to skip this signing since I (A) didn't finish the book until Monday and (B) have been to so many of these before but Batya wouldn't stop bothering me until I agreed to go.

While I was one of those near the back of the line (though not quite out the door), I had a surprising amount of fun. At the store I managed to bump into someone I know, have some fun debates with the people in line around me, was introduced to a Discovery Zone book about Dungeons and Torture for kids, discover that RJ
*still*
remembers who I am, and was able to hang around and listen to RJ speak. Since only one of us in my group had finished
*Winter's Heart*
, there were very few questions asked about that book.

## Entry #2

#### Question

Why was the glossary so short?

#### Robert Jordan

Normally he solicits opinion from people what should be in there, but he ran out of time this book. He would have liked it to have been more fleshed out.

## Entry #3

#### Question

Have you ever seen "Army of Darkness"? There's a scene in there where Ash (the protagonist) smashes the mirror and mini dopplegangers come out of each shard.

#### Robert Jordan

No. When did the movie come out?

#### Footnote

*Army of Darkness*
was released
[on October 9, 1992](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/releaseinfo)
...and
*The Shadow Rising*
was released on September 15, 1992. Looks like both parties are innocent (not that most fans of WoT would have minded if RJ had referenced the movie).

## Entry #4

#### Question

What was the use of Elayne's "rod" in
*The Path of Daggers*
?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO and he's surprised at the imaginations of some of the female fans who mail him—their imaginations are quite vivid.

#### Footnote

This was explained in
*Winter's Heart*
, 'A Lily in Winter'.

## Entry #5

#### Question

Was there ever a Purple Ajah?

#### Robert Jordan

They were going to, but they ran off to New Orleans and started up a biker bar instead.

## Entry #6

#### Question

There were a lot of fans upset at your decision to sell the Prologue to S&S as an ebook, and there were other people upset at your "special introduction", thinking that you were mocking your fans. What was your intent/how did this come about?

#### Robert Jordan

People who got upset about the "special introduction" need to "take a break and get a milkshake." The introduction was definitely about mocking ebooks and how it really did feel like selling your soul. S&S came to him and begged for something—anything—to sell from
*Winter's Heart*
as an ebook. He didn't go to them at all.

#### Question

Do you think you'll ever put the books out in electronic format?

#### Robert Jordan

When there's a reader that he can "drop in the water, dry with a hair dryer, and then read" he'll move over to ebooks. He's also waiting for the industry to hash out its standards. He expects that to take another 5 years or so.

## Entry #7

#### Question

How many more books? [No one I was with was stupid enough to ask.]

#### Robert Jordan

At least three more.

## Entry #8

#### Hawk

Nominees for quotes of the evening:

#### Robert Jordan

"One time when Harriet asked me what I wanted for dinner, I told her to read and find out."

#### A fan

"If you die before the series ends I will desecrate your grave."

## Entry #9

#### Hawk

All in all, I'm glad I went. The crowd was definitely less than previous years; however, I feel much of that has to do with the fact that this event was barely advertised. It did give me a chance to get my book personalized, at least.
