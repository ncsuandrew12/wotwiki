# [Interview #33: LOC Signing Report - Pam Korda, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=33#3)

#### David Wren Hardin

Was Tam involved in the Whitecloak/Illian war mentioned by Pedron Niall in
*Lord of Chaos*
?

#### Robert Jordan

That isn't something I'd given much consideration to (i.e., it is background, not significant). He probably was, since he was in the Illian army then. (i.e., Tam is NOT Jain Farstrider).
