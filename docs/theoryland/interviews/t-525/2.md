#### Brandon Sanderson

Before the 21st I'll have turned in the final revision of
*Towers of Midnight*
, which I'm currently working on. You can follow my progress on

or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
; the deadline is August 16th and I need to finish over 10% of the book each day until then. I did the first 12% yesterday. This final draft mostly focuses on issues the beta readers noticed.
