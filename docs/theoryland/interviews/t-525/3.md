# [Interview #525, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Writing for Charity + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=525#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

A couple of weeks ago on Writing Excuses, Dan, Howard, and I did some example line editing on the beginning of
[the first novel I wrote](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/07/25/)
. It went over very well, so in this week's episode we return to
*White Sand*
and
[line edit the dialogue](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/08/08/)
. You want to listen to it, right?

In the most recent
*Warbreaker*
annotations I talk about chapter four. First I discuss
[the name system used in the book](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/377/Warbreaker-Chapter-Four)
, and then I cover
[Hawaii and the undead](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/378/Warbreaker-Chapter-Four-Part-2)
.
