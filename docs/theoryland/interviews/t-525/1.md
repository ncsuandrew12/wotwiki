# [Interview #525: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Writing for Charity + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=525#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

On August 21st there will be a writing workshop in South Sandy, Utah whose purpose is to raise money to donate to schoolchildren. Specifically, they hope to donate a book to every child "in at least ten of the lowest socioeconomic populated schools in the state"â€”at least 6,000 books total. Author Shannon Hale told me about the program, and I'm going to be attending the evening extravaganza. As this is a charity event, there is a registration fee both for the writing workshop during the day and the extravaganza in the evening. For more information, please
