# [Interview #374: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: AMoL Update + Alcatraz Sample Chapter, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=374#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

First off, if you missed my
[big update of stuff](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/692/Back-from-DragonCon-with-Many-Updates)
, you might find some items of interest there.

I'm still recovering from Dragon\*Con. it was exhausting, but I was very glad that I went! I got to see a lot of great people, meet some old friends, and run into several groups I'd never met in person (that's you, GeorgaDawn and the LibraryThing folks.) I'll probably go again next year, if only because I feel I really NEED to bring my wife to this thing. She's been to Worldcon, but she really has no clue how truly bizarre some of this all can get. . . . ;)
