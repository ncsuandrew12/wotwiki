# [Interview #374: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: AMoL Update + Alcatraz Sample Chapter, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=374#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I realized that during my previous update, I didn't do anything
*Alcatraz*
-related, so I figured I'd better update that side of things as well. I've gone ahead and transferred chapter one from its old place to the shiny
[new location in the Library](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/33/Alcatraz-Chapter-One)
. I'll be posting some sample chapters of
*Alcatraz*
Two in the upcoming months. For those of you who are fans of my epic fantasy, I really do suggest you look into
*Alcatraz*
when it comes out in paperback next month. I think you'll be pleased with what you findâ€”think of one of my stories, only more lighthearted with a humorous slant on the magic system.
