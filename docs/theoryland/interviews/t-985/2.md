# [Interview #985: Rithmatist Signing Report - StormAtlas, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=985#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Someone in the crowd asked about a possible Alcatraz 5, to which Sanderson responded that he'd actually started working on an outline for it and a few chapters, but it had been slow going because he had to buy back the rights for the book. Sanderson then proceeded to read an intro to one of his chapters that he refers to as an epigraph which was pretty funny.
