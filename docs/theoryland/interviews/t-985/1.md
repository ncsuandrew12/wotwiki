# [Interview #985: Rithmatist Signing Report - StormAtlas, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=985#1)

#### StormAtlas

I live in South America but while on vacation here in the states got a chance to see Brandon Sanderson at his signing in Albuquerque, NM. He said it was his last stop on the tour so apologized ahead of time if he started ranting. However, he did an excellent presentation and admitted to having gotten a chance to edit a chapter from
*Words of Radiance*
just before the signing.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

As has been mentioned before, Sanderson has said that he hopes to have
*Words of Radiance*
out in November, but couldn't promise anything. He also mentioned, though, that they were talking about a January release, which would be a year from the day that
*A Memory of Light*
was released. Then he cracked an awesome joke about New Mexicans being use to waiting anyway, so we will be fine (because G.R.R Martin lives in NM).
