#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Someone asked if he planned to do more with
*Legion*
, to which he replied that was working on something else, and that he hoped to be able to turn
*Legion*
into a mini-series like the BBC's Sherlock Holmes.

*Legion*
, but stopped about two paragraphs in as he realized how unorganized he'd written it the rough draft and kept getting lost.
