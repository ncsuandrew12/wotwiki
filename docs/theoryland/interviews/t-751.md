## [Entry #1](./t-751/1)

I was at the Sydney event too and asked him two questions afterwards when he was signing my books.

## [Entry #2](./t-751/2)

#### dicetosser

Will there be Wolfsisters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO with a grin.

## [Entry #3](./t-751/3)

#### dicetosser

Is speaking to Wolves hereditary?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RJ's notes say it is a soul-bound ability which basically means every time Perrin Noam and Elyas are born they will have the ability to speak to wolves.

## [Entry #4](./t-751/4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also the idea of putting Asmodean's killer's identity in the glossary was his...kinda. RJ left a print-out of a reader's theory with a sticky note on it saying "this is right". That's it; nothing else. They tried figuring out how to get it in the story, then Brandon being a bit of a smartypants suggested the glossary. Apparently Harriet LOVED the idea so much that later when he tried to write it into the story she crossed it out and wrote "IT'S IN THE GLOSSARY!"

## [Entry #5](./t-751/5)

#### dicetosser

#### Brandon Sanderson

He also did a reading from a new book he's putting together and that may become a TV series. About a genius kid who solves problems and is an incredible learner but is a bit insane. The way he learns is that every skill he leans like identifying writing styles becomes a new hallucination! And he is quite open about them being hallucinations! And some hallucinations are themselves crazy! So if he is asked to speak another language then HE can't! But the hallucination translates while he pronounces it badly. That's how Sanderson explained it.
