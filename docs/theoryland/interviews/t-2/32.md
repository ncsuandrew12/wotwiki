# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#32)

Does Min's comment to Corele mean that the Dark One can subvert her viewings BEFORE the Pattern is destroyed?

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19945433271)

Asked in reference to the viewing that Elza would serve Rand. Or did it simply not imply she would serve forever?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19948746931)

Elza did serve Rand, in her own way. It did not mean forever. That was not a subverting of the viewing. (Or wasn't meant to be.)

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19950057141)

Thanks! That's what I thought but some will still say you didn't answer the original question lol. It's Theoryland.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19950370003)

Robert Jordan taught me to give Aes Sedai answers.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19950472403)

Fair enough. :)

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20081029375)

There is one case in which I suspect that RJ gave an Aes Sedai answer and the reporter may not have gotten it exactly.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20081067739)

Q: Was Else always Lanfear? RJ: No. Else did exist as a separate human but was played by Lanfear after Else was expelled.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20081129526)

Strange, because of the personality 'Else' showed, and the Tear trap being Mesaana's trap, not Lanfear's. Any comment?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20111147050)

MAFO.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/answers-to-a-few-mafo-questions-r658)

(later) I cannot find anything to clarify the question.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19955840592)

PS, thanks for taking time to do Q&A here. Far superior to tour reports, since the Aes Sedai answers are direct from you. ;)

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19957821402)

...not to mention the quick responses, and the fact that you have more time to think the answers out. You are awesome!

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19969822974)

By the way, not knocking the tour reporters. They rock; we have a lot of good stuff because of them.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/19969927213)

I am just reminded of Tam. 'Tell me what she said. Her exact words, mind, just as she said them.' And Thom too. :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20105943694)

Sure. Of course, I'm not convinced half of Theoryland hasn't joined Twitter only to follow/question me...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20106093348)

When I'm on tour, do be aware that I don't have notes handy and I'm usually very tired. All answers are suspect.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/#%21/Terez27/status/20109207833)

As for stalking you...someone has to do it to keep the Q&A organized, and I elected myself (also before you came along).

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20111465233)

Ha. Just seems that I get a surprising number of tweets from people with no profile picture, and who are only following me. :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20111525948)

I don't feel stalked at all. This is how I use Twitter, and I'm happy to answer questions.

#### [Matt Hatch](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/20114385551)

No profile pics and only following you? That sounds like my twenty other Twitter accounts...

#### Footnote

Min and Cadsuane told Corele that she sees pieces of the Pattern, but if the Dark One destroys the Pattern as he aims to do, then her viewings will be irrelevant. Those that are in reference to things after the Last Battle will only come to pass if they prevent the Dark One from destroying the Pattern. Some took this to mean that Shaidar Haran (essentially, the Dark One) subverted Min's viewing that Elza would serve Rand when he ordered Elza to help Semirhage torture and control Rand.
