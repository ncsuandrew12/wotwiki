Are the Chosen aware of Taim's existence? They never address him even in their thoughts.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20915806259)

RAFO. (You totally knew I was going to do that.)

#### Footnote

In Kisman's POV (WH 22) we learn that Demandred ordered the renegades to kill Rand, but not to tell anyone of the order, including Taim. And of course, we know that Aginor/Osan'gar/Dashiva was aware of Taim.
