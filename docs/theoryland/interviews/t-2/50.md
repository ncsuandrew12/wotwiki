# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #50](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#50)

One thing that confuses me about Asmodean's murder is that RJ said most people who emailed him were wrong. Surprising?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20844152160)

No, not surprising. Even if one of the common theories is right, then most people emailing are wrong.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20844207598)

For sake of argument, suppose a popular theory is correct. The fact that there are hundreds of theories...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20844241575)

...means that even if 1/3 of people choose the right theory, 2/3 pick one of the other many theories.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20844259756)

So whether it's a common theory or an obscure one, most people emailing are wrong.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20857035807)

Hundreds? There are less than 10 viable suspects I think, LOL. Maybe 15 if you stretch it.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20859670746)

You are probably aware that RJ was willing to eliminate a suspect for Asmodean at two times: in 2001 and in 2005.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20859777185)

In 2001 he eliminated Rand on a general question; in 2005 at DragonCon he eliminated Fain from a list of suspects.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20859826499)

I think it is time for one more! With only 1.5 years to go, it would be nice to have it narrowed down one more time.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20860015166)

This with knowledge that you'd probably have to ask permission, and that it would be the last time before the reveal.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20860301234)

The new list should probably be: Lanfear, Graendal, Aviendha, Taim, Slayer, Moiraine, Sammael, Moridin.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20860409184)

I don't think anyone seriously argues anyone else, though I could be wrong.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (11 August)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20868122930)

I will ask if I can eliminate one, just for you.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20915750885)

Lol. Well, I guess there IS a faction that doesn't care:

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/20916262737)

For Asmodean's killer revelation, will it just be an outright name or will it be explained how it happened and such?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20946829766)

Afraid that's a RAFO.

#### [Isabel](http://twitter.com/Isabelsedai/status/20946527291)

@Brandon Sanderson and Team Jordan: please don't rule out anyone who could have killed Asmodean.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 August)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20954403450)

Ha. But so many are begging for an elimination. And it has been years.

#### Footnote

He never did eliminate a suspect because it was revealed in
*Towers of Midnight*
, which he was of course not at liberty to tell us before the book came out. (We knew he wouldn't do an elimination in that case; we only wanted one if we were going to have to wait until
*A Memory of Light*
came out to find out who killed him.)
