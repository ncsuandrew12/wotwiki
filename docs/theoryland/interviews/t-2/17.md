Did RJ have a strength scale for each of the Five Powers for each channeler (similar to the one for overall strength)?

Not that I've seen. Now, there could be something in there I haven't seen.

But the list I have indicates power level and, in some cases, what they are strong/weak at. Not a full list of all five.
