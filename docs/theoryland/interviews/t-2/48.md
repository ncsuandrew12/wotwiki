# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #48](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#48)

I thought of a Lan question. Did Elyas really teach Lan anything about the Blight? Or was that a TEOTWism?

I have a feeling you are going to MAFO that. Does @MariaLSimons play Magic? Surely we can bribe her with something.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20822816934)

I've never questioned that one, so I haven't thought to ask about it or look it up. Is there a reason I should wonder?

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/20830999539)

Only that Lan was practically raised in the Blight by the Malkieri. Wouldn't think Elyas could teach him much about it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20851638337)

That is a good point. I'll go ahead and do as you said and MAFO that one. You might be right; might be an EoTWism.

I can’t find anything to clarify this, either. I will just offer up anecdote: I have been reading WoT for 22 years, and went to work for its creator over 17 years ago. I could be said to live and breathe The Wheel of Time. But Terez has taught me much about WoT. It could be a TEOTWism, or Lan could have been thinking of some very specific things that Elyas shared that he found helpful.

#### Footnote—Terez

I thought about asking how Elyas could teach Lan anything about the sword, too, but I figured the Blight bit was the most incredible. TEOTWism: this was stolen from the fandom for Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series. The first book of that series is called
*Gardens of the Moon*
, and in that fandom, details that are particular to the first book—details that cause continuity issues later in the series—are referred to as GOTMisms.
