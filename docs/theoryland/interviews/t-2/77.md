Masema: was he being manipulated by a Forsaken from the start? His dealings with Suroth, and him not wanting to go to Rand?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21312618674)

Masema was not manipulated from the start, but once he was noticed as a potentially useful tool.

#### [HBFFERREIRA](http://twitter.com/HBFFerreira/status/21339552374)

Both his dealings with Suroth and his mistrust of Perrin in
*The Path of Daggers*
were Forsaken-induced, right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (17 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21381625219)

Influenced at the least. Depends on how you view induced.
