What did we miss that would have told us who killed Asmodean?

I don't think people missed it. RJ said it was obvious, and many guessed it correctly. So I'd say they got it.

If you ask on a fan site, they can get you the 'Sherlock Holmes' style
[investigation](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4975913/1/Sherlock_Holmes_Examines_the_Death_of_Asmodean)
of the subject. It is right.

#### Footnote

RJ was joking when he said it was 'intuitively obvious'.
