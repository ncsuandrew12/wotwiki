Re: Mesaana. People have been misquoting me a lot on this one. Early in the tour someone claimed to have a quote where RJ said...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=174351828546&id=621235008)

...that her alter ego hadn't been seen. This shocked me, since I thought she had been. I have been waiting until I got home to check it out.

The only thing official I have said is that someone claimed RJ said on the
*Knife of Dreams*
tour that she hadn't been seen, and can say nothing until...

...I am off tour and can research old RJ interviews to find if I've missed something. I think it likely the person was mixed up.

(later) Word from Maria: RJ said we HAVE seen Mesaana's alter ego on screen.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=191408489168&id=621235008)

That's good. The guy from DC had me worried. I thought I'd known from the notes exactly who Mesaana was, and that she has been on screen...

#### Footnote

Robert Mee, the guy who provided the
[original quote](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=174#2)
from RJ confirming that Mesaana had been on screen, told me in an email that he might have been the one to cause all of this confusion since he misremembered the quote when he talked to Brandon. He's probably right, as he saw Brandon in Bailey's Crossroads on Nov. 4, and the confusion first showed up a few days later. He sends along his apologies to everyone!
