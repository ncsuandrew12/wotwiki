Quick, and, perhaps, rather rude question: was Mattin Stepaneos simply forgotten about in
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### [ERIK WETTER](http://twitter.com/erik_wetter/status/19725992687)

His presence in
*Knife of Dreams*
implied that he'd play some role in the story, yet he's not even mentioned in
*The Gathering Storm*
. Just need to know.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19776734945)

Nope. I thought about referencing him, but found it distracting. He isn't forgotten.
