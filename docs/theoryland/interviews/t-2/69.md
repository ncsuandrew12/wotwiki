Do you ever feel that you're sharing too much info with all these updates?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21125683173)

Don't know. I worry about it mostly for Harriet's sake. I try to reign myself in, actually. I'd probably share more...

...but I don't want to make Harriet uncomfortable. This isn't my world, it's hers.
