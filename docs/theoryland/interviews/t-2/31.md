# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#31)

Are the taint and the True Power the same?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (29 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19857630947)

No, they are different.

#### [AZRAL HANAN](http://twitter.com/Azral_Joe/status/19815232772)

Can Mashadar destroy True Power and True Power weaves like it destroyed the taint?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19857693201)

RAFO.

#### [AZRAL HANAN](http://twitter.com/Azral_Joe/status/19815232772)

If there was no Cleansing would the taint eventually run out as it's used by men who go insane & die
*ad infinitum*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19857693201)

I don't think it'd run out. But that's a "Brandon's mostly sure, but hasn't checked the notes."

#### [AZRAL HANAN (30 JULY)](http://twitter.com/Azral_Joe/status/19902879452)

Did Mr. Jordan list out what the True Power can/not do relative to the One Power? Are there limits to both?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19946814527)

RAFO. Maybe we'll put some of that in the encyclopedia. They are certainly different.
*Towers of Midnight*
has some hints.

#### [BENJAMIN MOLDOVAN](http://twitter.com/jaminben73/status/19921455903)

Mashadar is gone, isn't it? Would it really hurt to say whether the True Power would be affected?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19948397334)

Have we ever confirmed that Mashadar is dead? :)
