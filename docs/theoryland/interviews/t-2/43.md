Why is the Dragon 'one with the Land'? Is it just due to him being
*ta'veren*
or is there more to it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20123481371)

More to it. More about being the Dragon than being
*ta'veren*
. Who he is.

So it's more than a title or being
*ta'veren*
and Hero of the Horn? The Dragon plays its own unique role in the Pattern?

Note that Prophecy says that the Dragon specifically is reborn time after time.

RJ said the soul is immortal. But Hopper says dying in the Wolf Dream is likely permanent. Is Hopper wrong?

RAFO, for now. Ask again after the last book is out.
