Any chance you could clear up Sulin in
*The Gathering Storm*
? Was her appearance a typo or deliberate (Varied answers exist on the web)?

Sure, you guys deserve an answer on this one.

Sulin began life as a simple typo. When I saw it, I shrugged, and had a good reason. Maria thought that reason would not work.

So we decided to retcon it out. Mistake was mine all along. Really nothing special to report there, I'm afraid.
