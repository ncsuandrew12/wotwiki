# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#42)

#### [Matt Hagerman (1 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/raggy736/status/20117652777)

Is it harder to write a novel with the amount of detailed notes Mr. Jordan left as opposed to creating the world yourself?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20123277342)

Some parts are harder, some parts are easier. The notes mean lots of research before I can write some scenes.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20123295051)

That slows me down a lot. But Mr. Jordan was a master worldbuilder, so—in some ways—it is easier. Hard parts have been done.

For WoT specifically, is it tougher to write the good guys or the bad and why?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20123350031)

In WoT, I'd say the bad guys. We've seen fewer viewpoints from them, so it's tougher to research them, figure them out.

If you could be from any nation in Randland, which one and why?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20185050837)

Malkier, I think. Though others ask me this question, and I think my answer changes. I just think the Malkieri are awesome.
