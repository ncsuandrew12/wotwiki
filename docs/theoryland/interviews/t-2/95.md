# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #95](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#95)

#### [Ty Margheim (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/alSeen14/status/1717146002399232)

Are the prophecies competing a la
*The Belgariad*
(by David Eddings), or are they complementary?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/1719523350675456)

Not competing like
*The Belgariad*
, and certainly not intelligent like in
*The Belgariad*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/1719763088703488)

Some may be interpreted wrong, others may be recorded wrong, but there is not a this/that nature to them.

#### Footnote

The questioner is probably referring to the dark/light prophecies, as this makes the best comparison for Eddings. Brandon is saying that they will all be fulfilled, whether dark or light. (The Seanchan prophecies are another matter altogether, and Brandon was hinting at this in his last tweet; there is good reason to believe that the Seanchan prophecies have been corrupted.)
