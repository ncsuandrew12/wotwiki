Who would you say is your favorite Forsaken? And that's coming from you as a fan more than you as the writer.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19948503321)

Hmm... Ishamael/Moridin.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/19951345935)

Who's second strongest Forsaken after Moridin? Some say Demandred some say Aginor. Did RJ say in his notes?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20105827019)

It IS in the notes, very explicitly. As for your answer...I'll see if we can get that in the Encyclopedia.

#### Footnote

The BWB says that Aginor was second-strongest of the male Forsaken. It also implies that Demandred is somewhat lower on the list than some fans expect, but since the Forsaken are all very close, it probably doesn't make as big a difference as some imagine.
