Is Elan Morin a Dreamer/Dreamwalker?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20953861353)

That's an excellent question. But I don't know if I'm allowed to answer. Remind me again when the deadline is past, and I'll see.

#### Footnote

Brandon indicated later that there is one
[male](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#66)
[Forsaken](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#136)
who is
[a Dreamer](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#3)
, which most likely means Moridin.
