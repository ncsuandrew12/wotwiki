You've been quoted saying Rand and Egwene will get about the same screen time [in
*Towers of Midnight*
] as Mat and Perrin in
*The Gathering Storm*
. Is this the case?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18545897387)

That is correct. Though it might be a tad more. This book will be longer, and a lot of that is some extra Rand/Egwene.
