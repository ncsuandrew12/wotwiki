@FelixPax You post some curious things. Tell me, did anyone ever ask RJ anything about Ila?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20867868519)

Ila is a very mythological name, though. I suspect you are right about its origins.

Though remember, not all of the names are intentionally from mythology. Some just felt right to him, so he chose them.
