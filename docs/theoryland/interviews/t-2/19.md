Should we expect
*Towers of Midnight*
to be as predominantly dark in mood as
*The Gathering Storm*
was?

Well, the Last Battle is close, so things aren't getting brighter. There's a reason Mr. Jordan named the last volume
*A Memory of Light*
.

But won't Rand be a bit more 'light' since the last chapter of
*The Gathering Storm*
?

RAFO. (But chances seem good.)

#### [GIEL VAN SCHIJNDEL](http://twitter.com/muggenhor/status/19069143875)

That being said, will
*Towers of Midnight*
still have its bright moments, like Rand recovering his sanity and will to live at the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
?

There will be those, of course.
