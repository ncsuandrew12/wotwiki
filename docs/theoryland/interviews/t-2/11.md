Re: The Outriggers novels. I've posted about this on my website. Short answer is: It's up to Harriet, but probably not.

Has there been any further discussion of the outriggers between you and Harriet?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (15 JULY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18581063673)

There has not. Just the original "What do you think?" discussion. Basically, we decided to shelve it until
*A Memory of Light*
was done.

I noticed that you mentioned the Outriggers that Mr. Jordan was planning... Are you planning on writing those as well?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (15 JULY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18583185125)

Short answer: Probably not. Longer answer: We'll decide after
*A Memory of Light*
is done, but are hesitant.
