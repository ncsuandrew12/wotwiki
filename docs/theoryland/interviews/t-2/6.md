#### [Austin Moore (7 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/#%21/Southpaw2014/status/17986406532)

You mentioned that something important happened between books 4-6 that people missed.... Can you elaborate anymore on that?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (7 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17988067333)

Only thing I'll say is that I'm sure at least one person has guessed what it has to do with. (They emailed me.)

#### Footnote

Brandon was probably aware that Callandor had
[correctly guessed](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=69985#poststop)
what it had to do with on Theoryland, since Peter likely told him that we had accidentally disqualified it by way of
[misinterpreting his statement](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=70896#poststop)
that we were 'not on the right track'.
