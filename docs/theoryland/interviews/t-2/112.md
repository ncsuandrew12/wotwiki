You said at a book tour that we'd seen Demandred lots already—is this true? Has he been 'on screen' in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

I was being jokey on that one, meaning the times he's appeared as himself or been referenced as himself.

I have not answered if we've seen him 'In disguise' yet. Or I didn't intend to. Might have sounded that way.
