Has anyone personally written to you with an Asmodean's killer theory that was 100% correct?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21136105842)

You know, people don't usually write me with theories. Well, some do—but only the really, really odd ones.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/21182120057)

Can you at least say anything about how us readers could try and figure out Asmodean's murder? Timing, motive, etc?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21303288502)

The thing is, people have already discussed this to death. They've found the clues, they've got the right rationale.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21303302555)

The question is WHICH clues and WHICH rationale are you going to believe.
