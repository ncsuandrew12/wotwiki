Are there actually Warders and Aes Sedai guarding the Blight at all times? Or is that another TEOTWism?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20922389730)

Well, there are Aes Sedai and Warders staying with most Borderlander monarchs.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20922417355)

I would say that yes, they are up there guarding. There are a disproportionate number, it seems, at times.

Morgase had one Aes Sedai, as did Berelain, to give advice. Borderlanders often have more.

#### Footnote

In the prologue of
*The Path of Daggers*
, 'Deceptive Appearances', it is made relatively clear that Paitar, Ethenielle, and Easar only had one advisor each.
