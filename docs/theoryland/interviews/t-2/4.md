Blast. Where did I put my copy of New Spring? (Grumbles and goes up to search his library.)

Found it. You know, I like
*New Spring*
, but I really don't think people should start with it. It reveals too much about Moiraine and Lan.

In response to questions, I'm thinking
*New Spring*
is best read after Book Four. That's a good place to gain context on Moiraine.
