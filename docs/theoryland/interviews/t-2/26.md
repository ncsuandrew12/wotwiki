Are you going to point all the hints out in more detail after
*A Memory of Light*
? Or am I being a lazy fan now? :P

I will be much more free of tongue then.

When WoT series is finished, will you feel more inclined to share WoT details that didn't make it to the books?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19948249912)

Yes, I will.
