# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #45](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#45)

#### [Austin Moore (9 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/20742190033)

Have you seen any theories online about the ending of WoT that were right?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/20753743084)

Yes, I have.

#### Footnote

Of course, 'the ending' is a rather broad category that could include anything at all about the Last Battle, Rand's death/resurrection, Shayol Ghul, the sealing of the Bore, etc.
