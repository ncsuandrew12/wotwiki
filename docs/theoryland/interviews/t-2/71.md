Do you think
*Towers of Midnight*
is better than
*The Gathering Storm*
, A: as an author, B: as a fan? WoT fans will buy it regardless...

I'll have to think about that one more. They are very different books. It's like comparing Book 4 and Book 1.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21142575595)

Both are strong. But they do different things. One is focused, the other has more scope. But both are good books.
