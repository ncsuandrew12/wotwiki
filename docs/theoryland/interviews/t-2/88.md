# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #88](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#88)

#### [Kozza Bambuda (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/kozza/status/1711498577584128)

Is there specific reason for the WoT team's and your seeming reluctance to possibly pursuing outrigger novels?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/1713874956984320)

Because we don't want to exploit Robert Jordan's name. Doing books he told us to do is one thing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/1713973225324544)

Doing more is troubling. There's nothing wrong with Outriggers; I'm not worried about them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/1714090892333056)

I'm worried that it will be harder to stop after doing them, and I feel it WOULD be wrong not to stop then.

#### [DAVID IMBEAULT](http://twitter.com/CynanMachae/status/1714489858719745)

Any plans for the other WoT prequels?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/1717845666824193)

As of right now, no plans. We are hesitant because we don't want to exploit RJ's legacy.
