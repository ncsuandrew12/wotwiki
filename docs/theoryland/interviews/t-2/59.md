Can you tell us if
*Towers of Midnight*
will include any new maps of cities?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20946766004)

Yes.

#### [SAM NYE](http://twitter.com/quantum_grid/status/20947332542)

Cool! Any chance you can tell us which one? ;-)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20954430249)

That would end the speculation. ;)
