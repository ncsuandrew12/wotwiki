Did you consult Maria before deciding Egwene shall attempt to fall fleeing
*raken*
? Would she be able to do so Bounded?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19886920173)

I'm a little confused at what you're asking. Do you mean "Fell?" And what do you mean by Bounded?

#### [yoniy0](http://twitter.com/yoniy0/status/19903105724)

Sorry. There has been some discussion around the Third Oath and Egwene attacking retreating
*raken*
...

#### [yoniy0](http://twitter.com/yoniy0/status/19903121176)

I was asking if you think she could have done the same now, after taking the Oaths (and whether you asked Maria to weigh in).

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19948035005)

We did talk about this. I think it's iffy. Depends on Egwene's mindset. I don't think most Aes Sedai could have done it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19948058368)

In fact, it's good her circle was with those who hadn't taken the Oaths yet...

I think Yoniy0 meant 'would Egwene be able to kill (fell) fleeing
*to'raken*
were she bound by the Oaths?'

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19946505925)

I don't know that she would have been able to. Depends. The Oaths depend on how you view what you're doing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19946539445)

Elaida got around them (or to the side of them) by convincing herself Egwene was a Darkfriend.
