Due to the prologue split, is most of the
*Towers of Midnight*
prologue chronologically before most events in
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21032087221)

A good chunk is. But it depends on which pieces of
*The Gathering Storm*
you're talking about...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/21032916867)

Thanks! I figured, before everything but the prologue and earliest bits of
*The Gathering Storm*
, except maybe the scenes you added for
*Towers of Midnight*
?

Can't say more on the prologue. But you're on the right track.
