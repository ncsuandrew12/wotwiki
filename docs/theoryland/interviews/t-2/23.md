# [Interview #2: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT), Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#23)

#### [Mick Wick (28 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/DirektorDoom/status/19723373448)

Is it possible for us readers to figure out Demandred's identity with the information we already have?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 July 2010 (Facebook))](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/129638540412526)

And now, Theoryland is holding its breath. I think I might have actually answered on tour. I'm not sure what RJ said on the matter, but...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19775664077)

I will say only this: There ARE clues. I think it could be figured out. Maybe. It's much, much harder than Asmodean's killer.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/19775812800)

Obviously, I must be tight-lipped. Can it be figured out: Yes. Will it make you smack your heads & say "I should have seen it!" Probably not.

(from the Facebook comments on Brandon's first tweet)

#### RICHELLE PERRAULT

Brandon, you are such a tease........ but I will "RAFO". but still it's a tease.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Sorry. Inherited that from RJ. Still, it wasn't totally a RAFO. It was a tad more than that. I do see from Tamyrlin's post that RJ confirmed that you could figure it out.

#### TEREZ

Sort of. There was room in RJ's comment for the interpretation that we should be able to figure out that Demandred is simply Demandred. You have made it more clear. Not that we are complaining.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Ah, I see. Well, let me add the official clarification onto what I've said: Basically, I'm not merely talking about "Alter Ego" here when I reply to the "Figure out Demandred's Identity" question. I look at that question as a larger "What he's been up to, what he's been influencing, where he's hiding" that sort of thing.

Why make this distinction? Well, it's because of things that (likely) others have figured out already. Demandred hasn't been in-guise in the books at least up to
*Knife of Dreams*
. So energies focused on "exactly who is he" would be pointless, to an extent. If he is indeed imitating someone, you haven't seen that someone through most of the series. At least not in person. You may have seen them now, but if so, they haven't been on-screen for long.

So, what I'm saying is basically this: There are clues as to what Demandred is up to. You could figure that out. I think it would be hard, but not so hard that someone won't guess it. (And, knowing WoT fandom, someone probably has.)

#### Footnote

Brandon later
[verified](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#21)
that Demandred does indeed have an alter ego.
