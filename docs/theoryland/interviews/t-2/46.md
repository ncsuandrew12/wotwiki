One of Tuon's Conflicts, is will she 'protect' the Tinkers from harm and keep her word? Or is Tuon loyal to the
*a'dam*
?

Tuon is loyal, so far, to the
*a'dam*
. In her mind, leashing Tinkers who could channel would be 'protecting' them.

Now, how that might change based on interactions with Aes Sedai—and the true secret of
*sul'dam*
—is still uncertain.
