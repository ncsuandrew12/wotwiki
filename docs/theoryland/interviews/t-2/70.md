# [Interview #2, Entry #70]: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#70)

Compared to the
*A Memory of Light*
note content and detail how much was left for the remaining two prequels? Were they as detailed?

There are lots of notes for everything. But RJ did not leave any scenes written, which is a big difference.

Will you ever give us annotations for WoT like you did for your other books? Or would Harriet & Co. say no?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 August)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21129944140)

This isn't likely to happen, as I don't think Harriet would want me to do it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21129965755)

However, a book length work of annotations plus some of Mr. Jordan's notes might be possible. It will be up to Harriet.
