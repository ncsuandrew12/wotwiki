Noal Charin: was he drawn to Mat by the pull of a
*ta'veren*
, or was there something of a "Hero to Hornsounder" pull as well?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21312770350)

You're making assumptions about Noal that have not been clarified in the text. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21312835096)

On a more serious note, total RAFO on whether Jain is/was/will be a Hero. It's been talked about for years and years.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21314639712)

And I suspect that it will continue to be a source of discussion for some time. ;)

#### [HBFFERREIRA](http://twitter.com/HBFFerreira/status/21340586722)

Well, it's such a common assumption that I didn't even realize it hadn't been stated as true yet. :-p

#### [HBFFERREIRA](http://twitter.com/HBFFerreira/status/21340671255)

But while I'm assuming, I take it that Noal's past may be one of those things Robert Jordan didn't intend to reveal. :-p

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (17 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/21381775488)

RAFO on what RJ would or wouldn't reveal. :)

I wonder "when" will Farstrider's real background be exposed to Mat, Thom?

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/21330355701)

At least four people should know who Farstrider really is: Loial, Elder Haman, Elder Arent, and Speaker Covril.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/21330479666)

Two other characters might know who Farstrider really is too: Birgitte from Ebou Dar, and Luca from Shangtai.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/21330836436)

Obviously a bunch of other older characters have a chance of recognizing Noal as Farstrider in Caemlyn too.

Continues whistling and walking the other direction.
