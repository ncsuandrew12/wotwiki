Okay, time to post about Cyndane for you Theorylanders. I have been discussing with Maria all day. She and I have different opinions on...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/182376924556)

...some things in the notes, but she has convinced me that she is right. I believed that there were some...issues with her power level.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/181862048105)

Dark One playing tricks to keep everyone guessing. But Maria convinced me her Power really is what it seems. So you can disregard my...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/183871851329)

...comment about her being really really weak and stick with the word I used earlier: "weakened."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/183347160177)

This is what you get for asking about things that we are still picking apart the notes regarding.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn/posts/176163157905)

;) You know I love you, Theorylanders. (Even if I sometimes feel like I'm surrounded by a pack of wolves when talking to you.)

#### Footnote

Brandon had indicated in
*The Gathering Storm*
signing reports that Cyndane was 'much weaker' than Lanfear. However, Graendal indicated in
*The Path of Daggers*
that Cyndane was, while weaker than Lanfear, still stronger than her, so we knew she wasn't
*that*
much weaker. It's still up in the air after
*Towers of Midnight*
as to why she wasn't drained as much as Moiraine. The Eelfinn claimed that they killed her by draining her too quickly, but Moiraine thinks that someone came for her. Anyway, we badgered Brandon about it, so he cleared up the confusion.
