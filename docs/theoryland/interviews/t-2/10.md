# [Interview #2, Entry #10]: Twitter 2009-2010 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#10)

#### [Shivam Bhatt (14 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/18544686693)

Out of curiosity, do you have a list of the sundry unsolved mysteries in the books? Or untied threads and references?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18547840522)

Yes, I do. And, I even have a list of ones Mr. Jordan was planning not to answer or reveal.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18547962871)

Mr. Jordan listed some mysteries in the notes that are NOT to be solved. Perhaps you should try to guess which ones.

#### [dopwensj](http://twitter.com/dpowensj/status/18548051430)

Are they not explained, or are they explicitly noted to refrain from releasing the solution?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18548470264)

Some of each. There's one that I really wish I knew, but he didn't tell anyone, and said no answer is to be given.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18549042551)

As for the mysteries, there are indeed some that Mr. Jordan did not reveal in the notes. All he said was: "This is not revealed."

#### [Kyle Litka](http://twitter.com/kylelitke/status/18548359494)

A lot of mysteries or just a few? And any major ones (without going into specifics, I know you can't)?

#### [Brandon SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18550121422)

No major ones, in my opinion, except for a couple of unresolved plot threads he had been saving for the Outriggers.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18551514335)

I can't say much more about mysteries. I've said before that all major plotlines have resolution. Unresolved things are smaller.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18580223336)

If I have my way, the notes Mr. Jordan [left] will be printed after the series is done. At least in part.

#### [Greuvy](http://twitter.com/gruevy/status/18549140240)

Are the unanswered mysteries at least interesting, or are they like, "who made the baked ham in book 4!"?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18580243178)

Some are very interesting to me.

#### [4th Age](http://twitter.com/4thAge/status/18549168524)

Are there also some that ARE revealed in the notes, but have an added "but this doesn't go into the books."?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18580270719)

Yes, there are, at least in implication. Many of these have to do with things I think he was reserving for the Outriggers.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18580301893)

Yes, I will push for that to be in the notes we release, if the Outriggers aren't written.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 July)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18663566807)

I'm afraid I'm not allowed to show any of the notes right now. Maybe after
*A Memory of Light*
. Some may go in the encyclopedia Harriet is doing.

#### [Callandor (17 July)](http://twitter.com/StellarPulse/status/18812541515)

Is the identity of
[who ordered the attack on Demira Eriff](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#11)
a mystery with an answer? My money is on Taim but surprises are fun.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (19 July)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/18945887281)

I'm not going to say which ones. But it's good to hear what people are curious about.
