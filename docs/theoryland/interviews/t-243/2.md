# [Interview #243, Entry #2]: KOD Signing Report - Hermano de lobos](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=243#2)

#### Hermano de lobos

But one person asked something to the effect of: How valid are the viewings and prophecies, given that the Pattern has been loosened? There was also a comment by the person about how the viewings and prophecies are readings of the Pattern.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan responded, (not word for word) The viewings and prophecies that occurred before the loosening of the Pattern are very valid. But those that occurred at, or after, the loosening have a higher chance of not coming true.

#### Hermano de lobos

I thought this was pretty big news. I don't have the best memory in the world, so my wording may be a little off. Feel free to correct me if you were there.
