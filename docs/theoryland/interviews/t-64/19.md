#### Robert Jordan

Fel was killed because somebody thought he might reveal too much.

#### Footnote

Dom from Wotmania, etc. believes that Sammael (who is known to have controlled the
*gholam*
, which is known to have killed Fel from the
*Lord of Chaos*
epilogue) had Fel killed because he did not believe Asmodean was dead, and thought Fel was Asmodean in disguise.
