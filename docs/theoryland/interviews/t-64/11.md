# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#11)

#### Robert Jordan

Background: I asked him how much of the setting, etc. was worked out before hand, and how much he does as he goes along. He said that he has a 10pp or so history of all the countries/regions, and societies. When the plot goes into a region, he fleshes out the outline.
