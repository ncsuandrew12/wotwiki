# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#3)

#### Pam Korda

Hawk found a way to get RJ's attention. Brandish a whip. You see, RJ IS a dirty old man.

That was it for Saturday. On Sunday was the reading. He read a piece from
*A Crown of Swords*
. (I'll put it in a separate post, to avoid spoiling anybody even a bit. It wasn't a very plot-intensive bit, though. Fewer spoilers than the Prologue has!) It was a Mat bit. After the reading, he talked about Mat as a character a bit.

#### Robert Jordan

Anyway, Mat has indeed had far and away more MPS experience than our other young heroes, and intends to get much much more. I believe the quote was something like "The world is full of beautiful women, and Mat wants to romp barefoot though them all. (or was that with them all. same thing.) He's slept with lots of women; he's slept with women old enough to be his mother..."

Also, Mat makes the Aes Sedai nervous.

Sigh, and if RJ had shown all of this "on-screen," y'all wouldn't be complaining about the lack of explicit sex in TWOT!!! (And the books would read like
*The Fallon Blood*
.)
