# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#1)

#### Pam Korda

Here is a summary of What RJ said at the Baltimore Con this weekend. I haven't got time to write a long summary of everything that went on; I will leave the discussion of the social aspects (and anything that happened Friday) to Bill and Robyn... I'll leave the discussion on vegetarianism to Bill and Robyn, too.

#### Robert Jordan

We went to RJ's Guest of Honor speech on Saturday, he talked about the importance of literacy, nothing about the Wheel of Time. Bill, Hawk and I assaulted him afterwards and asked a few questions, or, rather, listened to him talk to other folks.
