# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#2)

#### Robert Jordan

He says that unabridged books-on-tape production of
*The Eye of the World*
and
*A Crown of Swords*
are forthcoming. When, I dunno; I got the impression it was still a rather nebulous plan, but Tor (or whoever)
*has*
agreed to do them. The two mentioned above will be the first released, and the intermediary books will come out on tape in due course. The idea is to get a woman to read the parts which are in a woman's POV and a man to read the parts in a man's POV. Marina Sirtis of Star Trek fame, and Ben Kingsley were mentioned as possible readers.

#### Footnote

All of the Wheel of Time audiobooks are read by
