# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#8)

#### Question

When did Mat die and live again?

#### Robert Jordan

He said something that implied that the die and live again prophecy-fulfillment was the lightning incident in
*The Fires of Heaven*
, and not the hanging incident in
*The Shadow Rising*
. I was always sure it was the other way around. To paraphrase the Humblest Man on the Net: Who's this guy to tell me such things? He just wrote the books.
