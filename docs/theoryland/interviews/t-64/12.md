#### Robert Jordan

The Guide to the Wheel of Time: Out sometime this year, I think. Art by Todd Hamiltonâ€”anybody know if this guy has done anything we'd recognize? At least it isn't DKS! Stuff that will be in there: History of Artur Hawkwing, History of the Post-Breaking Aes Sedai, the Seanchan, the Aiel War and the final battle outside Tar Valon.
