Elaida and her Foretelling: Most Foretellers' Foretellings are very vague and poetic-sounding, making it difficult to tell what, actually, WAS foretold before it actually happens. Elaida, on the other hand, has very clear, definite Foretellings. She says stuff like "John will die"â€”not much vagueness about that. (Of course, Elaida often misinterprets it.)
