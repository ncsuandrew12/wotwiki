# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#4)

#### Question

Some dude asked if Perrin's hawk had appeared yet.

#### Robert Jordan

The answer: "I thought that was fairly obvious. What is the symbol of Mayene? What is the CROWN of Mayene?" i.e. Berelain, for all of you who actually doubted that. RJ also said Berelain is attracted to Perrin partly because he's the first man she wanted and couldn't get which is interesting, partly because he's buff, and partly because she thinks it'd be kinky to make it with a blacksmith. (On the anvil???)
