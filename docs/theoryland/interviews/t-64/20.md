# [Interview #64: BaltiCon XXX - Pam Korda, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#20)

#### Robert Jordan

Verin: Considerably older than anyone expects. (I presume he was talking about the characters, not the fans, considering that our guesses range up to 3000 years old.) He also said that Age of Legends lifespans are not known in modern Randland. (Thus, I presume that Verin is NOT 300 years old.) He said something about "the effects of the Oath Rod," I don't know whether this was with reference to aging, or effects on something totally unrelated.

Well, that's that.

â€”Pam
