# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#12)

#### Br00se

The next question was concerning other projects he was working on.

#### Robert Jordan

His reply was that he wasn't working on any other projects, and that he can only work on one project at a time. When he was working on the Guide and
*New Spring*
, he had to stop working on the novel during that time.

I missed the next question, but it was something about his computer use. He said that whenever he was at his computer, he was writing. Apart from checking his E-mail and updating his virus definitions files, about all he did on his computer was write.
