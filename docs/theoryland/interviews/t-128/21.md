# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#21)

#### Br00se

Some one asked him if he was going to DragonCon in Atlanta.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that he had been told that he received an invitation. He didn't say if he would go or not.

#### BR00SE

The next question was about his favorite authors, he rattled off a long list, most of which have already been listed elsewhere. If anyone really wants to know, I'll go through the tape again and see what I can recover.

#### Footnote

RJ didn't go to DragonCon again until 2005.
