This is the long version of a post I made last week. Very little, if anything is new, but I wanted to post it all for the sake of being complete.

Robert Jordan Book signing for Winter's Heart
  
December 5, 2000. — Atlanta, GA. — Chapter 11 bookstore.

The signing started at 7:00pm. I was late however, arriving around 7:30. I took several pictures and brought along a borrowed tape recorder. It didn't pick up everything that was said, but after running the tape through the EQ, I got a good bit from it. I usually had a harder time getting the questions since those asking the questions had their backs to me. Here is what I was able to collect; much of this has been reported on a number of times.
