# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#1)

#### Br00se

I just got home from the Atlanta signing. I had planed to ask several questions, but I mostly wimped out.

I borrowed a tape recorder from a friend of mine who is a reporter. I figured he would have a good one. However, I think I now understand why people get misquoted so often. Based on a sample playback, I don't expect to get much out of it.

Due to some poor instructions from MapQuest, and my own inability to drive and navigate, I arrived at the signing 30 minutes late (at 7:30) even though I left in time to get there about 45 minutes early. I hate Atlanta traffic. If he made any opening remarks, I missed them. I stood around and listened to other people's questions and comments with my tape recorder in hand while I made my buddy go wait in line for the signing.

While I heard very little that was new, there were a few tidbits.
