# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#38)

#### Br00se

The signing was finished by the point with only a few people wandering in late to get some signed. He signed some store stock copies, and chatted a little bit more.

#### Robert Jordan

He told a few more stories from other signings. He explained that there was overlapping periods from the last two books and would be for the next one as well. When he said something about the next two signing dates in Columbia, SC and in Charleston, SC, I told him that the Tor website didn't have them listed. He seemed a little concerned about that. He told the story about getting his hat in Montana. And about how the current one was a replacement for one that walked away from for a signing.
