# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#31)

#### Br00se

The next question was by Daniel Rouk I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. I've posted this part before, but included it for completeness.

#### QUESTION

How do you keep track of all the information? Do you have, like, a database?

#### Robert Jordan

I have a database. Yes. I have a database, in a way a rather rudimentary one. It is simply a huge collection of files organized on characters, on cultures, um (pause) organizations, anything that I think I might need to know about the world. But to tell you the truth, I usually go into those files to add in new things that I've come up with. It's not that often that I go in there to check on things.

#### QUESTION

Do you keep a list of all your different threads so you don't have a whole bunch of hanging.....

#### ROBERT JORDAN

No, no, no, no, no, no that's all in my head. It doesn't exist anywhere except in my head.

#### QUESTION

Thanks.
