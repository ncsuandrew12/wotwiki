# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#17)

#### Br00se

The next question dealt with him designing cultures.

#### Robert Jordan

He gave a familiar answer about how he started by saying if one thing is true about the people, he would ask what three other things must be true. He then repeats this until he is satisfied that he has enough to work with. He used the Aiel as an example, starting with them living in a dry wasteland, what else must be true.
