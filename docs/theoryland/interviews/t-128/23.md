# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#23)

#### Br00se

Someone asked about the cover art.

#### Robert Jordan

He described the process as working something like this: He writes a description of what he wants for the artist. The artist then makes a sketch of how it will look. RJ then makes comments and corrections and sends that back. He doesn't see it again until it is finished and ready for publication.
