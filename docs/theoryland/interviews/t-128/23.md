#### Br00se

Someone asked about the cover art.

#### Robert Jordan

He described the process as working something like this: He writes a description of what he wants for the artist. The artist then makes a sketch of how it will look. RJ then makes comments and corrections and sends that back. He doesn't see it again until it is finished and ready for publication.
