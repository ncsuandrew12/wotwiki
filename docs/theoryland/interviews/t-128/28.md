# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#28)

#### Br00se

The next lady asked some question about one of Min's viewing of Rand with three women. She was confused because Min didn't recognize someone in the viewing that she should have known.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ had to repeat three or four times that the viewing wasn't clear at the time. He seemed to be stressing that Min's inability to recognize the person didn't mean anything important. Her viewings don't always tell everything. This is only important because it means that you can't use anything that was missing from Min's viewings as proof of anything.
