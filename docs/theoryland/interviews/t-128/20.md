# [Interview #128, Entry #20]: WH Signing Report - Br00se](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#20)

#### Br00se

The next person asked about the WOT computer action game.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that the game designers did a fine job with it, but didn't get everything he wanted in there. This is mostly because of the limitations of the Unreal engine. His role in creating it was pretty limited because he was writing a book at the time.

Something came up about Wizards of the Coast. He said that they were working on an online WOT game. If he gave more details, I missed them.
