# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#11)

#### Br00se

The first question I heard was concerning his favorite character.

#### Robert Jordan

His reply was whomever he was writing at the time. He then went on to say that his wife could guess whom he had been writing just by looking at him. I missed the next question, but the answer was: "Don't name your son Chad."

#### Footnote

This comment no doubt had something to do with the infamous
[2000 US presidential election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000)
(
*Bush v. Gore*
), the results of which (thanks to Florida's ambiguous 'hanging chad' ballots) were not officially and finally declared until December 12, one week after this signing (despite the election having occurred on November 7).
