# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#3)

#### Robert Jordan

Someone asked about the populations of the major cities. After a little clarifications, he basically said that Tar Valon has a population of about 700,000 and the several of the other cities have around 500,000. He gave a number for the total population of Andor, but I'm not sure of the number, and hope that made it to the tape I'm going to analyze tomorrow.
