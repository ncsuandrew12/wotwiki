# [Interview #128, Entry #35]: WH Signing Report - Br00se](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#35)

#### Robert Jordan

He explained that the host bookstore sets the rules for the signing and he follows the rules. He told a story of when he was doing a signing where they allowed only two items per trip through the line, after that you had to get back to the end. When the last fellow came to the table and had four books. Jordan signed two and said that he couldn't sign the other two until he went to the back of the line. The guy said, "But, I'm the last one." Jordan said, "I don't make the rules I just follow them." The guy stood then for a second then walked in a circle and came back to the table where Jordan promptly signed his other two books.

He then told a story about some neighbors of his which I didn't transcribe. It had something to do with his soul and the number of times he's leased it out.
