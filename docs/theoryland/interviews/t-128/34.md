# [Interview #128: WH Signing Report - Br00se, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=128#34)

#### Robert Jordan

The next question was about the tying up of all threads, to which he said it was not going to happen. He then told how he didn't like it when in most books all the sub plots are tied up and that you could put the world in a bell jar and put it on a shelf. He wants his reads to imagine his world still living after the series is finished. He said that he was going to set a hook at the end of the last book and walk away.

He again stated that he only worked on one book at a time.
