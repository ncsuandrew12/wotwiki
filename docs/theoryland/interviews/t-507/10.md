# [Interview #507: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#10)

#### Richard Fife

I also noticed that, in the reading from
*The Way of Kings*
last night, he definitely has picked up Jordanâ€™s flair for description.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Yes, it is very good. He is different from Robert Jordan, but he is launching on a career that will resemble Jordan's. I feel extra lucky that I got him to work on The Wheel of Time when I did, because as you can tell from his books, Brandon has his own huge trajectory.

#### Richard Fife

Indeed, after all, he has said the
*Stormlight Archive*
will be ten novels from the get-go.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Yes, but it is not just quantity, but quality. He has wonderful world-building.
