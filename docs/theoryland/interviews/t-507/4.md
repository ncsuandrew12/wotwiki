# [Interview #507, Entry #4]: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#4)

#### Richard Fife

In a standard author-editor relationship, you would typically get the manuscript in a whole piece. I am guessing this was not the case with you and Jim?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

That would be correct. He would bring in a chapter or two in the evening, and we'd have supper, and the next day I'd edit that, and plunk it down on the table and wait for the next chapter. It is called "curb-side editing," but that is how it had to work. And if there was something really dire, I would tell him. One time, I told him "We have three chapters here of talking heads. Can we have some action?" So somebody gets murdered in those chapters. And I'm not going to tell you who, and it was not Asmodean.
