# [Interview #507, Entry #9]: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#9)

#### Richard Fife

Brandon often says that Jordan was one of his biggest muses for why he even started writing. Can you see that in his writing?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, Brandon has said that he decided to have his own books confined in a city because he could not possibly do the "galloping over the landscape" thing as well as Robert Jordan, that he was defining himself in terms of Jordan's epic fantasy, if that makes sense.

#### Richard Fife

Yeah, he was trying to find his own voice.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Yes, yes, and he's got some good haring across the landscape stuff in his book.
