# [Interview #507: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#1)

#### Richard Fife

So, as I said in the
[recap post](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/04/recap-of-jordancon-ii-aka-the-sean-con-invasion)
, I got a whole slew of interviews while at JordanCon, lost them, then got them again. To that effect, I want to thank Harriet not just for her time once, but twice. Now, without further fluff, my interview with Harriet McDougal, editor of The Wheel of Time and widow of James Oliver Rigney Jr., better known as Robert Jordan.
