# [Interview #507: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#6)

#### Richard Fife

Did you feel like he ever had trouble writing strong female characters, or had to struggle with it?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

No, he was a natural. He liked to say, "The women in my family are strong women, and the men are strong because the women killed and ate the weak ones." Well, he did say that. It wasn't true. I never saw any bones, anyway.
