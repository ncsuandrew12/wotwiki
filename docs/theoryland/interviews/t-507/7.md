# [Interview #507: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#7)

#### Richard Fife

Let's talk about Brandon Sanderson a little bit. You have been working very closely with him for a few years now.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Yes, and he is wonderful.

#### Richard Fife

Was there any sort of adjustment period to getting used to working with his work style versus Jim's?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, there was an adjustment period for both of us. I had not been his editor before, and when he first sent in material, I was unable to deal with it. I was still too lost in grief. I just couldn't deal for two months or so, and Brandon was just great and said, "Harriet, was this very, very hard for you?" And I said, "Yes." I mean, he's just a lovely, super person. It is a pleasure to work with him. He is not just a pro and one heck of a storyteller, but just so nice. It has been better than I could have ever expected, working with him.
