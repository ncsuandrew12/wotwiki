What was the biggest challenge of being your husband's editor?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

As we got into The Wheel of Time, the biggest challenge was that we were always behind the eight ball as far as delivery dates to New York went. That was one of the biggest challenges, keeping the pressure off of him, and dealing with it myself and getting my work done in double time.

The other biggest challenge was keeping Tom Doherty from making editorial suggestions to Jim, because every time he did that, poor Jim would be stopped dead in his tracks. He'd lose about a month while he was brooding about that. So eventually, I told Tom, "Just don't, unless you want another late book." And Tom was very good about it once I explained the problem to him, I think. I don't know why it was so difficult for Jim to accept that from Tom, but it was.
