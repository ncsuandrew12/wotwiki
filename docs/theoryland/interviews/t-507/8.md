# [Interview #507: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#8)

#### Richard Fife

So you have done a single pass-through of line-editing on his upcoming novel,
*The Way of Kings*
. What was the difference in working on something that was solely Brandon Sanderson verse working on the Wheel?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The characters of The Wheel of Time, I have known since they first came into being, for many of them twenty years. I know how they talk, so I'm much bitchier about them, and will say, "NO! This is not Aviendha! Try again!" And he did, and he got her. But these are his people, so it is different. I don't say, "I donâ€™t like this character," because it is his character and his world.
