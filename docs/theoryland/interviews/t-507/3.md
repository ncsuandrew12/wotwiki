# [Interview #507: JordanCon: Interview with Harriet McDougal by Richard Fife, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=507#3)

#### Richard Fife

Did you ever feel any conflict between the husband-wife relationship and the editor-author one?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

No. No, I didn't. I respected his work as a writer from the very beginning, and he respected my work as an editor. And if we had disagreements—we had them—the sun didn't go down on them.
