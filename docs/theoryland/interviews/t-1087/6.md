# [Interview #1087: Brandon Sanderson Interview, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1087#6)

#### Jean Marie Ward

I was especially intrigued by Alcatraz's super power. I have to ask, was the super power of being able to break anything based on your own kids?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't have kids when I wrote
*Alcatraz versus The Evil Librarians*
. It's more based on my mother who was really not that great with electronics and seems to be able to mess things up in a really bizarre and interesting way a lot of the time. Though, being late to things, which is Grandpa Smedry's super power, heâ€™s magically late to appointments. That's based on me. I'm pretty good at being late.
