#### Jean Marie Ward

Very cool. Is there anything you'd like to add?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, sorry. Unless you want to mention people could find a free book of mine on my website,
*Warbreaker*
, for download. You can just give it a read and see if you enjoy my work or not.

#### Jean Marie Ward

Thatâ€™s wonderful. I will be mentioning your website in the credits.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you.

#### Jean Marie Ward

Thank you so much, Brandon. And thank you for BuzzyMag.com.
