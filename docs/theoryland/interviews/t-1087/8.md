# [Interview #1087: Brandon Sanderson Interview, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1087#8)

#### Jean Marie Ward

The Stormlight Archive is, I believe, your big project at the moment. . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is.

#### Jean Marie Ward

. . . the dominating project. Could you give our viewers a hint of what to expect in
*Words of Radiance*
, and also the next books in the series, not spoilery, just a hint, and then tell them some of the other projects you may be working on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that what to expect, hopefully lots of awesomeness. It's so hard to explain what to expect. Solid world-building. . .

#### Jean Marie Ward

Your trademark magic.

#### Brandon Sanderson

. . . great characters, magic systems. It is the story of Teton people and their backstories, how they become who they are and whether they fail or succeed. I don't know what to tell you to expect other than I hope more of the same.

What am I working on right now? I am just most recently finished
*Firefight*
, the sequel to
*Steelheart*
, which was my teen release from last year. I'm currently working on the sequel to
*Rithmatist*
, which hopefully both will come out next year some time.
