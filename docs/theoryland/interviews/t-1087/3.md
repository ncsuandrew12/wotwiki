#### Jean Marie Ward

Are you going through the five stages of grief?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know. I had such a long time to prepare for it. It's not like getting hit with the five stages of grief in the same way, since I knew this was only going to be a short thing. But there is a sense of regret. At the same time, being able to write the Stormlight Archive is awesome.

I had been planning this series for many years and being able to share with people these stories that I've wanted to tell for such a long time is very gratifying.
*Words of Radiance*
, the second book, this has scenes in it that I initially sketched out to write some eight, nine years ago that I'd been planning.

They came out just as I'd been planning them and it was really exciting that people can now read those.
