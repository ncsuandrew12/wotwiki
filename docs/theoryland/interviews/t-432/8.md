# [Interview #432: Geekerati Radio - Brandon Sanderson Talks Fantasy, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=432#8)

#### Brandon Sanderson

How much time do we have left? I don't even know what time it is.

#### CHRISTIAN LINDKE

Well, we are in what we normally call the after-show; we've gone beyond the hour, but we have some allotted time. From my perspective, and I'm the host number, I'm running slim on time because it's getting to be my daughter's bedtime, but I do believe the show will continue without me. That's been the case in the past, has it not Bill?

#### BILL CUNNINGHAM

I believe so, yeah.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Um...

#### CHRISTIAN LINDKE

So, we have a two-hour block allotted that we
*can*
record, and if you—I mean, obviously I'm not saying "stay here for two hours"—but if you have further things that you want to say and run on even beyond my personal availability in talking with Bill and Eric, you do have that time.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Okay. I have time. I will need to get going fairly soon, but I've got time for a few more questions.

#### CHRISTIAN LINDKE

Well, how about we just finish with one question.
