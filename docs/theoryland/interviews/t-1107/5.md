Are there radiant orders that would take someone like Adolin even after what he does at the end of Words of Radiant?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/6583-adolin-shardblades-skybreakers-wob-seattle-new-info-wor-spoilers-elantris-spoliers/)

Brandon: I am not going to say whether or not Adolin will become a Knights Radiant, but yes, there are several orders that would be very happy with what he did.
Me: Like the Skybreakers or Dustbringers?
Brandon: The Skybreakers would probably not want him because he broke a law, but there are other orders that would think he completely did the right thing and be very happy with him.
Trickonometry (who was waiting in line behind me): Like the Dustbringers?
Brandon: (Didn't say anything but looked up at him, smiled and half nodded)

#### Footnote

This question refers to Adolin's slaying of Sadeas.
