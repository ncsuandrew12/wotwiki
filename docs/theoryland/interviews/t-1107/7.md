Would you be able to tell me anything about how Vasher lost Nightblood to Nin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A: (Brandon gives a knowing smile) "Wait, who?"
Q: Okay... What can you tell me about how Zahel lost Nightblood?
A: Oh ZAHEL! Well... I can't say much about that right now, but you'll get all of these questions answered in the book "Nightblood" in the future.
