#### AhoyMatey

Are the Parshendi at the village the only Parshendi there are? Besides the parshmen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Parshendi as a people were all at Narak. Barring any scouts and things like that. That doesn't mean that there might not be any other Parshmen out there that have bonded spren, but they would not have been part of this nation â€“ any more than if you found another human that they may not necessarily be American.
