#### [Jerich (17th Shard)](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/6583-adolin-shardblades-skybreakers-wob-seattle-new-info-wor-spoilers-elantris-spoliers/)

Is the Hoed from Elantris similar to the state of a shard blade?

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/6583-adolin-shardblades-skybreakers-wob-seattle-new-info-wor-spoilers-elantris-spoliers/)

(slightly paraphrased, because I am writing these from memory): Similar, but probably not exactly in the way you are thinking. It is kind of like two diseases caused by different bacteria. Both are caused by bacteria, but they are not exactly the same.

#### Footnote

This is referring to shardblades that are dead spren.
