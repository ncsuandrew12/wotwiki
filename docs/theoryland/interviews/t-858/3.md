# [Interview #858: The Robert Jordan Story, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=858#3)

#### Harriet McDougal

I've edited every single one of his books except for his
*Cheyenne Raiders*
. An agent said to me once, "What if he gave you a real piece of [crap]?" And I said, "But he never would!" Tom Doherty called me; he had gotten the rights to do a Conan the Barbarian novel. And I said, "Well, Jim could do it." And he liked doing it so much, he ended up writing seven of them.

#### Tom Doherty

He was using a new name. As you know, Jim used pen names.

#### Narrator

Over the next decade, Rigney wrote under many pen names: Jackson O'Reilly, Reagan O'Neal, and of course, Robert Jordan.

#### Harriet McDougal

J.O.R.â€”That was his initials, and I guess the rest just grew because, the way his mind worked, he'd be working on current stuff, but on the back burner, things were cooking away.

#### Tom Doherty

Jim said that he had just dreamed to write a big fantasy.

#### Harriet McDougal

He said his first thought was just, how would it be to be told that you are going to be the savior of the world, but you're going to go mad and kill everyone you love in the process?

#### Tom Doherty

We bought the book in the mid-80s.

#### Harriet McDougal

It was four years of actual work, with words on paper, before he finished
*The Eye of the World*
.

#### Tom Doherty

God, I fell in love with it. I read it, you know, and I said, you know, boy, this is big. This is the first thing I thought could sell like Tolkien.

#### Harriet McDougal

*The New York Times*
called Robert Jordan the American
[heir to Tolkien](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/books/flaming-swords-and-wizards-orbs.html)
.

#### Tom Doherty

Pretty strong statement for the times.

#### Jason Denzel

In a matter of three books, Robert Jordan had developed an international following.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan was a genius. He kept so much in his head. He had
*so much depth*
and wealth of worldbuilding for this series, it's mind-boggling. We've got somewhere around three million plus words of text. The notes are just as big.

#### Tom Doherty

There are very few things to which people had been willing to give this enormous commitment.
