#### Zeynep Dilli

I also asked about what sorts of music he hears in his mind's ear, as it were, while he's writing about the different musical styles in Randland.

#### Robert Jordan

For example, the Tinker music is (obviously) gypsy music, tziganes and similar. Thom chanting the tales is quite like troubadour music of the Middle Ages in continental Europe. As for others—dance music, general folk—he mentioned Irish folk music (gigs and reels, I guess, and ballads), Appalachian Hill music, and bluegrass.

#### Zeynep Dilli

I don't quite know where that last comes from, but oh well.

Overall, it was fun.
