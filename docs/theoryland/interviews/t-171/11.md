# [Interview #171, Entry #11]: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#11)

#### Zeynep Dilli

His favorite character?

#### Robert Jordan

First he gave the standard answer of "whoever I'm writing at the moment"; then the conversation moved to his esteem for the characters, however, and that gave interesting things away. "Lan embodies the ideal I aspired to be. Perrin...was me while I was growing up, but I also behaved a lot like Mat. Harriet says I'm like Loial."

#### Zeynep Dilli

(Slightly after that, Harriet, who'd been browsing the bookstore, came to stand beside me and we struck up a conversation. She is a wonderful lady. While on the subject of how unpleasant it is to be dragged from city to city and hotel to hotel rather than being snug in your own home, she did repeat the Loial comment about her husband, independently.)
