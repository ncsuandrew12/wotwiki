# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#13)

#### Question

[Will there be] a WoT movie?

#### Robert Jordan

"I don't know. If you know Peter Jackson or Spielberg, you can always ask them to give me a call..." No objections to a movie as long as the people coming to him with an offer have
*both*
the means and the knowledge to pull it off. That might be a tougher proposition than even
*Lord of the Rings*
, in my opinion, due to sheer length and number of characters involved.
