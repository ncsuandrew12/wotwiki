# [Interview #171, Entry #5]: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#5)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#4)
): Some kid asked him something about material on the Internet, and he mentioned Wotmania, Dragonmount.com, TarValon.net, and something else. If he said anything about rasfwrj, I didn't hear it.

#### Zeynep Dilli

He didn't, and I paused and decided against mentioning the FAQ there. He mentioned tarvalon.net because the people from the site were next in line to the kid and they called out.
