# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#7)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#6)
): Someone else said something about his health and got a lengthy recitation of Jordan's blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and so on.

#### Zeynep Dilli

At his last physical: cholesterol 197, his doctor not worried about his triglycerides, blood pressure 105/62, resting pulse 68, and he performed exceedingly well in the stress test. He was a little irritated at the question, I think. Can't guess why. Someone else asked if people ever sent him vitamins etc. Nope.
