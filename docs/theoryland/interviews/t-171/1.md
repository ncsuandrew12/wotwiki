# [Interview #171, Entry #1]: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#1)

#### Zeynep Dilli

This is a good place to put in my own report, I guess. Sorry for the delay.

I was there around 11:30 for the signing that was supposed to start around 12:30. There were about 15 people in the bookstore's cafe by then; but by the time 12:30 rolled around there was a sizable line, which stayed full until the end. There were about 50 people in the line almost constantly from 12:30 to 13:30.

I situated myself behind the table and didn't get in the line; John Nowacki and his friends graciously accepted to get my books signed for their second time in the line. Thanks again.
