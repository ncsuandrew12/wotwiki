# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#9)

#### Question

Were Rand and Ishamael physically in the sky at Falme?

#### Robert Jordan

No, but they could be
*seen there*
, like a mirage. They could be seen in other places as well [other false Dragons' falls].

#### Zeynep Dilli

He didn't say
*where*
they were,
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
or some other plane. Wherever, as far as I'm concerned.
