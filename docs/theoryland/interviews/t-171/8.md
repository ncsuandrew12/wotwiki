# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#8)

#### Question

Someone asked him how "knuckling [one's] forehead" was done.

#### Robert Jordan

He described it as a way of touching your cap, as it were, same with "tugging [one's] forelocks"â€”the way he lifted his head to demonstrate both movements, thumb down and palm slightly down and out, a person's knuckles do naturally touch the forehead. "It's how you greet(ed) a superior in military."
