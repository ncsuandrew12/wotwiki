# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#16)

#### Zeynep Dilli

I asked about the Seanchan divorce ceremony, wondering if it was anything like the old Islamic ceremonyâ€”i.e., just declaring that you are divorced.

#### Robert Jordan

He answered that it's more intricate than that. He went into the details about why the marriage ceremony is as it is (as Egeanin explains it in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, nothing new), and said that the divorce required more than just declaring it.
