# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#6)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#5)
): Someone asked for a little more description about the
*sa'sara*
—as in how does he envision one doing it—which he thought was hilarious. He said she was the first person who'd asked him about it and apart from saying it would be like something a non-tourist might see in Cairo or Istanbul, he said it wouldn't be "boring" like a stripper act in the U.S. He seemed to really get a kick out of this question.

#### Zeynep Dilli

What he said. That was fun.
