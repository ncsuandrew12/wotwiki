# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#15)

#### Question

Will he do a European tour?

#### Robert Jordan

I guess his answer applies to a possible Canadian signing as well: If the publisher in $COUNTRY invites him and pays for the journey. The person who asked the question specifically inquired after Belgium. He hasn't had any leads that way from France or Belgium yet, but he mentioned a Hungarian tour is coming up since the publisher there contacted him.

On a slightly related note, and I guess I'm the one that cares most, a Turkish publisher has finally contacted him for a translation. Fantasy translation is a new thing in Turkey, although sci-fi have been translated for years—we got
*Lord of the Rings*
in Turkish only in 1998, for example—and we'll see how good the translation will turn out to be.
