# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#3)

#### Zeynep Dilli

Here's a compilation of questions asked, some of which were from RASFWR-J through me or
[John](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172)
.

How much time elapsed between the last chapter of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
and the epilogue?

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#2)
): He thought for a second before giving an RAFO and adding it was not that much, certainly not months.

#### Zeynep Dilli

What he said.
