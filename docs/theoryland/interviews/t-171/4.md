# [Interview #171: COT Signing Report - Zeynep Dilli, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171#4)

#### Question

Without the True Power to contrast it with, did people in the Age of Legends refer to the 'One Power' and 'True Source', or simply the 'Power' and the 'Source'?

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[John Nowacki's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#3)
): The names would have been the same, he said, since "One Power" was meant to signify that
*saidin*
and
*saidar*
are two halves of the same thing and not different things entirely.

#### Zeynep Dilli

What he said.
