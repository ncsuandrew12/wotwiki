#### Zeynep Dilli

As soon as he came in, he answered some "FAQs" in a loud voice down the line:

#### Robert Jordan

He gave the correct pronunciations for Nynaeve, Egwene, Seanchan etc.; touched the Question That Won't Die as "someone figured it out correctly using evidence prior to
*Winter's Heart*
"; said "There will be at least
*two*
more books. I hope two. I apologize for that" and repeated the usual "I knew the last scene since..."; said that the next book would be coming out as soon as possible after he finishes writing it, and laid down the ground rule for picture-taking: "Men must keep their clothes on. I never try to tell women what to do, but men must keep their clothes on."
