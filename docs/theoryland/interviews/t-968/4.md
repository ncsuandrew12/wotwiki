# [Interview #968: AMOL Signing Report - E. Hyde, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=968#4)

#### E. Hyde

I went to the event in a Wheel of Time costume (I posted a couple of pictures in the gallery) and met up with some people I knew from Dragon\*Con. I already owned all the books I was getting signed, but I did buy a couple of other books while I was there, including Dan Wells'
*Fragments*
(which isn't supposed to be published for a few more days ... exciting!) ;-)
