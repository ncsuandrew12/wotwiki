# [Interview #968: AMOL Signing Report - E. Hyde, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=968#2)

#### E. Hyde

I asked if assassination is common among the Parshendi, since they have a tradition of what assassins are supposed to wear.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said (and I'm paraphrasing) that the Parshendi are a lot more unified than they used to be, and back when they existed as a lot of separate tribes (he didn't say how long ago this was), raids and assassinations were a fairly regular thing.
