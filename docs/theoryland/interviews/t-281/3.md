# [Interview #281: Robert Jordan's Blog: A FINAL CHECK-IN BEFORE MAYO, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=281#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For Tony W, the last book of the main story arc,
*A Memory of Light*
, won't be the last Wheel of Time novel. True, I want to move on to the Infinity of Heaven books, not to mention some other books, but there are two more prequel novels to come, and maybe a set of three outrigger novels.
