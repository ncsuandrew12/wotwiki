# [Interview #281: Robert Jordan's Blog: A FINAL CHECK-IN BEFORE MAYO, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=281#6)

#### Robert Jordan

An old one, for Perrab, I believe. No, the pipe smoking had nothing to with the amyloidosis. So far this year I've had four chest X-rays and two helical CAT scans of my chest. I understand that the Mayo is in talks with Switzerland about licensing them my film as an ad for the clean air of the Alps. I hope the rumors are false, because that would be wrong. Besides, I should get a cut.
