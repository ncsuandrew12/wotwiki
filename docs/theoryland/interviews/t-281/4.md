# [Interview #281: Robert Jordan's Blog: A FINAL CHECK-IN BEFORE MAYO, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=281#4)

#### Robert Jordan

Somebody a while back wanted to know whether I had ever received any awards. I was given a Straniak for the Wheel of Time by the Congress of Russian Science Fiction Writers, and some years back my French publisher informed me that I had been nominated for a prize, but at this late date I forget which one. Aside from that, I've never received or been nominated for any other awards.
