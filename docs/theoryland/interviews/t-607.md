## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#1)

#### Isabel

Very small report: Pancakes and fries meet 2011

DISCLAIMER: I typed below report around 23.00 hours, when I was really tired and had a headache. As people might notice, my English deteriorates when I am mad or tired. All mistakes are mine. Next time I won't post a report so quickly, but try to make sure it's gramatically correct first (although that probably won't happen, but I can try).

Other dutchies will probably write a better report. I will keep editing and improving this one.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#2)

#### Isabel

Hey all,

I just had a great day today. This morning I signed for my house. So I officially own a house now (that will be built and hopefully ready in 2012).

After that I went to work and suddenly got a text by Dai Shan around 3.30 that Brandon was in Amsterdam. Brandon missed his flight to Oslo in Amsterdam, so he had time left.

So of course I did a little fangirl cheer and dropped everything I was doing at work and went to Amsterdam. Thankfully I didn't have a meet this afternoon at work. So I could actually do this.

I arrived in Amsterdam around 4, although we weren't supposed to meet up till 4.45. I walked to the dam square, but didn't see Brandon anywhere. I was thinking of heading to the ABC, but I thought if I went there I wouldn't make it on time. So I didn't. Afterwards I heard Brandon was there and signing books, so I should have done it. Apparently the ABC people were really nice and invited him over next time. I think they were even willing to pay for hotel and train in Europe?

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#3)

#### Isabel

When Brandon arrived around 5 at the meeting spot, there were about 11 other dutchies who made it. Pretty big group. Especially when you get a warning less than three hours before the meet. It was on a working day.

The restaurant we were planning to go to was full. Someone of the group was so smart to call ahead.
So I actually guided all the people to find a restaurant were they had pancakes. We ended up in a restaurant near the Central Station (Blom).

It was really fun there. Just to hang out and talk. And Brandon found out that you don't put salt on your pancake (he took one with cheese and bacon) and he took some fries with mayonnaise.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#4)

#### Isabel

Oh yeah, I first asked him some questions about the influence of the Dark One at Shayol Ghul. I first tried to ask about the influence of the Dark One around Shayol Ghul in the Age of Legends, but that really went nowhere. So I just asked about the current influence at Shayol Ghul.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The ceiling in the tunnel to the Bore is actually being lowered by the Dark One and he can actually close it. So it's not imaginary.

#### Footnote

The question is referring to the
[tunnel with the stalactites](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=150610#poststop)
at Shayol Ghul.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#5)

#### Isabel

Another question I asked was about the structure of
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is perfectly clear, Brandon knows every scene, but he just has to write it.

The title
*A Memory of Light*
is still fitting for the book. I was wondering about it, because RJ origiinally wanted all in one book.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#6)

#### Isabel

There were more questions also about his other books, but I don't remember it at this time. Perhaps it will come back tomorrow.

The questions of WSB were:

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#7)

#### Ted Herman

How did Fain know the dagger was in the White Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's because of course he senses it.

#### Isabel

It really felt like a duh question and looking backwards I should have asked more on range and stuff like that. The same with the range of him sensing Rand. Sorry, I failed a little bit as a Theorylander.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#8)

#### Ted Herman

Why did the Seanchan attack Ghealdan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I remember the answer correctly. The Seanchan attack places, because they wanna conquer the whole world and it's not smart to attack the Borderlanders.

#### Isabel

@Terez LOL, I forgot that the Seanchan haven't really launched a full scale attack on Ghealdan yet (in the current time). But it also could be that Brandon interpreted the question differently. The Seanchan did conquer Ghealdan in the vision of Aviendha.

I am not sure what WSB wanted with this question. However it didn't seem there was anything exciting there.

#### Footnote

Ted
[noted](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=150644#poststop)
that the question he intended to have asked was 'Why
*didn't*
the Seanchan attack Ghealdan?' He managed to ask that question
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=627#13)
.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#9)

#### Isabel

Oh yeah, I also asked about the
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
fight (that was actually during the walk to the restaurant) and if the Black Ajah shouldn't have been more blurred out. See discussion at
[Readandfindout.com](http://www.readandfindout.com/wheeloftime/messageboard/209917/)
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He told me that someone sent him a theory about it. He was thinking if he would post that theory and tell what parts are wrong and right (if i remember correctly). Or he was thinking of keeping the answer a secret.

#### Footnote

The fight in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
took place in
*Towers of Midnight*
Chapters 37-38. This Q&A led to a
[Twitter conversation](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#146)
which cleared up the issue somewhat.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#10)

#### Isabel

Oh yeah, about the release date [of
*A Memory of Light*
].

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon hopes to finish the book this year, but the release date depends on how fast the editing is going. Harriet wants to take six months to edit it. As everyone knows, last year was hell and went too quickly with editing.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#11)

#### Isabel

During the meal I got text messages by Dai Shan, about how crappy it was that he was playing piano for ballet classes and couldn't be here.

YKS was also at work, but she was around 6.30 at central station and at that time Brandon needed to head back to the airport. So she went with us to get him there. It was really good to see Doris again.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#12)

#### Isabel

#### Brandon Sanderson

During the train ride I asked about the Black Ajah hunters. Because I felt like there was so much built up and not everything was dealt with. So I asked if for example there weren't that many notes on it. But it was, most of those Egewene parts were RJ's. So I guess it didn't go like I expected.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#13)

#### Isabel

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon is working also on the prologue, chapter one, and some other random scenes for
*A Memory of Light*
. He told us that one part of the prologue is mostly RJ's. For the last book it was the Borderlands part in the prologue and the farmer part in
*The Gathering Storm*
.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#14)

#### Isabel

There were also other probably interesting questions, but I forgot. Sorry. Really tired now, going to sleep.

Before I forget: there were two people who made this meeting possible. One woman (I forgot her name) who picked up Brandon at the airport and Martijn(?) who gave Brandon a tour from three till 4.45 (and tweeted with him beforehand). Thanks for helping Brandon and tweeting with him.

Oh and I didn't take any notes, so let's wait and see what other people confirm. The sentences are how I remember it (and could be that some questions are already asked).

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#15)

#### Isabel

I edited a few small things. Sorry for the crappy English and everything, but I wanted to write the report. Perhaps next time, I will wait with writing till my head is cleared. :P :P :P :P

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#16)

#### Isabel

[Another thing](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=150616#poststop)
I will add in my report later.

I might have mentioned something to Brandon that I would be very upset if Nynaeve died.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He of course said that if she died it wasn't Brandon's fault. And I think he mentioned something that of course some people would die in the Last Battle.
