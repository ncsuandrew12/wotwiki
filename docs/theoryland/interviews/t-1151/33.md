#### Question

What were some of first [Epic] powers you thought about but didn't do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A lot of the early powers I thought of were ones that big superheroes already have and use too much, like electricity or some of these things. So I'm like, I want powers that I can do something new with, not something that I'll just repeat what Marvel and DC have done.
