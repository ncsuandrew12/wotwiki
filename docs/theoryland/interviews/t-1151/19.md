#### Question

You mentioned that the flakes of metal are catalysts to access the powers of Preservation. What do the birds from Patji use as catalysts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You don't always have to have the exact same thing for catalysts, for that itâ€™s kind of more of an innate connection, in the same way that the metals have an innate connection. They ARE the catalyst if that makes sense.
