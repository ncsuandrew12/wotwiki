#### Question

Are you doing any video game work these days? I know you did some work with Infinity Blade stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm actually going to LA to hear some pitches on video game stuff on Monday, so yes, but I haven't yet been able to get anything made. So we shall see if it ever happens. I've helped the Infinity Blade guys with their next game also, just as an advisory position thing. That's been fun. Their next game's going to be awesome.
