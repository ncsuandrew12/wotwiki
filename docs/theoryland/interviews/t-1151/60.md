# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#60)

#### Question

Did something happen to Demoux between Mistborn and Stormlight to turn him into a jerk, or am I misinterpreting his actions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is not a jerk, but he is not...

#### Question

As pure as he is in Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. He's a little more idealistic than pure, how about that?

#### Question

Are we going to hear [his] story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. [...] I'm toying with some stuff in Secret History too [two?], it'll get into some of this.

#### Question

Is there going to be more Secret History?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have to go into the cracks between other books, but not...I am planning to do more right now, I'm not opposed to having more like that happen.
