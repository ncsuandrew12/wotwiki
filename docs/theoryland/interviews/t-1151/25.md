#### Question

Which of your books do you think would be the best to adapt into a musical?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A musical? Uhh...I have not given that a whole lot of thought...um...Alcatraz, because it's silly, it's kind of a silly idea.

#### Question

Okay. I thought I might ask you one you haven't heard before.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You win a prize. That's one I haven't heard before.
