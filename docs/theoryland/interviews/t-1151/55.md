# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#55)

#### Question

What is the thing with Adolin's serial dating? Is it just...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is bad with relationships, and that's just it. He's a little bit scared of being good at relationships, and so there's some kind of unconscious sabotaging going on. But yeah, he's young and he's bad at relationships.

#### Question

Do the Radiants have only one gender per [order], or you can have...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You have - yeah. There can be different genders.

#### Question

Why is Dalinar very restrictive of Adolin but not with Renarin and Elhokar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a little bit - I would say a slight flaw on Dalinar's part, he's too hard on Adolin. But that's because Adolin is in line for the throne, and he's the eldest son, and the heir, and all of that stuff. I would say that Dalinar's a little too lax in some ways, a little too strict in others.
