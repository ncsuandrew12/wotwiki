# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#32)

#### Question

Do we get to find out eventually where Calamity comes from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Eventually, like the next trilogy I do will dig into that... You've got to remember, in the teen books I’m not going to dig into lore as much, they're written as action novels. So in the next series I'll get you some of your answers, but that's not what the point of these books-- like The Stormlight Archive, the point is the lore. In these books, the point is “have fun”. So you will, but it's going to take a little bit longer.
