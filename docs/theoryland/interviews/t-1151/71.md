#### Question

[on David's bad metaphors]

#### Brandon Sanderson

It came from me writing a bad metaphor on accident, and then being like, "I'm going to run with this and see where it goes." I like it [as a character quirk] for David because his personality is that he's a little overzealous about things, and so trying so hard on the metaphors is a great way to express that.
