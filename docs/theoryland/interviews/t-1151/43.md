#### Question

In-world? Jasnah would, but I don’t think most people who read it would.

#### Question

Do they have a concept of alcoholism in Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Does Dalinar’s family have it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmmmm… That will be answered in the next book, but you should definitely be asking that question.

#### Question

Is there an abolitionist movement in Roshar? In any culture there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In ANY culture? Eh...yeees.

#### Question

Are we ever going to find out about all of Adolin’s failed relationships?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably a little bit more. Not a ton. But a little bit more.
