#### Question

The ten Surges on Roshar, I think you said are basically a different set of laws of physics.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Question

Are those laws of physics consistent throughout the Cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes, to an extent. You would consider, like - it's kind of weird because I based them on the idea of the fundamental forces, but this is kind of like a human construction. Like you could say that physics is pure and natural, but we're still putting things in boxes. And the scientists on Roshar would for instance consider being able to travel between the Cognitive and Physical Realms as a force, the thing that pulls people back and forth between that, as a fundamental force. I don't know if it would fit our definition of a fundamental force.
