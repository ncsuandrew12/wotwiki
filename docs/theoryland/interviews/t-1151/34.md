#### Question

Are you friends with James Dashner?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Dashner and I go way, way back. I read Maze Runner before it was published, which was pretty cool, and then I gave him this cool quote about how good it is and he didn't even put it on the book when it was published. I was like, "Aw, come on, James!" But yeah, I met him in a middle school, when we were both brand-new writers. He was going in to talk to students, and I went in right after him.
