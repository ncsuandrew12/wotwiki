#### Question

The Cognitive and the Physical Realms...do they [?] to the Shardworld for the character they're related to, or can you go back and forth - like in Secret History, when he passes off of Scadrial and to the outskirts, within I guess the Cognitive Realm, is that something they could do with other Shardworlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Footnote

the question seems incomplete
