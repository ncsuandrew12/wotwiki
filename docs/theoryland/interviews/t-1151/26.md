#### Question

I heard somewhere that you were trying to find time to play Bloodborne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did play Bloodborne. I liked it.

#### Question

It was hard for me, man. [... just with the patch?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Get the axe, the big axe, take it to its big thing, learn to use the [charge?] attack, spin around and hit things before they get to you. And then you'll be fine.

#### Question

Right on. I'll get back to it.
