# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#5)

#### Question

What were your inspiration when you wrote the [Mistborn] series, or for particular characters...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, Mistborn-- I passed, honestly, through a fog bank at 70 mph driving from my mom's house, and I'm like, "This looks cool, I've got to use this." That's the first thought I can think of. Feruchemy goes back to being in high school and being an insomniac, being really tired and wishing I could store up my sleep, so I'd be sleepy when I wanted to be sleepy. Kelsier's inspiration was a guy who had been only out for himself, who realized the greater import of doing something.
