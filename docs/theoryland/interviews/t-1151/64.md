# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#64)

#### Question

How long did you work on the signature?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's kind of interesting, since it started off being legible, kind of like that, that's "Brandon" and then a "Sanderson". And then it just over ten years turned into...This is the B and that's the rest of my name, and then that's the S.

#### Question

Speed, efficiency. Looks cool too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, my handwriting's so sloppy anyway that I figure a symbol is better than trying to write it out.

#### Question

It makes you look like a doctor, too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that's right.
