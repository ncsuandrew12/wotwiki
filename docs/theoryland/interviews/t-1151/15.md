# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#15)

#### Question

I want you to know that our third graders think that our librarian is evil now.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh good, good, good. I'm very pleased to be corrupting your third graders.

#### Question

And they're very suspicious of anyone in horn-rimmed glasses.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmm. I need to get myself some, because it would be like, cognitive dissonance to the kids. [...] You tell them they're not allowed to have as bad handwriting as me. MY third-grade teacher thinks it's atrocious that I never learned how to have good handwriting. She'll never forgive me.
