#### Question

Marvel or DC?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[big sigh] So Marvel makes better movies, generally, I classically am a fan of Batman and Superman, but I feel like Marvel's been knocking it out of the park and I did not like the Man of Steel movie. And so it's kind of like half and half. I'm going to say Marvel right now until DC redeems itself.
