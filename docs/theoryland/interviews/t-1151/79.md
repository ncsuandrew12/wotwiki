#### Question

In Alloy of Law, I noticed that when Marsh is talking to Marasi, he says that Wax is doing his brother’s work, is that referring to Harmony or Kelsier?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s referring to Kelsier in that quote, in his opinion at the moment. I don’t know if I agree with it. He feels that Wax is protecting the people, the little people, which was Kelsier’s work. In his opinion, which is kind of lofty.
