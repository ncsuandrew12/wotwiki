# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#30)

#### Question

Oo, I'm signing a Magic box. Is this...

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a peasant cube.

#### Brandon Sanderson

A peasant cube! So it includes uncommons, right? Pauper is common only, right?

#### Question

Yeah, yeah, it's not enough diversity with just commons.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I made a common-only cube and it just felt like 4/4's hitting each other in the face.

#### Question

It's aggro, that's the thing. But with this you can get combo, you can get control, red range...

#### Brandon Sanderson

What's the combo? Is there like a storm deck in peasant?

#### Question

You can play [?] storm deck in peasant, all the pieces are common and uncommon, but what I most like is to draft [crystal shards?] and [? drifters]...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, that's a combo after my own heart.

#### Question

And then I had a [Sphinx's Tutelage] in place, so I mill my opponents out, and they're like, Are you seriously going to do this? And I'm like, I seriously am.

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughing] Oh, that's brilliant. That's brilliant. No, you can't [scoop?], no.
