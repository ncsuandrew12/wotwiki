# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#29)

#### Question

A lot of your books deal with dealing with mortality. Do you have a contingency author lined up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't have one lined up, I just have good notes. And my assistant knows what authors I like and things like that, it would really just depend on how long I last. Like right now I'd probably ask Brian McClellan to do it, but who knows, he might be too big by...but hopefully I'd last until I'm like 90 and we just need someone to finish like one book.
