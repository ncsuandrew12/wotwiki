#### Question

You've said that Shardblades can be made in other magic systems. So if it's not like a Shardblade from Roshar, what makes it a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The “shard” refers to the heavy investiture of a Shard of Adonalsium. Most of what you’ll see will be the Roshar ones, but it is technically possible to make them out of the other magic systems. It's going to be a heavily invested magical weapon is kind of how I would define it.

#### Question

So are the Bands one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ummm... I would not call them one, but they are close, they're not Invested enough.
