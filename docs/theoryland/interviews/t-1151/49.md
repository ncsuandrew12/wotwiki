#### Question

What does a mistcloak/coat look like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mistcoat: Duster that’s been shredded into strips. But remember, there’s not like an industry that makes these. Each person commissions their own, and so they vary quite widely.

#### Question

Are they at the waist, or…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s a little above the waist.
