#### Question

Lady taking photos: Best baby photo ever, huh?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m just glad you didn’t ask me to sign the baby, since that’s happened to me before. I feel very weird signing babies.

#### Question

You're definitely our favorite author. You're the first author [we recommended to each other?].

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, that's great. The first one I recommended to my wife was Robert Jordan.
