#### Question

When you're writing, do you hear Michael Kramer in your head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do now. I asked for him by name because I liked how he and Kate Reading did the Wheel of Time books. Yeah, I get a big kick out of doing Wayne's voices and trying to figure out how Michael's going to try to read those.
