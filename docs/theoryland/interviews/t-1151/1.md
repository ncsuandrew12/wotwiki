# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#1)

#### Question

I just wanted to say thank you. I'm in the last two months of my Emergency Medicine residency, so it was eight years of medical training, and you're the only fiction author I've read.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow. I feel impressed.

#### Question

I don't have time for fiction really.

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I was in grad school I didn't get much reading done either. I wasn't in your style of grad school, I was in easy grad school, but I still understand.

#### Question

Yeah, every time you release something, I make time for it. I'm very appreciative of being able to participate in your world.
