If someone goes to every planet and get Invested from every shard, if he was Invested enough would he become a new Shard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s an excellent question that I’m not going to answer.

#### taveren

I guess you will not answer if anyone is trying to do that

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yup, I am not going to answer. Sorry. That's too deeply related to things that are happening in the cosmere and I don’t want to dig into for a little while yet.
