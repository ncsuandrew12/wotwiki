#### Question

I was curious if the world of Sixth of the Dusk was going to make another appearance...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will likely make another appearance, I am unlikely to do another story there just because I have too many things to do sequels too, but if you keep your eyes open, you can see...

#### Question

Is Hoid related?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will see some more.
