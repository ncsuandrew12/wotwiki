# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#24)

#### Question

The magic system you wrote in the Wheel of Time, that seems like a non-constrained system, and then most of your worlds have a constrained system of magic. Which one was harder to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Time was harder to write, because just my natural inclination is the other way.
