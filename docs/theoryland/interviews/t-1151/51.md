#### Question

Where do you go when you come home after your 105 days on tour, where do you go with your family to just like be quiet...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Just my house. Basically - my kids are still little, so it's come home and let them climb on me. That's what we do. Play whatever video game they're into at the moment.
