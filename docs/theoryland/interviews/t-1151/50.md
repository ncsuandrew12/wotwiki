#### Question

How do you get to sleep until noon with three children?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have a very, very patient, loving and wonderful wife. And in recompense, we make sure that the company has an assistant for her who comes in at 9 o'clock and helps get the kids off to school and then watches the 3-year-old for a few hours so she can do work. She has some sanity lent in that way. She was a schoolteacher for years, so she can get up, right? It's a schoolteacher thing.
