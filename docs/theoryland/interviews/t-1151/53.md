# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #53](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#53)

#### Question

So in the Stormlight Archive, they have the two Surges, and they have a third power effect, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have kind of effects on each other, like a reverberation. Yes. I wouldn’t call it expressly a third power, I’d call it interactions.

#### Question

So, it seems like...you don’t have to confirm anything, but it seems like Kaladin is able to transfer his powers to his men following him…

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Windrunners are known for having lots of squires.

#### Question

And the Skybreakers seem like they’re really good at hunting people down.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m not going to answer any of those! But good questions!
