# [Interview #1151: Calamity-Austin, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#23)

#### Question

As you were constructing the Allomantic powers revealed in the Wax and Wayne books, I was just curious why you chose cadmium and chromium to be metals.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well I picked them way back when I designed the magic system, and I wanted metals that would be easily recognizable but which wouldn't be commonly available in a medieval society, so that as society progressed it would make sense, they would have access to these new metals, if that makes sense. Aluminum was a little in that as well, but I like aluminum because they had it anciently, but very rarely. So it could be a more mythical metal.
