#### Question

Do you wish you had [?] any of your stories based on fan feedback?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, with the exception of a few things in the Wheel of Time, where there a few things I don't think I got quite right. With my books, I'm pretty confident...I mean, that doesn't mean everyone will love everything about them, but I'm confident that I told the story I wanted to tell, and sometimes that's not the story everybody wants, but it is the story I felt was the right story.
