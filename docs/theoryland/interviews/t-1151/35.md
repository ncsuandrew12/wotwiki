#### Question

How long did it take you to come up with the bad metaphors in the Reckoners?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was really hard. I thought it'd be easy, cause writing bad stuff you usually do on accident, and then it took me forever to come up with them. It was the hardest part of the books.

#### Question

Yeah, it wasn't that they were bad, they were just a different way of thinking...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's right.
