#### Question

What era were you reading comics and what...

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first comic I got into was the original Eastman and Larry[?] TMNT, which I really really liked, and after that I read what people gave me, so like Sandman - I mean, I'm the kid of the 90's, right? The Gaiman stuff, and Watchmen of course, but that's my era, Kingdom Come. the good graphic novels that have a complete story were always my favorite, anytime I would get into something else, I would get into it and then they'd change writers or something like this and I'd get annoyed. Nowadays my favorite comic is actually a webcomic.
