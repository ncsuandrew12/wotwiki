#### Question

Thoughts on Force Awakens?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I liked The Force Awakens. I thought it was a good film. I was a little disappointed in another Death Star, but I understand that the idea is to introduce a new generation to the concept of Star Wars, and in that case it fulfilled its role. I thought the characters were really good, and that's the most important part.

#### Question

Who was your favorite?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm going to say the Storm Trooper dude, what's his name, Finn.

#### Question

I liked Poe, he was precious.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was, he was. But I really enjoyed Finn as a character.
