# [Interview #234: KOD Signing Report - Jarrod, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=234#7)

#### Jarrod

Overall it was an enjoyable experience. I met some nice people, enjoyed the company of fellow WoT'ers, and spoke with the man himself. My only regret is that I didn't get more time to sincerely congratulate and wish him the best of luck because the line was itching for their turn. This was definitely one of the better experiences of my life, and I hope the next book tour is just as much fun.

â€”Jarrod
