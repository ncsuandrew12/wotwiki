# [Interview #234: KOD Signing Report - Jarrod, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=234#6)

#### Robert Jordan

After the Q&A people were instructed to get in line according to their letter which was given to them from the main desk and were informed that Mr. Jordan would only be signing two hardcover Wheel of Time books per trip through the line, and if time permitted attendees could take a second trip through to get more books signed. Mr. Jordan also announced that he had no problem with taking photos as long as there was absolutely no male nudity, which got a nice laugh from the crowd.
