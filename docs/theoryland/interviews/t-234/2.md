# [Interview #234: KOD Signing Report - Jarrod, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=234#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Mr. Jordan made his way up the steps to the podium and applause died which resulted in a "don't stop" from the man, and everyone took up the applause once more. Like most of the other reports, Jordan was a warm, inviting, humorous man from the start. He opened with a run-down of pronunciations regarding some of the most commonly misspoken words followed by a Q&A session where some old questions were rehashed, and some odd questions were given odd answers.
