#### Ben P. Indick

How do you approach your characters? For example, Tuon, a delightful tease to her would-be lover, Mat.

#### Robert Jordan

When I write from someone's point of view, I try to really get inside that person's skin and they become my favorite character, but I must say I like Tuon even when I'm writing from other points of view. She's an intelligent, capable woman who has grown up in a competitive and highly deadly atmosphere. She and her siblings must compete to prove their worth. The winner will be the heir to the throne. She is short, slender, and wishes she had more bosom and height, so she thinks she has no presence and must make up for it by her skill.
