#### Ben P. Indick

Do you have a notion of when The Wheel of Time will be finished?

#### Robert Jordan

I can't exactly say. I can't get as much story into one book as I'd like, but one of the first things I came up with was the final scene of the final book. About 1984. I knew exactly where I was going.

#### Ben P. Indick

Couldn't later events alter that final scene?

#### Robert Jordan

Possibly, but I'd be surprised. You see, my characters don't write the book. I do. I am an Old Testament god, and they do what I want them to do.
