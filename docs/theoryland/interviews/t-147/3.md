#### Ben P. Indick

Like Tolkien's
*The Lord of the Rings*
but unlike the works of other post-Tolkien writers, The Wheel of Time is unusual in being one novel, of which
*Crossroads of Twilight*
is the latest installment [see review p. 50].

#### Robert Jordan

One novel, one very long novel. Because of the overlapping nature of the books, in the later books, they are not even sequential in the sense that the events of one book end and the next book begins. The events may begin back during the events of the preceding book.

#### Ben P. Indick

Would you recommend readers start with
*Crossroads of Twilight*
?

#### Robert Jordan

For many years, I've seen bookstore managers' faces go deathly pale, the blood draining from their faces, when I told someone, "Put that nice expensive hardcover back on the shelf and go buy that paperback over there, because you have to start at the beginning with
*The Eye of the World*
. You start here and you are bound to get utterly confused and won't understand what's going on."

#### Ben P. Indick

Didn't you feel you had to make every book accessible to newcomers?

#### Robert Jordan

At first I thought I must make these books able to be picked by anybody at any place, but with the third book,
*The Dragon Reborn*
, I began to realize this wasn't possible. I have too much to explain that I've already explained. I was asked to write one-page summaries and I replied, "It can't be done."
