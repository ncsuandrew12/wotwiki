#### Ben P. Indick

You're one of today's major fantasy authors. Did you always know you wanted to write?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, defining "always" as being from the age of five, but when I was about nine or ten, it became clear to me that writers couldn't make a living in the United States. They always had some other means of employment. The writers making a living seemed to live in Cuba or the south of France. I wasn't so sure about moving to the south of France when I was nine.
