#### Brandon Sanderson

My name is Brandon Sanderson. I began writing seriously about 15 years ago now, was unpublished at the time. Spent many years trying to break in and write that book that would hopefully sell and make me able to make a living as a writer. I went to BYU as an undergraduate. After I graduated, still hadn't published, but by that point I'd finished around seven or eight novels, so I was pretty sure this was something I wanted to do. I loved doing it, I loved writing. I've now published eight or nine novels, most of them epic fantasy. I do have a children's series, called
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
, targeted at 11-, 12-, 13-year-olds who are too smart for their own good.

In 2007, I was asked by Robert Jordan's widow to complete the Wheel of Time novels, which had long been favorites of mine. Robert Jordan passed away in 2007. And the first of three that will finish that series, called
*The Gathering Storm*
, came out last year and was a #1
*New York Times*
bestseller.
