## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

Went to the signing in Idaho Falls today and asked BS if we had seen Demandred's alter ego on screen and he gave me a R.A.F.O. card and said that Demandred's identity is the biggest secret in the series and will pay off in the end.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

I asked if the pacing would be the same in
*Towers of Midnight*
as it was in
*The Gathering Storm*
and he said that
*The Gathering Storm*
was like books 1-3 and
*Towers of Midnight*
would be like 4-6. I'm not sure if this is new or not but thought I'd post it.
