# [Interview #232: KOD Signing Report - Allentrace, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=232#10)

#### Allentrace

After several minutes of questions RJ moved to signing books, with groups of 25 at a time being called into line. All during the time I was waiting for my turn I watched RJ's interaction with the people whose books he was signing, and I can say without hesitation he was one of the nicest authors I have ever met. He never seemed bored by questions the individuals asked (even repetitive ones) as they were getting their books signed and always seemed enthused to answer them. When it came my time I was only too happy to have him shake my hand and take a picture of him signing my books. As I mentioned I would be attending the Anchorage, AK signing, he said that he was happy to be able to go and meet his AK fans and to get some salmon fishing done. It was a great day and I was happy to find that one of my favorite authors is also such a nice man.
