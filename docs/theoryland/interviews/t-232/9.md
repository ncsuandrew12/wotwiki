RJ also briefly outlined in what was my favorite part of the Q and A the nature of the other two prequels. Specifically what made Tam al'Thor decide to give up a "lucrative military career" and move to the Two Rivers and buy a small farm, and how Lan and Moiraine arrived in the Two Rivers when they did in
