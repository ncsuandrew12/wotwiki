# [Interview #232: KOD Signing Report - Allentrace, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=232#1)

#### Allentrace

I attended the book signing in Cincinnati, OH today, Saturday October 22nd 2005. There was a strong gathering of people for the book signing, much more so than it seems other dates have garnered so far. I arrived with my friend around 12:30pm and we were numbers 80 and 81 in line to have our books signed at 2:00pm.

#### Robert Jordan

A little before 2:00pm Robert Jordan arrived with his wife Harriet a few seconds behind him. As he entered to applause, RJ sat down at the table provided by Border's and situated himself for a few moments before addressing the crowd. He began by addressing pronunciations of several key figures and places, which have already been covered by others on Dragonmount.
