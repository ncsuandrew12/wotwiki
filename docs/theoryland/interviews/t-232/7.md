# [Interview #232: KOD Signing Report - Allentrace, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=232#7)

#### Question

A question a girl asked, which is often asked, is why Rand gets to sleep with three women.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ laughed at this and explained the usual story of his earlier life when he dated two women. He explained if he could have two, why could Rand not have three?

#### Allentrace

I tried to catch Harriet's response to this but my vision of her was obscured.
