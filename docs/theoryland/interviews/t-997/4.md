# [Interview #997: The Rithmatist: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=997#4)

#### The Book Smugglers

Do you read YA speculative fiction? Which books or authors are your favorites in the young readers category?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've already mentioned a bunch of my favorites, but I could go on! I'm quite fond of Westerfeld's work. I think it's quite marvelous. I've read Terry Pratchett's teen books. If you've only read his adult work, you're really missing out. He is quite good. I've also enjoyed James Dashner's and Eva Ibbotson's books.

I got into a lot of the YA classics in the late 90s, well after everyone else had been into them. Things like
*The Giver*
by Lois Lowry and
*Dragon's Blood*
by Jane Yolen. Jane Yolen has long been one of my favorite writers. There's just a lot of exciting things happening in YA, and I feel inspired by a lot of the works by those authors I've mentioned.
