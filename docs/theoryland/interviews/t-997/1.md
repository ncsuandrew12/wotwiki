#### The Book Smugglers

Today we are thrilled to host Brandon Sanderson for an interview about his latest novel,
*The Rithmatist*
. Brandon is an established author of adult-aimed fantasy, among his works the awesome Mistborn series,
*Warbreaker*
, The Stormlight Archive series, and, of course, his completion of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. We are big fans of Brandon's, so were thrilled when we learned he would be penning a YA series, starting with
*The Rithmatist*
.
