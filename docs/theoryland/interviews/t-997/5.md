# [Interview #997: The Rithmatist: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=997#5)

#### The Book Smugglers

In all of your other books, you write strong, layered female charactersâ€”what can we expect from
*The Rithmatist*
in the protagonist/heroine department?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I often worry about falling into the trap of making female characters strong by not making them feminine. In Mistborn, Vin is strong in part because of how good of a warrior she is, and that's fine. There are plenty of women like that, who can hold their own in a fight. But in
*The Rithmatist*
, one of the things I wanted to do was write a female character who is more girly, so to speak. I wanted to make her a strong protagonist in a way that does not undermine her femininity. I hope that I've managed to approach that with Melody in
*The Rithmatist*
.
