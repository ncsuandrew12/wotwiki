What will happen to the fifth
*Alcatraz novel*
if Scholastic doesn't pick it up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I do want to write it, and Tor would publish it in a secondâ€”but I can't take time away from WoT right now. So MAYBE Tor will publish it. A lot depends on the film, which is being developed by Dreamworks Animation. The Dreamworks option runs out in December.
