# [Interview #541, Entry #2]: Chat with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#2)

#### East Coast Girl

You've met Mr. Jordan right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Saw him once at a convention. Was too chicken to go meet him. Still feel stupid.

#### EAST COAST GIRL

To be honest I was a little mad that Robert Jordan wasn't gonna finish WOT (actually make that a LOT mad) but I've kinda mellowed a bit :)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I'm there with you all the way. Perhaps I shouldn't admit this, but a good friend and I used to have a thing where we would shake our fists at the sky whenever Mr. Jordan's name was mentioned. (This was before he died.)

#### EAST COAST GIRL

Mr. Sanderson honestly you wouldn't believe the fits I went through right after he died, but purely for selfish reasons: I wanted to know who killed Asmodean NAO!! :P

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

If you haven't heard, I DO know, and it WILL be in the books. Somewhere. I can't say if it will be in
*Towers of Midnight*
or not.
