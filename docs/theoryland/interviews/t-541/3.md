# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#3)

#### Milk Man

How much flack have you gotten for the deadline changes for WOT?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, a medium amount. Most were mad at the start, but my post about why we split calmed many. Reading
*The Gathering Storm*
calmed many more.

#### Milk Man

Glad to hear they understood!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I think, reading
*The Gathering Storm*
, people could see just how much still has to be done in these books. So they understood I couldn't fit it all in one volume.
