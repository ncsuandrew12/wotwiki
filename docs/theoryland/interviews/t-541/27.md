# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#27)

#### Luckers

Was Elayne's 'relief' Rand felt in
*The Gathering Storm*
the relief of gaining the throne, or is that tying to more recent events? Like, is Rand up to date with Elayne yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

To be honest, Luckers, I'd have to go look at my timeline. I'm pretty sure Rand was at June (our world months) at the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
. Perrin ended at beginning of April. Elayne...grrr Can't remember. But Rand/Egwene are in sync with one another as of the end of that book. I think Elayne is just a tad behind.
