What is the sister ship of the Pacific Jewel cruise ship? What was the first DVD by the Christian metalcore band Underoath? When did the Center for Survey Research at Ohio State University close? (Hope these questions are random enough.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### ERICJAMESSTONE

You got it. 99-cent menu at Wendy's, here we come!
