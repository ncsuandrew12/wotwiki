# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#10)

#### Erik Holmes

Sup Brandon.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hey, Erik. How's California?

#### ERIK HOLMES

It's not too bad, just been going to the beach (a LOTâ€”my wifes a surfergirl) and trying to get my flippin book done. Brandon/Howard, do you guys try to get all of the local authors on Writing Excuses? The published ones that is.

#### HOWARD TAYLER

Local authors are like Pokemon. We have to catch them all.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Honestly, we don't have much trouble. Authors like to talk. (See: This conversation.) Give them a platform, and most will talk. Particularly on a podcast with a lot of listeners.

#### ERIK HOLMES

My buddy lives in Linden and just signed a big deal with S&S for a YA speculative fiction book. But the guy's a hermit and doesn't know any of the local people.

#### HOWARD TAYLER

Get him out to LTUE. We don't bite very hard.

#### ERIK HOLMES

Yeah I've been telling him that he should go. His series is supposed to fill the slot left by the Spiderwick Chronicles.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

We'd love to have him on.
