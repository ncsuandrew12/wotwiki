# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#18)

#### Stefan

Has Mat's answer from the 'Finns about living and dying already happened?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the books, Mat says that he's "Pretty Sure" that he'd already died. So use that as a guide.

#### FOOTNOTE

A better guide might be the two

[reports](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=64#8)
, both of which claim RJ said the Caemlyn death fulfilled the prophecy. RJ also confirmed that Mat was only 'almost' dead in Rhuidean to Tim Kington
[in 2003](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#6)
, and
[in 1999](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=108#8)
in Sydney he noted that Mat hopes the prophecy was fulfilled in Rhuidean (because he doesn't remember dying in Caemlyn).

#### SEMIRHAGE666

Wasn't that fulfilled when he was hung from
*Avendesora*
?

#### STEFAN

That's what I'm wondering, whether that was it or not.

#### EAST COAST GIRL

But I thought Mat DIDN'T die when he got hung, just came really close ...

#### MAGICKAL MAN

Mat died and then Rand used balefire and turned back time.

#### STEFAN

Right \*facepalm\* I don't know how I forgot that.

#### RLRHORROCKS

If he had actually died when he was hung, Rand wouldn't have been able to bring him back. (i.e.: crazy puppet girl in the Stone)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Re: Another Mat being hung confirmation. Like I said, Mat's pretty sure that counted for him dying. He really doesn't want to try anything like that again...

#### Footnote

Brandon has consistently presented a "confused" front on this issue; he was still doing it
[in 2011](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#117)
. Most likely he is trying to be clever about it, maybe playing on RJ's 2009 interview, but all it does is stir up the fans who happen to know what RJ said about it (which is a good number of them; it's common knowledge).
