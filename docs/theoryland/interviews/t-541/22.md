# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#22)

#### Golffuul

I was interested in knowing what it is that you research for your books and how you go about doing it. Thanks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do a lot of broad-based reading in historical works. Things like the History of Warfare and the like. From there, I decide what I need to know for a specific book. For
*Mistborn*
, I read a lot on Canal Culture, Alchemy, Eunics, and early 1800's London. Mostly survey works.

#### GOLFFUUL

I was interested in your insights as to what kind of subject matter you research for your books?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I kind of answered this above, but I will say that MOST of it is along the lines of "How did this piece of technology work" or "how did this battle play out." Historical things.
