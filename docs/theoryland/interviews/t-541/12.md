# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#12)

#### The Order Of The 17th Shard

Hey Brandon, any chance you'll be having pre-approved "Storm Leader" type things for the
*Way of Kings*
tour?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm thinking we'll try something else that tour. The Storm Leaders were awesome, but we had Jason to set that all up. I may return to doing something like that on another tour, but this one will involve something else. I'll explain eventually.

#### ERIK HOLMES

Brandon, when does your tour for
*The Way of Kings*
start? I saw that you would be out this way later on in the month

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

*The Way of Kings*
tour starts August 31st. Lasts about 3 weeks, with Dragoncon in the middle.
