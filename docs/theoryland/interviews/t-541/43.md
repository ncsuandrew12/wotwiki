#### Brandon Sanderson

My internet is going crazy. So I think I should just go ahead and say good night for real this time. In answer to those who want to contact me via email, try the web form on my site. Sorry if I missed anyone's questions. I will do this again. If I missed yours, email me. I'll try to get to it. Good night.
