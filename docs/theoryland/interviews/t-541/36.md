# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#36)

#### Luke Chant

Will Hoid be making an appearance in any of the remaining WoT books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he will not. I feel that putting a character from one of my own books into the WoT world would be an act of arrogance. The WoT world is not mine, and I don't want to imply that my characters have any connection to it, or that it's part of 'my' cosmology. (Sorry.) There are other Easter eggs, though. The type Mr. Jordan liked to put in.
