# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#8)

#### reTaardad

Will we see the prologue of
*Towers of Midnight*
soon or is that still up to the publisher?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are right, that's up to the publisher. I'd guess you will see it around September, maybe a little later than last year. But you will probably see it early.
