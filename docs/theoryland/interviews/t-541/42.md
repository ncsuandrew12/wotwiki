# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#42)

#### Bashar

After the WoT I made a decision to never read a series that is in progress. That's why I never read GRRM. Will I have that problem with the Stormlight Archive or will each book have very satisfying conclusions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I try VERY hard to do that in all of my books. So hopefully, yes it will.
