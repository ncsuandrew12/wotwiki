# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#34)

#### Hamm

While I'm sure you have greatly enjoyed finishing the WoT series, do you look forward to being finished with writing them and being able to return to a more normal writing schedule?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and no. It is a LOT of work. These books are the hardest I've ever written. So I will feel good to have them done, and to have the closure out there. But at the same time...the WoT Has been part of my life in one way or another since I was 14. It will be very sad to see it end.
