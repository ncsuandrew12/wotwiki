# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#26)

#### Dylan Snider

Does Gawyn have any fans???

#### STEFAN

No.

#### SEMIRHAGE666

Nope.

#### STEFAN

He's a whiner; even his girlfriend think he's a loser.

#### RWORD

I like Gawyn. Very honorable!

#### MILK MAN

I agree with Rword. He has the same shortcomings as others; he's a little thickheaded, but he'll hopefully get over it.

#### DYLAN

I mean, he stops the rescue of Siuan...

#### RWORD

He has the honor of his brother without being a big snot.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't think even Gawyn has been a fan of Gawyn lately. But he's been through a lot, and has more to him than people are giving him credit for having. He still has a part to play.
