Brandon when do you find time to teach? I've read a couple of your posts where you are grading papers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually never graded finals for my last class. (Whoops.) I will be doing it during tour this year, probably. I teach for fun, so I do it as a hobby. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to do it. (I only teach one class a year.)
