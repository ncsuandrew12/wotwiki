# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#28)

I like how your book covers mysteriously lead us into wrong conclusions about who characters are. Who comes up with that? You mostly, or does publisher have input??

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mostly, those are the publisher's deal. I generally have some input, but only a small input. The longer I go, the more I have to say. Often, I will suggest scenes, but it's up to the publisher/artist to decide. For example, the cover of
*Mistborn*
3 was originally a concept cover for the cover of
*Mistborn*
One. Everyone liked it so much, they decided to tweak the sketch and do a full painting for
*Mistborn*
3.
