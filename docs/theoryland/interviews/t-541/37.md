# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#37)

#### Luckers

Did you get that email I sent? Maria said it was alright, but I wasn't sure it went through?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Luckers, I got your email. I totally forgot to reply, though.

All right, all. Thank you for listening. I'm going to read through the rest of the chat, so I'll see what you said. But I don't have time for more questions. (Hang around. I might post another thought or two.) But for now, we'll call this a wrap. I'll do it again in the future, I promise. I assume Dragonmount or someone will throw up an archive of this. They always do. If you do, please all pretend that my spelling was wonderful and I inserted a few extra chamingly witty comments. ;) Also, lets hope that I didn't say anything that will have Maria on the phone to me Monday groaning about something wrong I said. As always, thank you very much for reading. One of the best things about being involved in these books has been the fan base. You lot are a pretty great group.
