# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#31)

#### Dylan

Are there any male characters who don't know they can channel, but will learn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wonderfully specific question that is EXACTLY the type of thing RJ would RAFO. I will say this. We are not going to be introducing new plot lines in the upcoming books. Robert Jordan was specific. These books are culminations, not thread-starters. So basically, they will be focused on plots you already know about. Mostly. (Not much help there, am I? Sorry.)
