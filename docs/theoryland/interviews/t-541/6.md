# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#6)

#### Milk Man

Were you on set today? Where are we going to see the trailer for
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I couldn't make it out. Too much work to do. But I did get some exclusive pictures sent to me from Jason. ;) I'd say the trailer will be soon. After Tor and Harriet approve it. Maybe for DragonCon?

#### MILK MAN

will it only be seen at DragonCon?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It will NOT be seen only at DragonCon. It should be posted all over the place.
