# [Interview #541, Entry #7]: Chat with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#7)

#### Dylan

Do we see Rand much in the new book? Or will he be like Perrin, Mat or Elayne in
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Will we see Rand in the next book? YES. The book will not be a 100% flash-back like Book 10. There will be a little bit of catch-up for Perrin, but Egwene and Rand both have large parts too.

#### BECKSTER45

Is Mat in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes. Lots of Mat. Promise.

#### RLRHORROCKS

What happened to Elayne? It seemed she fell off the earth in the last book.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It was tough to decide that Elayne would not appear in
*The Gathering Storm*
. I knew we didn't have room for everyone. Thing is, Elayne was way ahead of everyone else in her plotline. (Meaning what she needed to get done.) And so, with great regret, I moved her to
*Towers of Midnight*
. She will appear, as will her wonderful Warder.

#### BECKSTER45

Will we see Galad in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

so far, I'm on record as saying this: Almost everyone who did not appear in
*The Gathering Storm*
appears in
*Towers of Midnight*
. No promises on anyone other than Main Characters, like Mat/Elayne. But expect to see a lot of people return who didn't appear in
*The Gathering Storm*
. Also, Galad happens to be one of my personal favorite characters.

#### FRANKLINE

Do we get anything about Shocklances?

#### MYX

I'm pretty late to this party, so if I don't get an answer to my question..no worries...But any chance of Egwene ever putting Cadsuane in her place?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Re: Shocklances (sp? I should really know that one) and Egwene/Cadsuane. Double RAFO. Pow!
