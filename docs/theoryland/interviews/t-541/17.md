# [Interview #541: Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#17)

#### East Coast Girl

Mr. Sanderson do you work with any of the major WOT fan sites like the Encyclopaedia or Dragonmount?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Encycolpaeda WoT, Tar Valon's Wiki, and the 13th Depository. (Wow, probably didn't spell that one right.) I really like Dragonmount, but I end up working with Jason more than hanging out there.
