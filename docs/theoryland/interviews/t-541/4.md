# [Interview #541, Entry #4]: Chat with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=541#4)

#### Stefan

So we know in
*The Eye of the World*
, there was somebody who talked in capital letters like how the Dark One did. Obviously you can't tell us who it was, but will we know by the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know what that was about. Will it be in the next book? Er...RAFO. Sorry.

#### STEFAN

Will we know by the end of the series though?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I really can't say yes or no. This is one of the things Harriet has asked me to be very quiet about.
