#### Evo Terra

This is the eleventh in sequence, or twelfth book. Where are we going to? Do you have a definite end point in mind?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh yes. I've known the last scene of the last book for...oh, over twenty years. I could have written it back then, and if I had done so and put it away, and then rewrote it now, the wording might change but what happens would not. There will be one more novel.

#### Evo Terra

One more.

#### Robert Jordan

One more—the twelfth book. That will be so even if that book has to be 2000 pages in hardcover, and require a luggage cart and shoulder strap to get it out of the store.

#### Evo Terra

I'm getting the feeling that you're ready to be done with this.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, it's not so much that I'm ready to be done with it, as—I think I can do it in a shorter book than that—but, you know, I set out in this thing thinking it's a 10K run, maybe a 15K, and suddenly I found out I was in a marathon. Now, if you're running a marathon, running a good 20-mile time or a good 22-mile time is all very well, but it doesn't count until you cross the finish line.

#### Evo Terra

That's exactly right. People want to know where you're going with that. And you know, you say you wrote a marathon, but actually I think you've
*defined*
the marathon. There's a lot of people trying to keep up writing series that go this long and have this kind of following.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, you know, the series going this long is a matter of me undertaking to tell more story than I thought I was setting out to tell. In the beginning, I really thought I could do it in five or six books. By the time I finished
*The Great Hunt*
I knew five or six books....it wasn't going to happen, but I didn't know how many, and for a number of books, I was frankly pulling numbers out of the air. People would ask me how many it would be, and I'd say six or seven, maybe eight, eight or nine. [laughter] Now I think I can finish it in a twelfth book, and I certainly intend to do so if I can. I believe I can.
