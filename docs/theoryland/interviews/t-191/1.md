I'm Michael R. Mennenga...

#### Evo Terra

...And my name is Evo Terra. We're joined on the phone by none other than Robert Jordan. Magical Wheel of Time series is his, and we're going to talk about the latest book which just came out not long ago called
*Knife of Dreams*
. Robert, welcome back to the show.

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you. Glad to be here.

#### Evo Terra

And it's a pleasure to have you with us again. So when last we talked, we were chatting about the prequel novel
*New Spring*
(which is also available in paperback now if you want to rush out and grab a copy of that).

#### Robert Jordan

It's available in hardcovers too!

#### Evo Terra

Oh, that's true.

#### Michael R. Mennenga

That's right!

#### Evo Terra

You can buy either copy. But
*Knife of Dreams*
is the new one, which I understand is now the eleventh sequential story in the Wheel of Time, although it's the twelfth book, since...

#### Robert Jordan

The eleventh main sequence novel, yes.

#### Evo Terra

Exactly.
