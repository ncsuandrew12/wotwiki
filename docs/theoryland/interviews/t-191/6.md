# [Interview #191: Dragon Page: 'Cover to Cover' Interview, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=191#6)

#### Evo Terra

Now, the folks at Tor, your publisher—you know, Tom Doherty and crew—have obviously stuck behind you as you've increased this from five to six books all the way to twelve.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Evo Terra

Have they been a good support all the way through?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, good support.

#### Evo Terra

Have you had the same editor all the way along?

#### Robert Jordan

I have had the same editor for every book that I have ever written with one exception. My wife Harriet is my editor. As a matter of fact, our professional relationship predates our marriage, predates our going together even. She was the editor and publisher of my first novel—
*The Fallon Blood*
, a historical novel—and it was after that was published that we began dating.

#### Michael R. Mennenga

Now,
*that*
is a brilliant move.

#### Evo Terra

I'm telling you, that's how to get an editor to do what you want. Marry them.

#### Michael R. Mennenga

That's right.

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, is that what you think? [laughter] She keeps reminding me that she knows where I sleep.

#### Evo Terra

Yeah, or it's the other way around, where that's the perfect way for the editor to get the
*writer*
what
*she*
wants him to do.

#### Michael R. Mennenga

Mmm, I wonder how that works.

#### Evo Terra

We'll leave that for speculation. We're not going to try and answer that question right here, Robert. If you don't mind, Robert, we'll take a very short break. We'll come right back and continue our conversation. We're chatting with Robert Jordan. The new book in the Wheel of Time is out, kids. It's called
*Knife of Dreams*
, and we'll be back to talk about it in just a moment, here on the Dragon Page with Michael and Evo.
