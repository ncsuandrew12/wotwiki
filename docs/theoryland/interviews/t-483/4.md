# [Interview #483: TGS Signing Report - Frenzy, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=483#4)

#### Frenzy

Tamyrlin drove Brandon all over today, and had plenty of "grilling" time.

Brandon signed my book "Would you be Nae'blis?" and Harriet signed it "For the cookie queen". (I made them both giant Aes Sedai-symbol cookies). Squee!!
