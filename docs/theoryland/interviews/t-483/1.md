# [Interview #483: TGS Signing Report - Frenzy, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=483#1)

#### Frenzy

Booksigning was awesome. I have notes, from both the signing and the dinner, but will transcribe them tomorrow. I've been up WAAAY too long to be coherent. Quick highlights:

Jason Wolfbrother and 4Alethinos were both there and both got RAFO cards.
