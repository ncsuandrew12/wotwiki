#### Question

I was wondering if we were very going to see Dragons in the Cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Dragonsteel. One of the first books I ever wrote in the Cosmere has dragons. It's also just one of the weaker books, so I can't publish it as is, but yea. Being a big fan of dragons, I did write them into the Cosmere. They are the one standard fantasy race in there.

#### Question

Are they ever going to infiltrate the other worlds kind of?

#### Brandon Sanderson
