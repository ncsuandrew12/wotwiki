#### Question

In Elantris it talks about how to wood and stone in the city is rotten and crumbling. Why does this happen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is because when objects become Invested for long periods of time their spirit web changes to accommodate the investiture. When the investiture was pulled up of the stuff in Elantris its spirit web was severely damaged so it showed that in the physical realm. This happened with the Lord Ruler when the Bands of Mourning were ripped out of him.
