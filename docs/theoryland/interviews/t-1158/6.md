#### Blightsong

Ok, first one. Was Sadeas ever affected directly by Odium or an Unmade, not counting the Thrill?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not counting the Thrill, ok uhhhhm. There are affects of other unmade around, and Odium's direct effect? I'm going to say, no, maybe some indirect effects.

#### Blightsong

What about Roshone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uhhhm, no. The Thrill is the main thing that is getting the Alethi, I mean, there are others around, but it's not as obvious with that as with other things.
