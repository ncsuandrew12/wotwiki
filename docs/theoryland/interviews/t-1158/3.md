#### Kurkistan

What exactly- When an object enters a time bubble, how exactly does it determine- how does it know how fast and which direction it's "really" going?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It gets deflected a little bit when it enters, but then it adapts to the momentum that it would have going in.

#### Kurkistan

Like Spiritual bonds to something or other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Riiight
it's- so... I can't explain that because it has relevance in the future. But in that moment when it passes [into the bubble], something is happening with conservation of momentum. The trick we have to do with it in order to keep from irradiating people.
