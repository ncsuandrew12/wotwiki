# [Interview #1158: OdysseyCon 2016, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1158#5)

#### Kurkistan

Overheard

#### Brandon Sanderson

I distinctly heard Brandon talking with the other table about space travel as relates to Roshar. He was talking about how the magic can already control gravity/pressure and the like, but the thing that stood out clearly was that he was saying that they already had an ansible.
The only candidate for that is spanreeds/conjoiner fabrials, so that's a nice confirmation there that they communicate faster than light.
