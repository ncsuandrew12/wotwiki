#### Blightsong

Is anything magical going on with the screams Szeth hears?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uhhh, Szeth's screams. Uhhm, I'm trying to decide how to answer this. It is not, see here's the thing. What we would call magical may not be considered magical in the Cosmere, but it depends on your definition of magic. Would Szeth if he were on our planet and have done those things would he hear those screams, probably not, but would someone else in the Cosmere who had gone through what he had gone through hear those screams, yes.

#### Blightsong

So it has to do with the spiritual realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yea, mhmm, yea.
