#### Blightsong

Would it be harder to soulcast a Knight Radiant?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Blightsong

Would it be harder for her to soulcast a mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, investiture disrupts investiture. It's harder for her to even soulcast a regular person than, say, a rock.

#### Blightsong

Is a Mistborn invested?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Mistborn, how their burning the metal, you're right. They are not specifically invested when they are not burning. When the investiture becomes active, the yes. Before, no, you're right on that.
