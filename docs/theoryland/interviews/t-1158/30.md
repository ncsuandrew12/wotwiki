# [Interview #1158: OdysseyCon 2016, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1158#30)

#### Blightsong

Was Hoid trying to become an Elantrian kind of in a way how Kelsier was able to connect to preservation to take up the shard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, the thing about it is your getting Hoid before he knew as much as he did in Scadrial era, so what he was trying to do was completely ineffective and it couldn't have worked.

#### Blightsong

Doesn't it get weaker the farther away you are, so it wouldn't help at all.

#### Brandon Sanderson

mhmm.

#### Question

Well we have an example of an Elantrian on Roshar, so.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes we have an Elantrian on Roshar, but we don't see him use any powers, and his skin is dark on Roshar rather than glowing. That is something to be aware of. While I keep doing this, who is here for the magic draft? \*Talks about the magic draft and his writing process for a bit\*.
