#### Blightsong

Would Hoid's spirit web seem more similar to that of a savant or a regular human?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, neither one, but it would be weirder than a savant.
Are you just getting these question's of the 17th Shard?

#### Blightsong

No, these are mine, I write questions in my notes when I read through books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

These are actually yours? Ok, I'll keep going then. If these are actually yours you can have as many as you want. Some people just go to the list of all the questions to ask Brandon and they come and just "Oh I'm just gonna ask Brandon all of these", and I'm like "no you can have three or four". But, if they're your questions you can have as many as you want.
