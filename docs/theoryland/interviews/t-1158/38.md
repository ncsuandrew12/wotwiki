# [Interview #1158: OdysseyCon 2016, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1158#38)

#### Question

So we know how people can enter Shadesmar, or the cognitive realm, how do other places, like, we haven't seen anything for the Mistborn series. Do we know how they can enter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Read Secret History.

#### Question

I did read that, but it didn't really say anything besides that one special case.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, Hoid talks about Perpendicularities on Scadrial, if you go look at that there are certain places he talks about that. ,eyes just say that large concentrations of investiture can cause a puncture through the spiritual realm straight to the physical realm. If you know how to use it, you may transition. That's not the only way but is the primary way.

#### Question

And of of Course you can soulcast (Elsecall?) to get there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Now that's a very interesting analogy you just made, you said "punctured" almost as if it were a spike.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, yes, that was intentional. Anyone who wants to ask questions after the Magic draft, you guys can come back in maybe 45 minutes. I'll just be hanging out and playing magic. If youâ€™re just here to hang out and ask question, I'll be free to do that in about 45 minutes to an hour.
