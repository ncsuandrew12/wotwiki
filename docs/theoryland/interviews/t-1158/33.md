#### Blightsong

How does corrupted investiture work, like Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Nightblood. Again, this is a definition of what somebody feels is a corruption. For instance, there are spren people would feel are corrupted. But that is corruption where the mixing of different shards has changed things, and I think a lot of times when people say corruption, people are meaning the mixing of shards powers.

#### Blightsong

So is there a mixing of shards power with Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*smirks\* RAFO. That's the natural question, I'm glad you asked it.

#### Blightsong

Ok, uhhh, so something similar is happening with Gavilar's sphere, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*contemplative silence\*, RAFO.

#### Blightsong

Uhhh, if anyone else has questions, speak up (I started running out of questions at this point).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Question over here!
