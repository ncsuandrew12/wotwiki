#### Blightsong

Can Honor spren, or any other type of Knight Radiant spren, be evil?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, because I don't call the shards good and evil. There are no good and evil shards in my opinion, like and so, what evil and what's not evil can totally have spren of honor that you would consider evil. They have free will, but they are much more limited. It is very hard, or impossible, for them to lie but they can be cruel.
