#### Blightsong

How much did Super Mind Taravangian know about the Cosmere as a whole, roughly, rough estimate.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He had a little bit of knowledge. Not as much as... not as much conscious knowledge.

#### Blightsong

Did he guess about the three realms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, he knew about the three realms. He didn't have to guess on that, he had read philosophy and things, that knowledge is there on Roshar.
