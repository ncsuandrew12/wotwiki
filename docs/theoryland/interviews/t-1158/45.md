#### Question

My friend wants to know how fast steel compounders could possibly go, can they run up walls or over water like the Flash?

#### Blightsong

\*jokingly\* Can they run through time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Steelrunners and resist a lot things due to the power, like they can withstand the Gs they are out through, but they can't ignore wind resistance and friction. They will burn up if they start running too quickly.
