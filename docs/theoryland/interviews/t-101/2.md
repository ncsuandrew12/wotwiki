# [Interview #101: TPOD Signing Report - John Hamby, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=101#2)

#### John Hamby

I was able to get a few questions in. Karl-Johan, I got a RAFO about the nature of Fain. However I think I worded the question differently than we had originally planned. Damn if I could find the paper I took notes on before I went to the signing.
