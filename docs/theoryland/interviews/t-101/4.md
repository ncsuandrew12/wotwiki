# [Interview #101: TPOD Signing Report - John Hamby, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=101#4)

#### John Hamby

And the silly trivial 'I-just-want-to-know-without-a-doubt-question', which almost got me more than I had planned.

I asked him whether Delana Mosalaine had been raised to the Hall as Sitter before the Tower split or after. Karl-Johan and Jed probably recall our analysis of the Halls a month ago.

I probably pronounced the name wrong because he just looked at me. I prompted by saying, "Delana, the Gray Sitter who we know is Black. Siuan's old friend from novicedom."

#### Robert Jordan

RJ started to say something but was trying to find the right words when I foolishly helped him out by saying, "Delana was raised at Salidar". He said yes and laughed. I tried then to follow up with asking him if she was an important aspect of Siuan's pattern in the young Sitters. RAFO was the response.
