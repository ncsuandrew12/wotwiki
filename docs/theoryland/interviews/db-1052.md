## Entry #1

#### EHyde

All right, the transcript is finished to the best of my ability. Most of the juicy questions were already in NutiketAiel's report, but if people want the exact wording, and there's some other good stuff too, especially some fun less cosmere-related stuff.

#### Footnote

This is not the general Q&A but the questions asked at the signing table. Some questions were omitted because they were reported by the people who asked the questions, in which case their paraphrases were replaced with the verbatim transcript.

## Entry #2

#### Question

Did it seem really awkward working with someone else's characters, with Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I thought that it would, but the fact that I've been reading them since I was a kid, they felt really natural to me, like writing my own characters. I'm quite pleased—I was quite surprised. Perrin and Rand and everyone, they're like my high school buddies. It was refreshingly familiar to me.

## Entry #3

#### Question

In Mistborn, Allomancy tends to get a little addictive, is that something that's going to happen with Stormlight—holding it just because it feels good?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are noticing a similarity. That is intentional.

## Entry #4

#### a young girl

How were you inspired by
*Dragonsbane*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was inspired by just how imaginative it was. I had never read a fantasy book before and I loved the idea of another world that was so similar and yet so different from our own.

#### Question (later)

When you read that one book, was that where your inspiration started, or were you always—

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was always telling stories, but I didn't find fantasy, and myself in fantasy, until I read that book.

## Entry #5

#### Question

How often do your characters take you completely by surprise when you're doing the actual writing, and take you away from your outline?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They don't surprise me very often, I'm usually aware of it long before it would actually become an issue and I've rebuilt the outline by then.

#### Question

So you're not ever in the process of writing and they—

#### Brandon Sanderson

They don't do that. I cast people in my role, like not real people but I try a character out, and if they fit the role I keep going with them and if they don't then I throw that chapter away and I cast someone else. I rarely have someone go complete crazy off what I was expecting, if they do, it means they were probably the wrong character for that role.

## Entry #6

#### Question

If Taravangian made the Diagram, and telling the future is of the Voidbringers, is that a bad sign?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on if you're speaking culturally or actually magically.

#### Question

Magically, I guess.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because he would claim to you that he did it all with strength of mind and no magical influence other than enhanced mind. That's what he would tell you. And so in that case it would not be—culturally they'd look very weirdly at it, but spiritually he would say it's not of the Voidbringers.

#### Question

Right. He would say that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh-huh.

#### Question

We were talking that it's kind of a shame that Dalinar doesn't have his own "real" spren. I think it's an upgrade, is there a way I should think of this? Is it a cool thing or a bad thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a cool thing, it's also a very dangerous thing.

#### Question

Well [the Stormfather] controls the highstorms ... follow-up question: if he dies, does that affect the spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dying, as long as the oaths are not broken, does not affect the spren in a very terrible way. There are effects.

#### bookstore employee

So, Anne McCaffrey ... what about Terry Brooks?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Terry Brooks also, but Terry Brooks was a little bit later—only six months later, but I discovered him after I was already neck-deep in the genre. I've since had dinner with him and stuff and he is delightful. [...] Landover is my favorite of his.

## Entry #9

#### Question

So regarding Hoid, are we ever going to learn his real name at any point in time? I guess in
*Dragonsteel*
? I know he says about how he's borrowing stuff and about how he steals stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. You eventually know his real name, but it depends on what you define as real.

#### Question

So also, regarding the magic systems and stuff, I hear you have another book that's unpublished and that you can send it to people.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, just drop an email, say that you want a copy of
*White Sand*
. It's okay. It's not great.

Will the flute come back?

## Entry #11

#### Leiyan

Can you tell me the order of the three planets in the solar system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Leiyan

Because I know Braize is the third one, I've heard that, is that true?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm staying closed-lipped about a lot of this.

#### Leiyan

Can you tell me which is the most massive moon [of Roshar]? Not the biggest, but the most massive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think the biggest is the most massive. All three moons are much closer than our moon is.

#### Leiyan

And so is that Nomon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Leiyan

How big is Nomon on the night sky, like compared to our moon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Larger than our moon, but not dominating of the sky. [...] I do believe Nomon is bigger, but I had to have Peter run those calculations, so he may come back and say no Brandon, that's not possible, but I do believe it's bigger than our moon in the sky. You're supposed to be able to see moderately well by Nomon.

#### Leiyan

So I had some things I figured out, I just wanted to know if they're true or not. So I have that the orbits of the moons would precess so that the farthest point is always pointing towards the sun.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, one more time.

#### Leiyan

[uses diagram to explain the question]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, we have figured all this out. It's in the wiki--so me just saying--it's not in the wiki that you can find. I would need to go compare this. All the calculations on things like this--this is stuff where I sat down with Peter, who knows much more astronomy than me and said "here's what I want" and he's like "well it has to be this" and I put that in.

#### Leiyan

Do you know, do the moons orbit the opposite direction to Roshar's rotation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe they do but I'm not 100% sure.

#### Leiyan

There's no eclipses as far as I can tell, so the plane of the orbit must be strongly inclined, 'cause there'd be an eclipse every day if there were eclipses-

#### Brandon Sanderson

We had to fudge that because as you said, if there were any it'd be all the time.

## Entry #12

#### EHyde

I was wondering, on Roshar, what sort of plants and animals do they use for fabrics, since they don't have a lot of wooly animals and the plants are different?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most of them are plant-based. I think I've mentioned one of the plants.

#### EHyde

They have silk though, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It's called sea-silk, they grow it in the water. It comes from the coasts.

#### EHyde

So they don't have anything like our silk, then?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you looked at it, you would call it silk, but it is being produced in a very different way.

#### EHyde

Our silk comes from insect cocoons, and they have a lot of that there, but they don't use it for fiber at all?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Insect cocoons on Roshar are either, they melt in water from the highstorm cycle, or they have stone in them, so they don't work really well for textiles. There are certain rockbuds you can shred the inside of the shell to get a textile, there's sea silk that grows out in the ocean, and there are other plants of a similar nature.

#### EHyde

I was also wondering about the Steel Alphabet in the Mistborn books, each letter aesthetically looks like it's built from a cuff, a spike, and a bead, and was that intentional to reflect the magic systems?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Do remember that that writing system was developed by the Final Empire. They actually took the ancient Terris symbols and made them more to their aesthetic over time.

#### Rhandric

Is Vasher trying to find Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher misses Nightblood and feels responsible for him.

#### Rhandric

How many worldhoppers have we seen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I haven't kept track, you've seen quite a few. There's one from Mistborn, did you catch him? I don't think people have really picked out the Terriswoman yet, who makes her way into them, but they're mostly not supposed to be noticeable yet, until you get to know them as characters and you look back and be like "oh that was that person."

#### Rhandric

Is it the Terriswoman I think it is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know which Terriswoman you think it is.

#### Rhandric

Tindwyl?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Kurkistan

Speaking of the Terriswoman, is she the nurse in
*Warbreaker*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

< Pauses; gleefully says > RAAAAAAFO!

## Entry #14

#### Question

Do you have any say in your covers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have a lot more than I used to. Originally, not much, though Tor, to their credit, even the first cover asked me—gave me a choice of three illustrators, and said "which of these three would you like the most? And then I picked Stephan Martiniere, and I got the cover from him, that I really liked. Nowadays I can say "give me this artist" and they do.

## Entry #15

#### Question

Have you thought any more about metal allergies with your Allomancy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It definitely wouldn't be pleasant.

#### Question

Ok, I have this steel allergy, I got it last year, and I work in a steel plant.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would not be pleasant, but I would have the instinct that fewer people on Scadrial would have that allergy, because of the Investiture during their creation. But, it could totally happen.

#### Question

I really like the leatherbound—are these [the Stormlight Archive] ever going to come out in a leatherbound edition?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would assume that someday we will make that happen, but it is not in the near future. You'll probably see a Mistborn leatherbound first. To kind of gauge the market.

## Entry #17

#### Question

You said you've played Magic since it came out, what kind do you play the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I play draft the most right now, particularly cube draft, but any sort of draft I can be a part of I love. [...] And you know, any time I can play I enjoy it, but if there's a set that I can draft some sort of screwy combo deck like spider spawning or swarm or something, then that's the sort of set I love. Or some sort of screwy five color deck.

#### Question

I play a lot of commander.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Every time I play commander I get stomped. I haven't quite figured out how to make a commander deck that doesn't get stomped. But of course I think that the format's all about everyone getting stomped so, it makes sense.

#### 8-year-old girl

When is the next Alcatraz book coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am working on it right now, I hope to have it out by next year. I'm not sure when, but hopefully next year. [...] I did buy [the rights] back and I sold them to Tor, who's releasing a new edition, so you won't have to order them in from the UK anymore. [...] We will have a Tor edition starting in 2015, hopefully with the last book.

Since the evil on Threnody isn't a Shard, can you tell us anything about its actual nature? Is it an actual being, and is it related to Adonalsium?

Everything is related to Adonalsium in the Cosmere, most of the magic you're seeing is a just a natural outgrowth of Cosmere related magic and cognitive shadows. The Evil is similarly related.

#### RIT

Alright, glowing Shardplate and retractable helmets. Is that a similar origin of the Shardblades—

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's a similarity, but they are also very different.

#### RIT

Yeah, I noticed they do seem like advanced fabrials, because Adolin just keeps going on and on about how they're all interchangeable and how they all feel comfortable after a while, and it doesn't have the same kind of thing with the Shardblades.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it doesn't. Though a Shardblade, used for a long time, will change shape slightly.

Is it the power of the bond between humans and spren, the Nahel bond, or from the swords—the existing Shardblades—that causes the eyes to turn light?

Does each specific order have their own spren that they would bond?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Each order has a spren that is distinctive. All Windrunners come from wind— from honorspren.

#### Question

You talk about music a lot in your books, but you never talk about the notation, or how advanced they've come with the chords and scales and stuff, do you have that all planned out or is that just—

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have an idea in my head, but it's not something I spend a lot of time worldbuilding. [...] I play trumpet, not piano, so my music theory is all squished through brass, which leaves me with kind of a weird perspective on it. My wife did music theory, and played piano, and all this stuff, and me it's like, you know, "it comes out the front of the horn!"

#### Footnote

Music theory is generally easiest for pianists because they play more than one note at a time (as many as 11-12), and can play several voices in counterpoint with each other. Trumpet players often can't even read bass clef; pianists read both clefs and more commonly have the ability to play in any key.

#### Question

So, Joshua [Bilmes ha]s looked at two of my manuscripts, how many did he look at of yours before—?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think he looked at four. [...] If you're continuing to get better and better feedbacks, that's a really good sign with Joshua. Now, you should also be sending other places. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. But as long as you're getting increasingly good feedback, then he's paying attention, and he doesn't read a lot of new authors' work anymore, he has his assistants do that, so if he is reading it himself (and if he says he is, he is) then you are in a good position.

I will tie them in. I've already seeded hidden things that I can use to tie them in the way I want to. So it should all be there, the things I want to use. When you read, watch for a character named Hoid.

We'll see. We will see. The thing is there's a beginning, middle, and end to the shattering of Adonalsium and the involvement there. More stories can be told in the Cosmere, but there's a beginning, middle, and end to that. When I finish that, that is the sequence that I wanted to tell.

No, it took a while to kind of figure out, all of this took a while to figure out, none of it came, I had to practice, I had to learn, and this is just kind of my philosophies as I write.

#### Question

Are the Wax and Wayne stories going to always be in stand-alone, or are they ever going to tie in to the main Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They will tie in, in fact I intended the first one to foreshadow stuff for the next trilogy, so you will find things tying in with what's going on, but I kind of wanted them to just be more independent, so we'll see. It'll be a little of both.

Kaladin in the second book seemed to be a different Kaladin than at the end of the first book.

#### Question

Angrier, and my question is, why did you write him that way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He has always been angry. In the first book, he is focused on saving his men and now that his men are safe, all of those emotions—if you go look at him from the first nine chapters of
*Way of Kings*
, he's that way there, it's when he becomes focused on saving his men he has something to drive him and it kind of subsumes these things, but once they're safe all these things he hasn't dealt with came back out.

#### Question

Birthright.

Ah ...

#### Question

So I've been in contact a little bit with [something], I own a RP gamer, and they went radio silence on me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yeah. I had dinner with Matt Scott like two weeks ago, he said it's still in development, but he's like buying a game studio that was working on it, or something? He had farmed it out? I think. So I don't know.

#### Question

Are you still writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wrote the story for them to use. The idea was I write the story, they build the game, and come back to me for dialogue. So I have got an overarching story for them but I don't write the dialogue till we actually have a game to plug things into. That's still my plan. He's still really interested in buying the Mistborn movie option, and he says that he's working on a mobile game, so he's really awesome ... but I have nothing to tell you right now.

#### Question

The epigraphs for The Way of Kings, that were talking about how the various Shardholders are influenced by their shards over time--how does that impact someone like Harmony, with multiple shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The main effect it's having on Harmony right now is his inability to act sometimes, because his two sides are pushing, and so he is having trouble being proactive. It'd take a long time before it really becomes manifest, but he's had several hundred years, so it's starting to have an effect.

Do you know if Graphic Audio is ever going to tackle the Stormlight Archive?

I would like them to, but it's really up to Tor Audio, or actually MacMillian Audio. They are the ones, because we sold the audio rights to them, that would decide when they're going to do subsidiary licenses. Which they only recently decided on Mistborn. So I'm sure Graphic Audio would like to do it, probably after a few books of this are out they'll start doing it.

What Jasnah did, in the first book, with Shallan in the alleyway. And what happened at the end of this book, between Adolin and the other character. Would you put them on the same level? Or would you say that what Adolin did was maybe a little bit darker?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that what Adolin did was less dark, personally. I would say that what Adolin did was something that needed to be done, that no one else was capable of doing.

#### Question

Will it have any ramifications for him down the line? With how it was handled?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, there are definitely ramifications. How it's handled, there's lots of ramifications. And there are certain characters who would think that what he did is totally, totally, totally wrong.

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Then … a Mistborn burning atium is really hard to beat in any other way.

#### Question

So you think that Kelsier would beat Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Kelsier would beat Vin if he had atium and she didn't. If they both did? Vin has more raw talent, Kelsier has more experience. So if you can pick Vin after she has more experience she will give him a fair fight, otherwise, not.

#### Question

If someone--Vasher says that Nightblood would kill him, is that just because he has this big deific Breath? Would it kill an ordinary person, like a drab?

It would suck the Breath from anybody, and if they were unable to feed it he would feed on their soul.

So they would die.

Yes. Anybody wielding Nightblood, he will suck their soul. For too long, he will eventually, if you draw him, he will suck your soul.

#### Question

When does a person become a Surgebinder? Because Kaladin talks about when he was a child, about it being a familiar feeling, and Shallan obviously was younger. Or is it when they speak the Words?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The bond starts forming before the words are spoken, but if the words are never spoken that bond will eventually evaporate and get broken. But the bond will start forming before. Just like an emotion attracts a spren, acting in the way that the spren you would eventually bond will start drawing them toward you and that will start to create that bond.

#### Question

And is Stormlight the same?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Stormlight is the same. Good questions!

#### Question

Would Vasher be able to use Stormlight in the same way that he can get Breath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would not be immediately easy, but Stormlight could feed Nightblood.

#### Question

Which is why Szeth can wield Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Eh, you'll have to see if … but yes. That could theoretically happen. You can use most of the magics on most of the planets to fuel the other magics, if you know how to do it, it is not easy.

It has two. The original working title was Stones Unhallowed. However, Rothfuss is using Doors of Stone, and I kind of feel like I might want to do something different, so my interim title is Skybreaker, but it has to be an in-world book. The in-world book for book 3 is kind of a different one, so I can do a lot with it, but Stones Unhallowed is easier.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They were crafted before Shardblades existed, and all Shardblades that exist came about as certain individuals trying to find out how to copy Honorblades.

#### Leiyan

So would it be fair to say that Honorblades are analagous to fabrials in some sense? Trap spren in a crystal yada yada Stormlight power?

How many magic systems are there on Roshar?

It depends on your definition. Is Windrunning its own magic system, or is it a division of a larger magic system? Are the ten different Surges each their own magic system, or are they all the same one?

#### Rhandric

If you assume the surges are all one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well then you would have Surgebinding, and the Old Magic, those are two at least, and there are things that are not explained in those at all, and how do you count creating fabrials? Is that a science and not a magic? Is that its own magic system?

#### Rhandric

It's a science, because anyone can do it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So Awakening is not a magic, then? Awakening's a science? Because anyone can Awaken if they get the breath.

#### Rhandric

That's something that stood out to me, because in all your other magic systems that we've seen so far there has to be some sort of snapping to occur, and that's unique, because- [...] Is there an active magic system on Threnody?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Threnody has a non Shard-based...it depends on what you call a magic system. Do spirits coming back from the dead count as magic? It's science to them, but, it's goofy science.
