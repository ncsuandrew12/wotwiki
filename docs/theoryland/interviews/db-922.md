## Entry #1

#### s'rEDIT

The one thing at the signing that surprised me at the time, but after consideration later did not surprise me at all, was that someone asked the question, "Who killed Asmodean?"

Really, after all this time?

But "The Bug" and his mom and I agreed later that the person who asked it was just being intentionally facetious.

We'll see what Free's take on it is soon. Harriet's immediate response was it is a lesson on how one should always read the Glossary.

Overall, it was a great experience. Brandon and Harriet were obviously quite comfortable with the fans and each other. And both were enthusiastic, articulate, and . . . funny!

By the way, I love the little pre-printed R.A.F.O. cards, although only one person's question earned a card last night.

Maybe insectoid or Freelancer's reports will remind me of something else.

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet confirmed that YES there would definitely be a new Encyclopedia of WOT. And also that it would be illustrated! She didn't say whether an illustrator had been chosen (I don't think so, anyway . . . Free? insectoid?).
