# [Interview #870: Brandon Sanderson: "I was absolutely stunned" when asked to finish The Wheel of Time, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=870#2)

#### Ed Huyck

Brandon Sanderson was a rising star in the fantasy field when in 2007, he was chosen to complete The Wheel of Time, a massive, landmark series that had legions of dedicated fans waiting for the finale. The series' creator Jim Rigney (writing as Robert Jordan) had died with the series unfinished, leaving behind a couple hundred pages of notes for what he had thought would be the final volume.

In the end, it took Sanderson three volumes to wrap up the series. The eagerly anticipated final book,
*A Memory of Light*
, arrives on bookshelves this week. Sanderson and series editor, Harriet McDougal (who is also Rigney's widow), will be at the Har Mar Barnes and Noble this Tuesday for a talk and signing.

The author took some time from his busy schedule to answer a few questions about coming to the end of the task, and what fans can expect in
*A Memory of Light*
.
