# [Interview #870, Entry #7]: Brandon Sanderson: "I was absolutely stunned" when asked to finish The Wheel of Time](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=870#7)

#### Ed Huyck

Are we going to be happy with the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The ending was written by Robert Jordan, and as a reader I found it extremely satisfying when I reached it. And so I feel very confident that the ending of the book is going to be what everyone has been hoping for and wantingâ€”without being exactly what they expect. I think the ending that Robert Jordan wrote is just wonderful.
