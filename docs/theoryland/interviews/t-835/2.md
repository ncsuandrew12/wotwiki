# [Interview #835: KOD Signing Report - Byryn, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=835#2)

#### Byryn

Anyhow, I as I was getting my book signed I asked Mr. Jordan flat out (with a smile), "So are you going to reveal who killed him by the end? Or are you going to let us stew forever?"

#### Robert Jordan

He said that if the natural course of the story brings him there, he will answer that question. But if he doesn't include it, he promised that he will reveal the killer by the time the paperback of the last book comes out.
