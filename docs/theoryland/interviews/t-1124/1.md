#### Leinton

Of all the published shardworlds, which one is your favorite to write and which would you want to live on.

#### Brandon Sanderson

One he wants to live on would definitely be Scadrial, because they have running water and electricity. Favorite to write is Roshar. He would not want to live on any of them though because they don't have internet or delivery pizza. (He later stated that delivery pizza would likely be a thing Scadrial would get, but that it would not be delivered via coinshots becaues they were too expensive).
