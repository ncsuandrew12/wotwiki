Here's some stuff I forgot that is somewhat important.

#### Robert Jordan

He gave some new information on the Shipwreck series, he now plans to have just one continent, like Pangaea, with a Seanchan-like civilisation on one side and a European on the other. There is trade between the two, but across the sea, not the land, and the trading is never direct, but passes through many hands along the way. Therefore, the people on either side of the continent have no idea what the other is like.
