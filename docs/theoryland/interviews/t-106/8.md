#### Mark Erikson

That's pretty much it, I just wanted to write it all out before I forgot half of it in my sleep. If it seems a bit garbled, I'll have a better version on my homepage late tomorrow.

Finally, I think it's safe to say that I have the only first edition signed hardcover print of
*The Path of Daggers*
in Australia. Not a great achievement, but an achievement nonetheless.
