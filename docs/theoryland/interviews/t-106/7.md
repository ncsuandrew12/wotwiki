# [Interview #106: Melbourne Film Festival - Mark Erikson, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=106#7)

#### Robert Jordan

I'm fairly sure he's done this before, but he said Aginor and Balthamel are Aran'gar and Osan'gar, and he also said that Terry Goodkind actually uses WOT as inspiration, instead of going to a historical source. He sounded serious.

was

good.
