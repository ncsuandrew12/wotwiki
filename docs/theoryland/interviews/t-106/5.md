# [Interview #106: Melbourne Film Festival - Mark Erikson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=106#5)

#### Mark Erikson

Other than that, we just chatted about his life.

#### Robert Jordan

I asked him about the Vietnam War, and found out that he was a cold blooded killer in his youth, and he smoked a lot of pot. He even said that during that time he had someone trying to kill him, personally, and I got the distinct impression that it was someone on his own side. He said his nickname was 'The Iceman'.
