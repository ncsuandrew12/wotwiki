# [Interview #106: Melbourne Film Festival - Mark Erikson, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=106#2)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked him about Aginor getting younger at the end of
*The Eye of the World*
, and he said 'no, he doesn't get younger, he dies'. So I actually looked up the reference and read it to him. He said 'oh, that,' and then went on to explain that it is actually the True Power, not the
*saidin*
from the Eye, that rejuvenates him. He did describe the
*saidin*
in the Eye as a 'mother-lode', however, I didn't think to ask him what he meant by that until I was in the car going home. I instead asked him whether the True Power was the source of the Forsaken's immortality. He said: yes.

#### MARK ERIKSON

Initially I asked 'In the end of
*Eye of the World*
, when Rand is fighting Aginor, why did Aginor get younger?'

#### ROBERT JORDAN

RJ replied 'He didn't, he died there. Do you mean the resurrection? He and Balthamel got resurrected in
*Lord of Chaos*
.'

#### MARK ERIKSON

I said 'I know that, but....' and couldn't think of anything else. I thought I must have read that part wrong, so while other people were having their books signed, I went through the book and found the line, and read it to him.

#### ROBERT JORDAN

RJ said 'Oh that. That's actually the power of the Dark One rejuvenating him,' and went on to basically explain what the True Power is, like I was an idiot.

#### MARK ERIKSON

So then I said 'So is the True Power the source of their immortality?'

#### ROBERT JORDAN

And he said 'Effectively, yes.'

#### Footnote

Some fans picked this line of questioning up in
[Budapest in 2003](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183)
, and RJ said that the Forsaken are not actually immortal; they have merely been promised immortality after the Day of Return. RJ probably meant that the True Power is what kept them alive all the years they were sealed in the Bore.
