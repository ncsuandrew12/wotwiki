# [Interview #106, Entry #6]: Melbourne Film Festival - Mark Erikson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=106#6)

#### Robert Jordan

We talked about touring, I asked him whether his signature ever got wobbly, and he said he had it down to a fine art, and could do 1200 sigs in 90 minutes. He went right off at John Grisham when he found out the first edition of his first book was worth $450,000, and I told him I felt the same way about Sara Douglass. After hearing my criticisms, he decided that he'd have to read them, so he bought the books there and then.
