# [Interview #106: Melbourne Film Festival - Mark Erikson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=106#1)

#### Mark Erikson

This is just a brief summary of what went on at the Melbourne Book signing, I'll put a full write up in as the next Erikson Diary on my homepage tomorrow.

First, Novak, there was no need for me to ask if I could stand around and write stuff down, because it was only a small crowd, and I could hear everything while I was waiting in line. Then, when he'd signed everyone's books, we got to just hang around and ask him questions for about an hour and a half. However, nobody else there was on the Usenet, so not much of the actual discussion was plot related.
