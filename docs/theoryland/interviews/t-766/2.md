# [Interview #766, Entry #2]: A Memory of Light Cover Art Round-Up](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=766#2)

#### Irene Gallo

We are very excited to reveal the cover to
[*A Memory of Light*](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-memory-of-light-robert-jordan/1109624139?ean=9780765325952&wbtrak=NGZhYWY3M2MtNjAxMzY2Mjg=)
, the final volume of Robert Jordan’s epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time. The artwork for this final edition is by, arguably, one of today’s most beloved illustrators,
[Michael Whelan](http://www.glassonion.com/?wbtrak=NGZhYWY3M2MtNjAxMzY2Mjg=)
.

The task of jumping into a 14 volume series on its last installment must have been a daunting one but Michael rose to the occasion. Harriet McDougal, Jordan’s editor and widow remarked, "that is the Rand I have waited to see for twenty years” when she saw the image. And while the artwork clearly has all the earmarks of a Whelan painting, its theme and coloration make it a fitting heir to Darrell K. Sweet’s series of Wheel of Time covers.

In keeping with the series’ covers, the scene gathers elements from a key scene in the book. Here, Rand stands with
*Callandor*
on the rocks of Shayol Ghul, heading down into its depths to confront the Dark One even as the sun itself vanishes from the world. Two Aes Sedai follow the Dragon Reborn into the mouth of darkness, two women who have been with Rand since the very beginning.
