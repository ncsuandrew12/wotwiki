## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#1)

#### Zas678

Hello Fellow Sharders!
So today, Brandon answered several questions on twitter.com during a #torchat, and there are quite a few interesting questions. When I orignially saw it, I panicked a bit,but thankfully the Inseperable Peter Ahlstrom came to the rescue and posted Brandon's tweets for the past two weeks today. Thanks Peter!

#### Footnote

Only the Cosmere and Brandon questions are on here. The WoT questions are in the Twitter WoT 2011 thread.

I messaged earlier regarding
*Alloy of Law*
appendix narrator, unaware of today's torchat. maybe you can respond in the chat?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136140626730299393)

I haven't been telling people the name of the appendix author. It is either Hoid or one of the 17th sharders.

#### [gmreynoldsjr (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/gmreynoldsjr/status/136141396401856513)

What are keys to balance family, writing career?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136142437528764417)

Good question. I had to make certain hours of the day "off limits" for writing, so that I didn't feel I was missing out on writing time. I could ALWAYS be working, but that's not good emotionally or for the family.

Otherwise, I try to make my writing time as effective as possible, so I don't feel that sense of "I didn't get anything done."

That one makes me unbalanced, as I feel anxious if I haven't gotten some good work done in a day.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#4)

#### [justinkjeppesen (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/justinkjeppesen/status/136141653722415104)

Any suggestions for finding time to write for a full time dad with a full time non-writing job?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136143567352639488)

It depends on whether or not your day job is creatively draining. If it is writing/programming, etc (more)

You'll have a much harder time, as those jobs flex the same muscles as novel writing.

The people I've known who do it tend to get up an hour early, before their brain is worn out, and write then.

Basically, you'll have to give something up. Television, video games, golf, something. (But not family time.)

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#5)

#### [CorbyCampbell (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/CorbyCampbell/status/136142096213094400)

Your side characters often have physical infirmities. Can you explain why?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136144617165950976)

I feel that often, fiction tends to gloss over or ignore people like Clubs. So I find myself sticking them in.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#6)

#### [ateistcanuck (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/atheistcanuck/status/136142520370466816)

Was Bloody Tan an atium misting?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136145511269941250)

No, he was not. Good question.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#7)

#### [seaksstamp (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/seaksstamp/status/136142522144653312)

What is your favorite book you've written?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136145655604322304)

Favorite is hard to pin down. I'm most proud of either
*The Gathering Storm*
or
*The Way of Kings*
, as they were among the hardest and most satisfying.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#8)

#### [derek\_downey (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/derek_downey/status/136142882716401664)

Do you read ebooks or are you a purist (Have to have the physical book)?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136146638187134976)

I prefer to read physical when I am at home, and ebook when I'm on the road. (Like now.)

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#9)

#### [Imriyalde (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/Imriyalde/status/136142971497226240)

Do you have a trick for plowing through writer's block?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136146973744054273)

Yes. I just write anyway, telling myself I don't have to use what I write. I write it poorly, then try again.

For me, that gets my brain working. You can't be afraid to 'throw away' what you've done for a day and try again.

With that in mind, you can have the most random of things happen, knowing you won't keep them. Just to get jump-started.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#10)

#### [valveriefrankel (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/valeriefrankel/status/136145086814748672)

What's your favorite book of all time?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136147433045504000)

Probably
*Les Miserables*
. Hope I spelled that right . . .

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#11)

#### [spencerpanger (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/spencerpanger/status/136145158159876096)

Is the recipient of the letter in
*Way of Kings*
also in Dragonsteel?

#### [Brandon on Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136147531418710016)

Yes. (Good question.)

#### SPENCERPANGER

If so would it be the person that Topaz gets mad at?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

RAFO on the second one. I've already given you too much!

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#12)

#### [ericpeters (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/ericpeters/status/136145181744435201)

You mentioned friday night in #Seattle Allomacy has "FTL" built into it, any more hints you can share on how that would work

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136147712243548160)

It involves where the lost energy from thermodynamic issues goes in certain Allomantic interactions.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#13)

#### [justin\_9e (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/justin_9e/status/136145257585836032)

What was one of the first novels you read as a child?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136147941265129472)

First real fantasy novel was
*Dragonsbane*
. As a young child, I really liked the 3 Investigators books.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#14)

#### [pchobbit (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/pchobbit/status/136145293472309248)

Did you ever study a martial art yourself? Did studying a foreign language change the way you write?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136148175785431040)

My only martial arts study comes from reading and watching, with the occasional 'one shot' go learn some basics.

Studying a foreign language was extremely helpful in opening my eyes to other cultures, and my own language.

Brandon kearned Korean for his LDS mission when he was in college.

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#15)

#### [CorbyCampbell (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/CorbyCampbell/status/136145332152176640)

do you decide what cosmere hints you'll let out before going to events? Or just decide on the fly?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136148399673196545)

A little of both. Usually, they pry more out of me than I'm planning, though.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#16)

#### [tritlo (14 November 2011)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/93/http//twitter.com/tritlo/status/136147246138929152)

Another question, do you think you'll eventually publish a "The World of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere"?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136148774543298560)

Probably. Though first, we'd probably do
*The Way of Kings*
and Mistborn worldbooks.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#17)

#### [ford\_thomas (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/ford_thomas/status/136147925226098688)

Do you have plans to continue stories in the
*Elantris*
(hope I spelled that right) world?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136150291241381888)

Yes. I hope to write a sequel for the 10th anniversary of the book's release, which would be 2015.

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#18)

#### [tritlo (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/tritlo/status/136148097612005376)

how is it that you've become so skilled? Lots of study and practice?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136150423315812352)

You've got it. Practice and study. I wrote 13 novels before publishing one (my sixth.) Practice, practice, practice.

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#19)

#### [ericpeters (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/ericpeters/status/136148413464059904)

What exactly is a dueling cane anyhow?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136150651527892992)

Depends. Some are flexible, like sparring swords, and are used for duels where blood is not needed.

Others are basically a big length of wood for hitting people, like a tonfa without the grip.

#### ERICPETERS

Do canes have a hilt like a sparring sword then? I always picture something like
pic
being used

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Many have a hilt. However for most, there is no crossguard or the like.

And most don't taper like that one. They are often of a uniform diameter all the way down.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#20)

#### [GabrielRumbaut (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/GabrielRumbaut/status/136148581236211712)

How "bad" are your first drafts? Many authors say their first draft of a novel is always terrible.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136150923041980417)

They're pretty bad. In a first draft, I focus on character arcs and laying down dialogue.

So the descriptions are sparse, and often they're overly wordy to a huge fault. Drafts streamline.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#21)

#### [athenainlove (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/athenainlove/status/136148617600843776)

Which author would you like to meet and get a book signed by him/her?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136151106010095616)

Alive? Terry Practhett. Dead? Robert Jordan.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#22)

#### [EricLake (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/EricLake/status/136148936556683264)

Is Endowment's holder female?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136151230874525697)

RAFO :)

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#23)

#### [blan\_Ryan7 (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/blan_Ryan7/status/136151752926953472)

Loved
*Way of Kings*
; can you say where shardblades go when not summoned or is it a RAFO?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136152383641227264)

It is RAFO, but one that will be answered for sure.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#24)

#### [Shadowsofink (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/Shadowsofink/status/136149819336040448)

Complex "magic" system in Mistborn, and the complex one in
*Elantris*
; what base ideas do you build from for this?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Mon Nov 14)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136152632204075008)

For Mistborn, Alchemy and biological metabolism. For
*Elantris*
, Chinese linguistics and geometry mixed.

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#25)

#### [irotin (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/irothtin/status/136150213458001920)

Kel said he ended atium production for a few hundred years. Will atium reappear in
*Alloy*
and such, or did Sazed move the Pits?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Mon Nov 14)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136152977961533441)

RAFO. :)

## [Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#26)

#### [Fyodor32768 (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/Fyodor32768/status/136150583437557760)

In
*Alloy of Law*
are people still Snapping?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136153689038659584)

Sazed chose to alter the way Snapping works. It bothered him. It does happen, but differently.

## [Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#27)

#### [Frodor32768 (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/Fyodor32768/status/136150993812471809)

it seems that The Lord Ruler still needed to store age "normally" but less. Did Miles ever have to store healing?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136153799986380801)

Yes. He did, but not in the normal way.

## [Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#28)

#### [BenjaminSRawlin (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BenjaminSRawlin/status/136151522189914112)

how old were you when you first started writing? any advice for young writers, given economy at the moment?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136154355941384192)

I started at age 15 or 16, but didn't finish a novel until in my 20s. As for new writers, don't worry about the money.

It will probably take a few years to get published, or to be making money, so focus on the craft first.

Think of becoming a writer like becoming a doctor. It can take 6-8 yrs. Who knows what the economy will be like?

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#29)

#### [RachelxRussell (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/RachelxRussell/status/136151552342753280)

How does your approach differ in writing science fiction and then fantasy? Both stylistically and conceptually.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136154710498480128)

For SF I take many more things for granted, meaning I focus more on story and less on worldbuilding.

In SF, I will also generally focus on a handful of ideas instead of a whole ton of them.

This usually makes my sf shorter than my fantasy.

## [Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#30)

#### [keebler980 (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/keebler980/status/136152114677288960)

I like that you are very involved with the fans. I want to start reading your books. What's the first one to start with?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136156345408823296)

If you want more action, Mistborn. If you want a slower, more thoughtful pace,
*Elantris*
. Thanks!

## [Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#31)

#### [GabrielRumbaut (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/GabrielRumbaut/status/136152277646983168)

I know you plan your plot beforehand, but do you ever find yourself changing parts of your plot in rewrites?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136156521695412224)

Frequently. Even a heavy outliner can't be afraid to change the story at any point in the process.

## [Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#32)

#### [CorbyCampbell (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/CorbyCampbell/status/136153965153878016)

'IronEyes' at the end of
*Alloy of Law*
is actually Marsh? It could be any kandra could it not?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136157131647893504)

It could be a kandra, but I will tell you specifically that this time it is not. It is him.

## [Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=704#33)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136157454940651520)

I'm very sorry, but I do have to stop. I'll try to get to other questions later. Thanks for your participation, and for reading!
