# [Interview #213: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER, IT SEEMS, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=213#5)

#### Robert Jordan

For Dracos, the Forsaken could not talk to one another, not even Balthamel and Aginor, who were trapped near the surface and at least intermittently conscious and aware what was happening in the world. You might say that being trapped where they were, in a Bore that existed everywhere at once, allowed them to see the whole world. But for the others, it was a deep and dreamless sleep. Even for Ishamael, except when he was spun out periodically. When thinking about the Forsaken, you might factor in the effects of dream deprivation.
