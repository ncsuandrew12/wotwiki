# [Interview #213: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER, IT SEEMS, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=213#8)

#### Robert Jordan

For Roland Arien, a lot of people have asked questions about Alric's death. I should have made matters plainer. As I envisioned it, Alric, having sensed Siuan's extreme shock, came running to her and arrived just in time to be stabbed just before Siuan was taken into the anteroom. She should have sensed the knife going in, but that was masked by her shock. When she sees him lying there, he is dying, though not yet dead. As I said, I should have made it plainer.
