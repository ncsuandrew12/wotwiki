# [Interview #213: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER, IT SEEMS, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=213#10)

#### Robert Jordan

For Mark A, there are plenty of reasons for men and women to have a certain degree of distrust, though the fact that many Aes Sedai have Warders and good relationships with them shows that it isn't all mistrust. How much trust do most men and women have for the opposite gender here and now? I trust Harriet with my life, but look at how most people are. Look at most women's views of men, and most men's views of women. There is a lot of distrust right there. As for the Forsaken, they don't trust anybody. Gender doesn't enter into it.
