Two more Writing Excuses podcast episodes are up. The first covers what we call
[the problem of originality](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/07/02/)

[Glamour in Glass.](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/07/08/)
(Earlier we did the same thing with my novel
[The Way of Kings](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/06/10/)
and Howard's graphic novel volume
[Force Multiplication](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/05/20/)
.)
