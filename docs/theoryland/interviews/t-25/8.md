# [Interview #25: LOC Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=25#8)

#### Erica Sadun

Did not get a chance to ask:

1. Why did Ishamael split in two at the end of
*The Dragon Reborn*
?
  
2. Who was Kari al'Thor? And what did it mean to be Second Captain in Illian?
  
3. Is Egwene the reincarnation of Eldrene of Manetheren? And is Eldrene's veil significant? Will you explore Egwene's understanding of the Old Tongue at all?
  
4. Was Lews Therin Beidomon?
  
5. What did your readers guess that you thought they'd never pick up on because you thought it was too subtle?
  
6. Why do some characters go in and out of the woodwork? Like Rand in
*The Dragon Reborn*
...
  
7. What made you choose to have a protagonist who will be going mad?

Please
*do*
identify yourself as a 'net Darkfriend. He seems to like us, be aware of us, etc. And Judy: "All is forgiven".
