Blarg. This chapter is giving me all kinds of grief. Maybe I should just cut the whole thing. (Kidding.)

By the way, 17% cut from the first chapter I did today and 7% cut from the next one. 75% done, about 34k words cut from the book so far.

Well, 1% cut from that chapter. I had a request from Maria to add in a large chunk, which was the right suggestion.
