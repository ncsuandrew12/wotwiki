All right. Sunday's over, and the last push has begun. Book is due ASAP. Let's get this thing done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21296928956)

75% of the final rewrite of
*Towers of Midnight*
is done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21302750062)

78%. Normally, 4:00 would be time to go to bed, but I took a nap today to get me ready for the long haul. Onward we go, then.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21311170466)

At about 85% from the work over night. Is that the sun? Hello.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21324173249)

At the 90% mark on the
*Towers of Midnight*
final draft.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21336612420)

Still here. 93%. Going a little slower than I was earlier in the night, but still determined to make deadline.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21339350691)

94% And a thunderstorm rolls past. (looks upward.) Thanks. Very narratively appropriate.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21340487811)

95% done. Note: though it seems I'm coming down to the wire, know that if I weren't confident the book were right, I'd have pulled it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21340564195)

I went into this revision knowing that we were almost there. I wouldn't release the book at almost, though, regardless of consequences.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21341993352)

96% I am feeling very good about the things I have fixed in this draft. This is going to be a great book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21344466502)

97% done. The end is in sight, folks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21346987293)

98%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21348520300)

99%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21350398138)

Ladies and gentlemen...last draft is done.
*Towers of Midnight*
is set for an on-time release, November 2nd.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21352347708)

And it is off. Last draft sent to Team Jordan for a final review. They will have some final questions/tweaks for me when I wake up.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21352403630)

I will do those tonight after I wake up from crashing, then will send the book to Tor so it is in by the time people get to work tomorrow.
