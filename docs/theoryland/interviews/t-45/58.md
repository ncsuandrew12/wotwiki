# [Interview #45, Entry #58]: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#58)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (28 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19719243933)

Chapter 66 increased in size by 2.5%. (Really, more like it increased by 10%, then I cut the chapter down.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19724167430)

Whew. 67 edited. That took a lot of work. A lot added, a lot cut. End result: Cut by 7.8%. 3 chapters and epilogue left. (About 100 pgs.)

Heh. Line from
*Towers of Midnight*
said: "And Rand did such and such." Brain keeps reading "Ayn Rand." Did Goodkind sneak over and rewrite my manuscript?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19774838304)

5% cut from the last of the three 'Needs special attention" chapters I just revised, added to, and edited. Gets easier from here out.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19776935603)

These are manuscript pages, so in print, that would be more like 50 pages.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19779306131)

Typed in new wordcount for chapter. Excel spreadsheet responds: Chapter size increased by 748%. Uh, think I left a number off somewhere...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19779362207)

After a typo fix in the spreadsheet: Chapter 69 cut by 15.2%. 50 [manuscript] pages left to revise.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19789194845)

Before I left, I almost got chapter 70 done. Finished now, 4% cut. I've been over it often in other drafts, and didn't need as much a trim.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19789418947)

Onward to the epilogue; it's 6k words long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19791603284)

12% cut from first scene of the epilogue. Five to go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19792591776)

6.8% cut from the next scene. Four to go.

#### [BRANDON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19793702769)

Well, look at this. One last person in the epilogue I forgot to name. Glenn Bergevin. You're in. 7% cut from the scene you are in.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19794421758)

13.9%. Two short scenes left.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19795068994)

12.2%. One more to go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19796076216)

And...13.4% from the last scene. Book length is 320,286 words. 42,614 words cut. 11.7%. About 5k more than
*Knife of Dreams*
; 4th longest in the series.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19796173105)

Hold off on celebrating TOO much, though. Needs a spellcheck, and a spot fix some problems Team Jordan has mentioned about earlier chapters.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19796402554)

Then it gets sent to a secret cabal of beta readers (no, you can't join them. Sorry.) I spot fix problems they find, then a last quick draft.
