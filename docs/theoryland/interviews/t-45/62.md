Okay, up bright and early (well, for me) and starting work on the
*Towers of Midnight*
final draft. Need to do 10% of it today at the minimum.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20739140343)

A visit from an old friend from out of town slowed me, but I'm back on track. 1% down so far. Going to be a long week...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20753458300)

5% done. At least that much left to go today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20759772507)

Okay, 6%. Hit a little patch that needed some extra work, thought, and rewriting. Pleased with it now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20770820359)

9% done on the last
*Towers of Midnight*
revision. Looking good, though Peter tells me I should try for 14% a day if I want to hit Monday's goal.
