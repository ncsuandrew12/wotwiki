Man, it's been too long since I read through the WoT straight through. Elyas snuck up on Gaul? Totally forgot about that moment.

That might be the most challenging part of writing these books—the need to constantly be re-reading the originals to keep myself accurate.

Even then, I miss things. Witness my Bashere/Tenobia goof from the last book. Thank heaven for Maria and Alan.
