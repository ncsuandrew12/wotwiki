10% cut from the next chapter; last for the night. Need some sleep.

Angry email today from someone telling me to stop 'whining' about
*Towers of Midnight*
's length. Not whining, dude, just trying to push myself hard to edit.

The goal of this revision is to cut, not to add. I'll do either one to help the book, but I set goals for myself and try hard to meet them.

The final book will be the length it must be. But during this edit, my mindset HAS to be "Cut" or I'll get lazy and let bad language slide.
