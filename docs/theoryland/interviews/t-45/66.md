Okay, guys, I know this is tragic to hear...but your book needs a new scene. Out of rewriting mode. Into new writing mode. (Sigh.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21045859652)

New scene done. (Wasn't very long; added it to the end of another scene.) Onward with editing.

And...small drum roll...50%. Took me four days. At this rate, taking Sunday off, I will be done Tuesday instead of Monday. We shall see.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21050124566)

Ending tonight at 51%. Spent some of my time going back and looking over the new scene, giving it a few drafts. Night, all.
