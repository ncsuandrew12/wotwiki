Okay, 16% cut.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19606969835)

8% cut from Chapter 80. In other news, the chapters have numbers now. 94 chapters in the book plus a multi-scene epilogue.

Chapter 81 is a heart-wrenching one. Maybe the one in the book I'm most proud of, despite its contents. Anyway, 18.5% cut from it.

Chapter 82—13% cut. I do think that some of these chapters may be combined before the end. I doubt the final book will have 94 chapters.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19634795588)

12.2% cut from the next chapter.

#### Footnote

The 'heart-wrenching' scene was Aviendha's second trip through the crystal columns.
