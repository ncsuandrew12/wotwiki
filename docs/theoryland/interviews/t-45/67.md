Back to work on
*Towers of Midnight*
. Canceled Writing Group tonight to get more time. Goal for today is to get to 66%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21093539169)

Hm. This scene needs better description. Well, off to the Big White Book to do a little research on how the area should look...

For those following along, the scene that I cut from
*Towers of Midnight*
, then found a way to add back in, is now in chapter 30.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21106737225)

At 53% so far today. Man, I need to step it up, eh? Not sure what is causing me to go so slowly today. Only 2% so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21110838054)

Okay, at 55%. Much better progress through this hour.

#### [BOB GIBSON](http://twitter.com/HonorGod/status/21052616064)

How do you determine that a book needs another scene, especially so late in the process?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21111226764)

Just instincts. Something needed to be added to properly pace the narrative.

I don't suppose you'd be willing to give us a hint on what was so important that you needed to add a new scene this late?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21130014478)

It's less that it was super important, and more I felt a new scene would smooth things.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21136854497)

Oh, and at 62%. Not sure if I'll hit that 66% mark or not.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21142037926)

Okay, 64% will have to be the end for tonight. 5am. Seems like a good time for bed.
