Chapter 28 is the longest in the book, I think. I just cut 12.5% from it, and it's still 8k words long.

Off to bed. 12%, 18%, 12% cut from latest chapters. Book is under 350k words now. About 35% through the revision.

14.3%, 14.7%, 13.7%, 15.2% cut from the last four chapters Really getting into the groove of editing now.
