By the way, 9% cut from the last chapter. That was a tough one to revise.

Well, that was brutal. 71% cut from that chapter, the remaining bit spliced onto the end of the last chapter.

In revision, I'd decided to do what this chapter did in another chapter, and did it better there. So this one got gutted.

First airport chapter cut by 10%. One of my favorites in the book.

15% cut from the chapter I edited on the flight.
