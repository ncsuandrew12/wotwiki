Time for everyone's favorite draft, the one where I cut 10-15% of the book, line by line.
*Towers of Midnight*
is at 362k words. Can I get it under 310?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17818830894)

14.5% cut from the first scene of
*Towers of Midnight*
. In reply, I'm hoping to have this done in ten days. Faster, if possible.

8.9% cut from next scene. Trust me, as I warn every time I post about this process, you DON'T want these words. This makes the book better.
