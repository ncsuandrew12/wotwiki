9% on the next chapter, then 15.5% on the next. (Which is one of my favorites, but needed a mighty trim anyway.)

Last for the night: 8%, 10.5%, 12% cut from three chapters. We are about 15% of the way through the draft. Going slower than I wanted.

1/2 of 1 % cut from the next chapter. Stated that way, it doesn't seem like I've been doing anything for the last hour. (Had to add a lot.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18072062075)

9.8% off the next chapter. That's more like it.
