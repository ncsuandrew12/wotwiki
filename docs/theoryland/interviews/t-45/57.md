Chapter 84: 13.5% cut. On a roll today, though perhaps it's because the end of this stage is in sight.

8.3% cut off the next chapter. I think that means I did 8 chapters today, which is a record.

Another 8.3% on the next chapter.

All is coming together. Exchanged emails with Team Jordan. I suspect the final book will end up around 60 chapters, after combining scenes.

Also, 9.6% on the next chapter. 7+Epilogue remaining.

After what may be known as the Great Chapter Melding of 2010, I merged many shorter chapters together.
*Towers of Midnight*
is now 70 chapters long.

This feels like the right number to me. It may change by one or two from here, but I think we're close to final.

**Q:**
Has the chapter you mentioned earlier (the painful one that is one of your favorites) changed numbers now?
  
**A:**
Yes. It's #60 now.

Several of these last chapters are ones that need a lot of revision. So tonight is not going to go as quickly.
