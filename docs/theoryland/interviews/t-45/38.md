# [Interview #45: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#38)

Back at work. 14% or so cut from the next scene. These are various parts of the prologue, if you're curious.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17851153968)

12.6% cut from the next scene. Two more to do in the prologue.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17855092569)

3.5% and 8.2% from next two [scenes]. Many are asking if I can, someday, show what I cut. Maybe someday.

This book belongs to Harriet, so releasing anything—even lists of cut words—must be done carefully. Easier to show you with
*The Way of Kings*
.

Hello first paragraph of Chapter One. I guess I'm not cutting any words from you....

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17899484724)

Sigh. For those complaining that you don't want me to cut the book at all, the next chapter GREW by 1.7%. Added more than I cut.

14% cut from next one. Editing is not much fun. Maybe I need to buy more Magic cards to motivate me. Open one pack per five chapters? Hm...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17906620650)

760 words cut from the next chapter. It's a big one, though, so that's only 12%.

Ever thought of doing unabridged i.e. not cut spec-eds of your books? It worked for King and Feist.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17926151979)

Thing is, none of these edits are forced on me. These are edits I want to do. If I were ever forced to cut, Maybe.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17924018216)

For @ramhiser and others wondering, I run a spreadsheet to tell me how much I've cut. I find if I measure, it makes me more rigorous.
