# [Interview #45: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#34)

Ladies and Gentlemen, I have begun writing the final chapter for
*Towers of Midnight*
. Expect an "It's done" post later today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17285384553)

And...it is DONE! 359,000 words, 1800 pages in manuscript form. Nobody tell Tor. They asked me to try to keep it shorter. WHOOPS.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17285903896)

Note that I'm mostly joking about the length. Tor does prefer books shorter than 400k, but they've always let me write as long as needed.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17285952315)

And, just to warn you all, I WILL do my standard 10% cut on this book. So expect the final length to be around 320k or so. (
*The Gathering Storm*
was 300k.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17286096923)

Either way, the first draft of
*Towers of Midnight*
is done. We are now confirmed for an on-time release late October or early November 2010.
