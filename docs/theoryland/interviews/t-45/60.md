Document in the hands of beta readers. Time is counting down to our deadline. Hope they read quickly...

Okay, I stayed up way too late (about 6:00am) getting the
*Towers of Midnight*
document to beta readers. Feeling worn out today. Will read for writing group.

Many are asking about how to become beta readers. Well, it's different for my own books than it is for WoT...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19947963713)

For WoT, Harriet's in charge; the betas are people she trusts and knows. For myself, it varies by book. Usually people I know, though.
