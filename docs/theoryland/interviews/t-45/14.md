*Towers of Midnight*
was at 320k words. Dropped to 275k after merciless cutting of bad chapters. Now back up to 280k. Makes progress bar tough to estimate.

Getting ready to send a chunk of
*Towers of Midnight*
to Team Jordan. First, need to see if I spelled anyone's name wrong. I'm looking at you, Gallenne.

Grr. Why do I always spell '
*damane*
' as '
*demane*
' instead? I've only written it a hundred times or so.

It's off. 400 pages (about 80k words) sent for first reactions from Team Jordan. You can count this as the first step in turning in the book.
