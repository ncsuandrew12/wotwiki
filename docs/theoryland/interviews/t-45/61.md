Onward. Need to get a tweaked draft of
*Towers of Midnight*
to Harriet tomorrow. Two weeks left on our deadline to get the final, final draft to Tor.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20122532400)

Going through
*Towers of Midnight*
and adding chapter names/icons (both chosen by Harriet) and combining chapters at her direction.

#### [NICK CASSANOVA](http://twitter.com/BreakTheMirror/status/20123128834)

With the newly combined chapters, which is the sad chapter that you had said was number 60?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20123503945)

Don't know yet. I have to check with Harriet on a few more combinations before I will have a final chapter total.

Today's task: Going through
*Towers of Midnight*
and giving italics/cap letters to in world terms. (And taking away caps from others that I got wrong.)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/20192883324)

Ditto. (Re-tweet)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20175540656)

Working on epigraphs for
*Towers of Midnight*
right now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185296529)

**Q:**
Now that the chapters have been changed around, what is the new number of chapter 81? (The one you said was one of your favorite?)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185312166)

**A:**
That is now chapter 50. It should remain there.

Good question: @graphicbin\_sean asks "Who chooses the scenes for the cover art for WoT? How about
*Towers of Midnight*
?"

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185706428)

**A:**
Harriet usually picks. I picked the scenes for
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
, though, as we had to get them painted before Harriet read the books.

#### [SHIVAM BHATT](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/20179299505)

Who writes the [glossary] entries at the back of every WoT book?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20188353292)

Maria does those.
