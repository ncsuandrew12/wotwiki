# [Interview #45: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#1)

This is a collection of WoT-related tweets only. For a complete catalog of Brandon's tweets, visit the
[Twitter Portal](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/)
at Brandon's website. The catalog of tom:wip tweets (that is,
*Towers of Midnight*
: Work In Progress) is a little more sparse than the amol:wip catalog, where I pay more attention to the conversation with the fans.

Today's work: Write the wind's scene in
*Towers of Midnight*
. (As I've noted, I'm not going through the books in order, but by viewpoint.)
