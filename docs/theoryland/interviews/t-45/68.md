# [Interview #45, Entry #68]: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#68)

What am I doing? I'm most certainly NOT adding two more quick scenes to
*Towers of Midnight*
. Why do you ask? (Hides under his bed, keeps typing.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21191546597)

Okay, completely rewrote a section of a climactic scene that I wasn't satisfied with, and two new scenes added to enhance it. Much better.

Hope Team Jordan doesn't kill me for adding this so late. Note, none of these were added 'just because.' I really felt the book needed them.

Ha! Just looked at the new Beta reader file, and it includes a suggestion for a new scene...doing exactly what I just added on my own today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21208190041)

Okay, new scenes are looking good.

So what do the beta readers do? Are they pretty much editors like Harriet and look to see how book flows or what?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21303033985)

Betas are like a test audience. Like the kind you'd pre-screen a movie for before releasing it.
