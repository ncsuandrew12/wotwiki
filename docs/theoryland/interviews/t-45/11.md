Just cut about four pages off of a chapter of
*Towers of Midnight*
. Sorry. It's for your own good.

To respond to questions:
*Towers of Midnight*
is still on schedule, though it will be very tight. I need to turn it in early August at the latest.

Whew. That chapter was very full of fat. Trimmed a lot.

About two hundred pages of
*Towers of Midnight*
revised; two hundred more in this part before I can write new material. Right now, one hour off for dinner.

Hope to get five more chapters revised tonight. That will place me in a position to do a new chapter tomorrow.
