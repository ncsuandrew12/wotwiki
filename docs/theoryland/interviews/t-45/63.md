# [Interview #45: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process, Entry #63](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#63)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (17 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20773785888)

Today's 10% done; will keep going. (Note, these percentages aren't cuts, like last time. This is how far through the book I am.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20778010276)

Okay, 12% done today. Will go to bed now. Trying to sleep a little earlier/rise a little earlier this week.

*Towers of Midnight*
update: 15% of the final revision done, despite Limeboy climbing in my lap and insisting that I show him Spongebob on the computer.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20832875928)

17% of the revision done so far. (5% so far today.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20843901805)

19% done so far. (7% today) Had a bit of a slow down with a scene I needed to add, but am through that and moving onward.

**Question from Peter on Facebook:**
Is this final revision final? If you're adding scenes, won't there be more touch-up?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20851784997)

**A:**
After this is turned in, the book goes to copyedit & proofreads. Small things can be fixed/changed then. You could call those 'drafts.'

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20851829971)

I don't see them that way, as this is my last full read-through the book. Maria will do the copyedit approvals. I may still tweak, though.
