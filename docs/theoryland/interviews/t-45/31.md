That chapter of
*Towers of Midnight*
I just wrote ends with a cliffhanger. Sorry about that. I pick it up soon, though, so you won't have to wait long.

I promise this cliffhanger chapter isn't the last one in the book. In fact, it's closer to the front.

This wasn't the final chapter of the book, which he wrote a while ago. This was the last chapter he had left to write, and it happens somewhere before the end of the book.

Are we to assume that the end of
*Towers of Midnight*
will NOT be a cliffhanger? You seemed eager to reassure us. Or RAFO?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18071290908)

RAFO. It was just that chapter I was talking about.
