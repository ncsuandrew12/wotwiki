Do you try to write straight through a book from start to finish or do you write random bits and then put them together?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17397303066)

I usually write straight through, sometimes by plot line. But some books—like
*Towers of Midnight*
—don't let me do that.
