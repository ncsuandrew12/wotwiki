#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (12 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18377560747)

9.2% off of the next (very long) chapter. This revision is looking good so far.

4.6% off the next chapter. With some additions. In answer to a question: I am editing in order, not by character thread.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18388999857)

12.8% and 9.2% cut from the next two chapters. All goes well so far. Still a lot of work to do. (This is the 1/4 mark in the revision.)
