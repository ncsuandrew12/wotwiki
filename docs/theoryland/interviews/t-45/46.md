18%, 11%, 13% cut on next three. Whew. This is getting grueling. I'm gonna need to buy more Magic cards. (What? The logic works in my head.)

17% cut from the next chapter.

15% and 17% cut from the next two chapters, which means one more and I can open one of those packs of magic cards. Onward!

Whew. 9.5% cut from that chapter. I WOULD have to end up doing one of the longest ones in the book this time. Now, Magic cards!
