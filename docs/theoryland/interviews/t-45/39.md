# [Interview #45: Twitter: TOM Writing and Editing Process, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=45#39)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (7 July 2010)](http://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson#%21/BrandonSandrson?v=wall&story_fbid=131255600248472&ref=mf)

12% and 15% on the next two chapters. The one coming up is one of the ones that needs the most work. Joy.

Lots of repeated description, passive language, and unneeded dialogue tags. Also, some distracting character ponderings.

Okay, major overhaul to that chapter is done. 8.5% cut, though that's only a weak indication of the gutting—then rebuilding—it was given.

2% added to the next chapter. (Sigh.) 12% cut from the one after that. 5500 words total cut so far.

Back to editing. People are asking what chapter I'm on, but the chapters don't have numbers yet. Order isn't 100% nailed down yet either.
