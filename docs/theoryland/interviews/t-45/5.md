**Q:**
Why has the
*Towers of Midnight*
progress bar been stuck at the same number for so long?

**A:**
Been doing revisions. Plan to do a
[blog post](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/870/Some-Long-Awaited-Updates)
soon.

Problem: I want the book to work on its own, and not feel like "All of the stuff that didn't go in
*The Gathering Storm*
thrown together."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/7694546315)

This book needs to be at least as good as
*The Gathering Storm*
, if not better. Either way, it's probably going to be longer—consider yourself warned.
