# [Interview #126, Entry #5]: WH Signing Report - Brian](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=126#5)

#### Robert Jordan

—Talked about some of his medals and how he got them.

—Again talked about people writing in his world and this time made another reference to "breaking something".

—Talked about some of his reference material he has made such as a listing of all of the Aes Sedai. Said that alone takes up an entire floppy disk.

—And the funniest thing of the night was when a friend of mine asked him about the \*sniffs\* RJ said that "a women can put more in a single sniff than a guy can in a 'Yo Mutha!'"

That was funny. RJ actually said 'Yo Mutha!'

RJ cool
