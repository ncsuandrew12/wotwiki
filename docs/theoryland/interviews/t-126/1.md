# [Interview #126: WH Signing Report - Brian, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=126#1)

#### Brian

Tonight's book signing was more fun.

It's exam time so I am taking breaks any way I can folks.

There wasn't as many people here in Charlotte which surprised me. I ended up buying another copy of
*Winter's Heart*
since he will only sign those bought at the store he is at, at the time. (selling my other copy at half.com)

I met up with a few people after we had our books signed and as we were talking we noticed that most of the people had already left. One of the guys still in the store came outside to tell us that he would now personalize the books since we had already waited before I guess.

I don't even know what he wrote in the book yet but I was surprised that he did as I heard that he hardly ever personalizes the books. Guess it takes too long.
