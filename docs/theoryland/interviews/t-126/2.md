# [Interview #126: WH Signing Report - Brian, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=126#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Tonight was fun because his family was there as well as his wife. I am guessing he has a lot of family here because I heard RJ say a few times that "he's my cousin/she's my cousin". One guy, about 20 or so came in and somebody asked "Is that Mat?" and the guy standing and talking to RJ's wife turned to us and said, "Well, yeah probably." The guy was the kid's father and probably RJ's nephew.

The guy did seem to be a likeness to Mat but had the whole N'Sync earring thing going.
