#### Brian

Some more random RJ stuff for those that are actually reading these posts...

#### Robert Jordan

—Pulled up in a black stretch limo with police escort (one car).

—Opened up with the same exact intro as Raleigh.

—As I had him sign the 'Faces of Fantasy' book he was talking about the picture. He said that the photographer came in and saw his chair and that he was actually on his way to a "black tie affair and she had to have me in my tux". Then he said "ya know, I wasn't trying to be all suave you know."
