## [Entry #1](./t-772/1)

#### Jennifer Liang

I asked Brandon about Sulin this evening.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that he had originally placed Sulin [with Rand] very intentionally, intending to do "something" with her. However, after a conversation with Maria, he became convinced that his original plans regarding this character were not workable, so Sulin will be edited out of future editions of
*The Gathering Storm*
.
