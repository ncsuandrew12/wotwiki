#### Shawn Speakman

Earlier you mentioned that you have to get back home to get back to the Wheel of Time. How long have you been working on it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, you know, I started working in 2007 on finishing the series. The last one I started working on January 1st. It's due in November. On my website we have a little... I have a little counter saying how much I've got done. I'm at one quarter right now. That's a little bit deceptive, because I've been jumping around and outlining and building sections later on; and so when I hit them, they'll go really fast. So it's probably more like half done—maybe a smidge more. But it doesn't look like that on the website. You know, I have to turn it in November, so I’m plugging along.

#### Shawn Speakman

How do you feel about it so far?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I feel good. I feel really good. You know, Robert Jordan wrote the ending himself before he passed away. I just have to get there without screwing it up. And so, that's what I'm doing.

#### Shawn Speakman

Awesome. Great. I know people have loved the first two volumes that you've had to work on. And so...that's fantastic.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

The fan response has been fantastic. I felt really anxious; I feel really anxious every time. And so I guess it won't stop with this last one, but at least with the fan response being so good, it takes a bit of the anxiety off.

#### Shawn Speakman

Right.
