#### Shawn Speakman

Those side projects that you mentioned... Obviously
*The Way of Kings*
came out last year, was a phenomenal success...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's not a side project.

#### Shawn Speakman

Yeah, that's not a side project.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did this knowing that I would still try to keep my main...you know, I would still try to keep
*Mistborn*
and
*Way of Kings*
—Stormlight Archive—with support. You know, I have to work a lot of sixteen hour days to make sure it does, but I didn't want my readers to get short-changed for the Wheel of Time readers, even though Wheel of Time is my main focus right now. And so I've made sure I'm still doing that; I just can't do the other wacky things I've done. My kids' books—I couldn't finish that series until the Wheel of Time is done. You know, the contract ran out, but I still want to do another one, but I could not sign another contract, couldn't write that book because—

#### Shawn Speakman

You're under contract already.

#### Brandon Sanderson

—I'm under contract. I have to do the Wheel of Time, I have to make sure it's got all of my attention and that it comes out and is really good. So those side projects just had to fall by the wayside.
