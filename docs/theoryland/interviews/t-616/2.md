#### Shawn Speakman

My name is Shawn Speakman, I'm with Suvudu, and I'm standing here with Brandon Sanderson. Brandon, how ya doing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm doing well. How are you?

#### Shawn Speakman

Great. Pretty good. Busy con already for you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Shawn Speakman

You're actually leaving a little early. How was your day today?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My day was good. Packed. I've been traveling so much lately, I need to get home and back to work, so I'm only doing one day of the con. Hopefully in the future I can do more, but this time I head home and get back to work on the Wheel of Time.

#### Shawn Speakman

Great. Awesome. The panel you were on today was an awesome confluence of fantasy geekdom. Why don't you talk a little bit about the panelists and what you thought about the panel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Boy. It was...it was awesome. On a panel like that, I really am not sure I... I get torn, because I really don't want to say anything. Because I just want to hear what George Martin and Pat Rothfuss have to say. Because George is fascinating and Pat is hilarious, and between the two of them, they can carry like a five hour panel on their own.

#### Shawn Speakman

Right.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You throw in Kevin Anderson and Christopher Paolini, both throwing in the odd wise crack, and I just want to grab the popcorn and sit back. But I think it was a really great panel. The questions were good, the answers were... You know, sometimes on panels you get the same answer over and over again from every panelist, and this time there was some discussion, some distinctiveness about each comment, and so I think it was really informative.

#### Shawn Speakman

Great.
