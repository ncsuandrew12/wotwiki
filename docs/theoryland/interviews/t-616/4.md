#### Shawn Speakman

With Robert Jordan basically having turned in that ending, how do you as a fan, how do you feel about how everything wraps up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was really satisfied with it. It was the first thing I read out of all his notes; when I got to Harriet's house for the first time, I read that ending, and I was very satisfied. I really... I think it ties up well.

#### Shawn Speakman

Great.
