#### Shawn Speakman

Your next
*Mistborn*
book comes out in November.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In November, yes.

#### Shawn Speakman

Excellent. Why don't you tell us a little about it, and how you came to create it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I pitched the
*Mistborn*
series to Tor, I pitched it as a continuum, as a group of different smaller series set in a fantasy world that I... I had never seen it done before. That doesn't mean it hasn’t been done. Lots of things have been done. But I had never seen a series do a big epic fantasy trilogy, and then jump forward hundreds of years and have the technology have grown and changed. It seems like when we jump around in fantasy worlds, we're always kind of in the same tech level, and I wanted to do something different; I wanted to write this... The
*Mistborn*
trilogy is done and tied up, and it is an epic fantasy trilogy—I love how it turned out. Now I'm jumping forward hundreds of years and doing stories in the same world, with the magic still being around during the age of industry. And so this is a... This is guns and skyscrapers and cars and allomancers. Right about...equivalency of early 1900s. And so it's the dawn of electric power, and the dawn of motor cars and things like this. Kind of a clash between magic and the technology, and a guy who's kind of caught between the two.

#### Shawn Speakman

This sounds standalone-ish. Like a new person to
*Mistborn*
could actually jump into it and...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it's definitely a new jumping in point. It does not have major spoilers for the previous series. So it's one you can just read, and the first chapters are on Tor.com. We're pushing the... We're publishing the first five on the website, so people can just go read them there.

#### Shawn Speakman

Will you be touring?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will be. I'll be doing a tour in the US and in the UK.

#### Shawn Speakman

Because the Wheel of Time book will be turned in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. The Wheel of Time book is turned in, and then I go on tour.

#### Shawn Speakman

Excellent.
