# [Interview #261, Entry #4]: Robert Jordan's Blog: A TOUCH OF THIS AND THAT BEFORE THE MAYO](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=261#4)

#### Robert Jordan

Various folks have asked about making donations, and I see that Jason at Dragonmount has already put up the information about donating to the Mayo Clinic Amyloidosis Program. Thanks, Jason. I think its best to keep the giving centered at one place. That way there is more chance of it having an effect. Maybe for me and maybe not, but remember what I said. Amyloids pop up in all sorts of places, and it is entirely possible that amyloid research will eventually lead to a cure, or at least an effective treatment, for Alzheimer's. Your donation may just help with that, and that would be something to feel special about.
