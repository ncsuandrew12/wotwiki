# [Interview #261: Robert Jordan's Blog: A TOUCH OF THIS AND THAT BEFORE THE MAYO, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=261#9)

#### Robert Jordan

For Pat, who asked subtly, yes, I am, but like my father and grandfather before me, I don't advertise. We like to believe that no man in this country should feel in danger because of his beliefs, but times change. History tells us that, even here. Political practices we see as unthinkable were carried out as a matter of course by Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. Who can say what tomorrow will bring, or next year, or next decade? So should you ask me again, I have no idea what you are talking about unless you are inside the walls of a Lodge.

#### Footnote

In case it's not clear, RJ is saying that he is a Mason.
