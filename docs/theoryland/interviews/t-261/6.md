# [Interview #261: Robert Jordan's Blog: A TOUCH OF THIS AND THAT BEFORE THE MAYO, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=261#6)

#### Robert Jordan

Perrab asks whether it was the pipesmoking. No, not at all. At one point recently, when they were trying to find out why I had a cough, I not only got two chest X-rays in one week but also a CAT scan of my chest. It turns out that despite all of my years smoking pipes and cigars I could be a poster boy for clean lungs. They are absolutely sterling! I'm thinking of licensing the film to Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland, various Rocky Mountain resorts and other places that supposedly have clean air. I am talking pristine!

that when he quit smoking cigarettes and started smoking pipes in his youth, that he taught himself not to inhale.
