# [Interview #261, Entry #11]: Robert Jordan's Blog: A TOUCH OF THIS AND THAT BEFORE THE MAYO](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=261#11)

#### Robert Jordan

For A'rrien, my prayers go out to you and your wife. I hope that she is getting better and recovering swiftly. I find it remarkable under the circumstances that you were willing to put even five minutes into posting to my blog.

For Jen, whose mother had a bad reaction to Reglan after an ASCT, thank you very much for the information, both from your comment on the blog and from the e-mail forwarded to me by a mutual friend. I have printed out the information you sent, and it will go with me to the Mayo among my papers. Again, thank you very much.
