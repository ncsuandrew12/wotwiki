# [Interview #261: Robert Jordan's Blog: A TOUCH OF THIS AND THAT BEFORE THE MAYO, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=261#7)

#### Robert Jordan

A few people seem confused over what I mean by saying that I need thirty years to complete the books in my head. That entails a lot more than The Wheel of Time. There is
*A Memory of Light*
, of course, the last main sequence novel of WoT, plus two more short prequel novels. Then there are, possibly, three "outrigger" novels set in the WoT universe. There are the two trilogies of Infinity of Heaven, set in quite another universe. Plus there are several other novels and a handful of novellas that are set in neither universe. A few of them are actually set in our own universe, though not always without a twist. So there are a fair number, even to spread out over 30 years.
