## [Entry #1](./t-1117/1)

#### Team Jordan

Over the next month or two we plan on posting a few files from Robert Jordan's notes that, for one reason or another, will not be represented directly in the forthcoming
*The Wheel of Time Companion*
.

While some of these files won't be exciting to a lot of people [YMMV depending on personal interests], they offer good examples of the types of material RJ felt it was important to document. They have been edited in minor ways for consistency and ease of reading—for example, most of the entries in this post had codes designating where each expression appeared in the books, a carry over from the days pre-digitalization.
