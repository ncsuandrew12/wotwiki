# [Interview #902: The Heir to Tolkien and Jordan: An Interview with Brandon Winn Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=902#5)

#### Daily Dragon

How did you find the time and energy to work on
*The Way of Kings*
while you were immersed in Jordan's Wheel of Time? Are you a hidden Allomancer, a slider like Wayne in
*The Alloy of Law*
, with the ability to set up a mind-boggling speed bubble?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wish I could magically create bubbles of time to give myself more space to do these things. After working on
*The Gathering Storm*
, I felt more and more that I needed to do
*The Way of Kings*
—I had done it and failed once, and I began to see all of the places where it went wrong and how I could fix it. When you get excited about a book that way, you kind of have to write it—strike while the iron is hot. It's something I never want to do again—working on that and
*Towers of Midnight*
at the same time just about killed my entire family. The hours were very long, and I'm still kind of recovering from that. How did I find the time? I didn't do much else during that year when I was getting those both ready. I think it was really good for me to do, and I don't think I'll ever do something like that again.
