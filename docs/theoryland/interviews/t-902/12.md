# [Interview #902: The Heir to Tolkien and Jordan: An Interview with Brandon Winn Sanderson, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=902#12)

#### Daily Dragon

According to your blog, an RPG video game called
*Mistborn: Birthright*
, based on your Mistborn series, will be coming out in 2013. Can you give us a teaser?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's set hundreds of years before the first trilogy. I'm writing the story, and it's about a young nobleman who gets entangled in events he did not expect at all. It should be a whole bunch of fun, and I'm trying to work into it things like the origins of the mistcloak and fun stuff like that, [so] we can dig into the past of the world and see the origins of a lot of things that we see later on in the series.
