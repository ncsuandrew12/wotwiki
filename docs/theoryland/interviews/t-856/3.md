ITEM #2: RELEASE EVENTS

I will be doing two special signings in conjunction with the book's release on January 8th. Like with my previous books, I will be numbering copies in conjunction with these release events. The two events are: the
[BYU Bookstore midnight release](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=856#4)
and the
[Weller Book Works mail order event](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=856#5)
(SOLD OUT).

What does it mean to get a numbered copy? Well, just what it sounds like. If you get a book from one of the two release events, I'll number your copy. I intend to give out as many numbers as there are people who participate in those events (unless we run out of books). In a way, these numbers are less about being limited editions and more about getting a special add-on, an indication that you made it to one of the initial events. This is something I started doing for fun with my first book, and I had originally intended to limit the numbers to the first fifty people who got to me. However, I found that I felt bad stopping numbering if someone went to all the trouble to come to the release party, so I shifted to doing it this way.

I generally stagger my numbering so that lower numbers can be picked up from each signing. Each number is unique. I will rotate by 100s. (So, 1–100 are at BYU, 101–200 are at Weller Book Works, 201–300 are at BYU, etc.)

Each event will have its own rules regarding how you get your number and which number you get. Read on for info.
