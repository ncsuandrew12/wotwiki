## [Entry #1](./t-898/1)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

This past weekend I was at the
[World Fantasy Convention](http://www.fact.org/wfc2006/)
in Toronto, and
[Brandon Sanderson](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/)
, author of the Mistborn series,
*The Way of Kings*
, and co-authored the last books in the
[Wheel of Time series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time)
was kind enough to let interview him earlier today.

**Slight spoiler warning for
*Towers of Midnight***

## [Entry #2](./t-898/2)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

So... Hoid. We see him in almost all of your books, though I don’t think I saw him in
*The Emperor's Soul*
...

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's referenced in
*The Emperor’s Soul*
, but he got cut from the book. I actually wrote the scene with him in it, but it didn't fit so we had to cut it.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Are we ever going to get his origin story, or learn more about him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, we definitely will learn more about him. A book that has more of him is
*Dragonsteel*
, which I wrote when I was undergraduate as my honors thesis. It's not his origin story, but it's one he's mostly part of. We will find out everything, and get the complete story for him. It will happen eventually.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Well, I look forward to reading more about him... He's an interesting character.

## [Entry #3](./t-898/3)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Mat Cauthon's foxhead medallion is described as having only one eye, and that's in the shape of the ancient symbol for Aes Sedai. Was this foreshadowing the events that happened the Mat in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe it was probably foreshadowing. Jim knew since book one what was going to happen, so I would say yes. My instincts say yes, but there's nothing in his notes which said so one way or another. I've always felt that it was.

## [Entry #4](./t-898/4)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

In
*Lord of Chaos*
, there’s a point when Rand is in Shadar Logoth, and Lews Therin whispers to him "I must kill Demandred." Is there some sort of connection between Demandred and Shadar Logoth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There may well be... I'm not sure if I can answer that question, so... RAFO.

## [Entry #5](./t-898/5)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Okay, so can Darkfriends or maybe even Forsaken be bound to the Horn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Let's see if I can answer this one... They're not going to be, I don't think there's a law against... But only the greatest heroes are bound to the Horn. They are not the greatest heroes. So, why are you asking this?

#### Rebecca Lovatt

I’m pretty much asking about Verin, and the likelihood of her being bound.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, I don't know that there would be anything forbidding Verin from being bound to the Horn.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Is there any mention of that in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Alright, thank you though...

## [Entry #6](./t-898/6)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Also, not so much about your stories in particular...but you've written a lot of different types of books, the huge epic fantasies, short stories...different types of fantasy, and the odd ones like
*Legion*
. Which do you enjoy writing the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Answering questions like this one is difficult; it's like "Pick your favorite food". If you eat that food every day you're going to eventually hate it...or slowly find the food less and less enjoyable. For me, that's how it is with writing.

Epic Fantasy is my favorite form, but if I'm only ever doing Epic Fantasy, I feel like I will get burned out on it, and I'll stop enjoying it as much and so I don't want to see that happen. So when I start to feel like it, I let myself, within certain bounds, write whatever I want to write so that when I get back to Epic Fantasy I'm feeling fresh. It's not a matter of what I like to write the most, it's a matter of what I'm feeling like at the time. Sometimes you may not want to eat your favorite food.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And when you're switching between these different types of stories, are there any major difficulties that you face?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I do, then it means something's going wrong and I kind of need to look at why I'm trying to write it... Switching is not hard, usually. You get to know your writing style, you get comfortable with how you approach things.

## [Entry #7](./t-898/7)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Okay, and, next year, we're getting Stormlight Archive book 2? Or will that be early 2014?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It should be Christmas 2013; that's what we're aiming for. In fact, I have to name it this weekend so TOR can start the publicity for it.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And then we're also getting
*A Memory of Light*
, obviously, and
*The Rithmatist*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that's the book I wrote just before Wheel of Time in 2007, back before I was offered a Wheel of Time offer...and it languished for years because I was so busy with Wheel of Time—and when I had any free time,
*The Way of Kings*
—I wasn't even able to do revisions. The three or four months it would have taken would have slowed down one of those two books, so I was able to take those months after
*A Memory of Light*
was done.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And is there anything next year?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know when
*Steelheart*
will be out, but probably 2014...but it is on people's radars. This is another one before I took up before Wheel of Time, but I wrote it in gaps between books, so people know about it. I've been trying to shop it Hollywood for years, but I was finally able to polish it off and sell it. Once Wheel a Time was done I was finally able to spend time on these things which have been put aside for years. Things like this are good, but to give them the time to make them great while I was working on them would have taken time away from
*A Memory of Light*
, and it wouldn't have been right to let them demand that time, so it wasn't until recently that I've been able to give them that time. So, I think that'll be 2014, but we do get three books next year most likely.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Yep, and that's great... I'm looking forward to reading them all.

## [Entry #8](./t-898/8)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And with
*A Memory of Light*
being finished, is it odd not having it to work on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is... It's very strange experience since it's been such a part of my life for so long, to not have it to work on... But I do intend to be a part of the fandom for the rest of my life. So, there is that.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

I know a lot of people are looking for it, and there will always be more theories. I do remember last year when I spoke with you, you did say there will be loose ends, so people will be theorizing on those for a while.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, there will be loose ends, and I can talk to that when the book comes out.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Alrighty then! You'll just have to come back to Toronto then.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, well that's a deal then.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Alright, I think that’s it... Thank you!

## [Entry #9](./t-898/9)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Brandon also read a passage from
*A Memory of Light*
while he was here in Toronto (the beginning of the first chapter/the wind scene), as well as a bit from the Stormlight Archive Book 2.
