## [Entry #1](./t-137/1)

#### Gonzo the Great

Not all the questions were asked, but I have repeated all of them, with (wherever applicable) the answers we received. Some of these things refer to
*Winter's Heart*
, so there are some spoilers in here. I do not think they are too bad, and I am sure most of this is interesting to everyone, so I will post it here and let you decide to stop reading if you do not want to get any information before you have finished that book.

## [Entry #2](./t-137/2)

#### Gonzo the Great

Why do Aviendha, Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve keep quiet about Mazrim Taim having been turned to the Shadow?

## [Entry #3](./t-137/3)

#### Gonzo the Great

Why did Elayne and Nynaeve assume that the male
*a'dam*
had been taken care of?

## [Entry #4](./t-137/4)

#### Gonzo the Great

How did Bashere approach Rand without being announced the first time?

#### Robert Jordan

Matters were a bit confused at the time. It was just coincidence.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

One down.

## [Entry #5](./t-137/5)

#### Gonzo the Great

Are the main characters ever going to quarrel over keeping secrets?

## [Entry #6](./t-137/6)

#### Gonzo the Great

Is Mat really as strongly
*ta'veren*
as Hawkwing was?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Two down.

## [Entry #7](./t-137/7)

#### Gonzo the Great

I noticed that only men use the phrase 'so-called', while only women use 'who called themselves'. Is that a coincidence, or is it intentional?

#### Robert Jordan

Coincidence.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Three down. This is not going well.

#### Footnote

Gonzo is confused since women use the phrase 'so-called' quite a bit.

## [Entry #8](./t-137/8)

#### Dragon Theif [sic]

Is it possible for two souls to inhabit one body at the same time without the aid of the Dark One's powers?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Obvious :D .

#### Footnote

This question was asked because
[some people](http://www.theoryland.com/factions.php?func=4&rec=31)
at Theoryland believed that Rand and Lews Therin were separate souls.

## [Entry #9](./t-137/9)

#### TerceI

How did Aginor die in book one?

## [Entry #10](./t-137/10)

#### Gonzo the Great

Did Demandred recognise Flinn in the last chapter of
*Winter's Heart*
?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Naturally :( .

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Would Taim have recognised Flinn, in that position?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Yes.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Not expected, but not helpful either because of [the previous answer].

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Did you intend in
*Winter's Heart*
to make it clear that Demandred is not Taim?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

RAFO.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Obvious :D .

## [Entry #11](./t-137/11)

#### Question

Did you post that "Answer" post at Theoryland? Or have you ever posted a message at a messageboard?

#### Robert Jordan

Not quite answer (to another question): "I hardly ever look at the sites about WOT. If I sit behind my computer, I do what I like most there: I write."

## [Entry #12](./t-137/12)

#### Gonzo the Great

Is Ilyena reborn and if so, who?

## [Entry #13](./t-137/13)

#### Isabel

Can you tell me something more about how the taint was cleansed?

#### Robert Jordan

Shadar Logoth and the taint destroyed each other. -> Taint is destroyed.

## [Entry #14](./t-137/14)

#### TerceI

Can you explain Nicola's foretelling?

## [Entry #15](./t-137/15)

#### Frenzy

Can a Warder bond be passed to a non-channeler?

#### Robert Jordan

"No." He also said that a non-channeler could be included; I think he was referring to Min.

## [Entry #16](./t-137/16)

#### Gonzo the Great

A few more, possibly interesting, remarks and answers we got:

#### Robert Jordan

Being burned out is different from being stilled. The latter is not as severe as the former.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

This is just as I expected, or at least in no way in contrast with it. :)

## [Entry #17](./t-137/17)

#### Robert Jordan

Sammael is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He may be reborn again, but then he will not remember he was Sammael. He cannot be reincarnated. He is dead.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

To me, this suggests that we will not see Sammael again.

## [Entry #18](./t-137/18)

#### Robert Jordan

Not too many more books ... I hope. At least three.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

I got the distinct impression that he wants to finish it eventually.

## [Entry #19](./t-137/19)

#### Gonzo the Great

I asked a question about using gateways as cannons, but I am not certain I made clear what I had in mind, so this is not completely shot down yet.

#### Robert Jordan

You couldn't do it that way. Not the way you describe it, I think.

## [Entry #20](./t-137/20)

#### Robert Jordan

*New Spring*
is shorter than the notes on which it was based.

## [Entry #21](./t-137/21)

#### Question

When will we see Loial again?

#### Robert Jordan

(quite happily): RAFO :D !

## [Entry #22](./t-137/22)

#### Isabel

Can you eliminate anyone from the list of suspects in Asmodean's murder?

#### Robert Jordan

No. I like to see you wondering. It should be obvious to anyone.

#### Isabel

Not even a single one?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

(After some thinking): Rand. Apart from him, I will not clear any other suspects. Not even Bela.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

After this, it deteriorated into a discussion of Bela as the Creator/Moridin. Isabel defended my view that Moridin is Jeade'en, Rand's horse. For some reason, she failed to convince RJ; probably her fault, as my theory was very good. It was just my humility that made me stay in the background, of course. Certainly not the fact that I was not quite sure I could have defended it better.

#### Footnote

Gonzo's 'theory' derived from the prophecy which states that Rand will ride a horse named Death.

## [Entry #23](./t-137/23)

#### Gonzo the Great

Final result:
  
Three down, two RAFOs I expected, one idea badly damaged, and two as I told everyone was the case. All in all, I got a bit over 50 percent, and that is not as bad as I feared after the first few. ;)

PSâ€”Isabela, did you get anything more? I think you asked even more questions than I did, so you should have some more answers. I must admit, before you start mentioning irrelevant details, that I stole some of your answers for this post. But I had given fair warning, so that doesn't count. :)

#### Footnote

Isabel added her notes
