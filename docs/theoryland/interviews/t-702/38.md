#### Question

In the prologue in the Alloy of Law, it talks about how the guy actually spikes people to the wall. Is there going to be Hemalurgy involved?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a RAFO. Hey, RAFOs! I will say, in Alloy of Law time, Hemalurgy is not well-known and that’s not been spread around, and Feruchemy as an art moved like Allomancy did in that you can have just one of the powers. And we decided... Chemings? What did we decide, Peter? Oh, Ferings. We decided Ferings. We couldn’t decide bewteen the two of those. It’s in the book somewhere. [Editor’s note: Um, I don’t think so.] But anyway, you can have one Allomantic and one Feruchemical. But not a lot of Mistborn and not a lot of full Feruchemists anymore.
