#### Question

How epic is the Last Battle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I guess it depends on your definition of ‘epic’. I mean, it feels pretty epic to me. There’s a lot of stuff going on in this book. I hope people don’t get lost, is what I’m worried about. I mean, everything is kind of coming to a head. I can’t say much, but it’s pretty epic.
