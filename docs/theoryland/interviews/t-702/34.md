#### Question

This might seem kind of silly, but is there ever going to be a pronunciation guide for your work, perhaps? I argue with my brother on how the cities of Mistborn novels are pronounced.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah... maybe. I’m not so strict on pronunciation as some other authors are, because when I read books, I just pronounce things however I want in my head, and then I ignore what they said, how they should be pronounced. I can’t do that anymore with Wheel of Time. Fans are like, wait a minute, Robert Jordan said it, and I say, “oh, I mean...”. Though I once got Harriet and Maria--who is Robert Jordan’s assistant--into an argument about how Robert Jordan said one of the names. So even they can’t get them all right. Maybe eventually... there is one for Elantris, I believe. Or at least, there’s a linguistics guide. Elantris names are easy, though. That’s mostly predictable. Yeah, the Aons.
