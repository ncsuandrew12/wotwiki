#### Question

I’m not up-to-date as much as everyone else, but with Elantris, is there something happening to that with a second book or...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had the second book planned for 2015, at the ten year anniversary. We’ll see if I still manage to make that or not. If it’s going to do that, I’m going to have to write it in the next couple of years here. But my goal is to release a nice trade paperback edition of Elantris and a sequel at the same time. With maybe a redo of the map done by Isaac or something like that.
