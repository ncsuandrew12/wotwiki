#### Question

Your class that you teach at BYU, can you tell us more about it, like writing, when do you teach it...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I teach it Thursday nights, one night a week, for three hours. It is half-lecture, half-workshop, so, an hour and a half (supposedly) of lecture (it goes long sometimes) and an hour and a half of workshopping. It... you can get most everything I lecture by listening to Writing Excuses, which if you haven’t listened to, is my podcast. I cover a lot of it on there, but it’s just, you know. I do a lecture on magic systems. I do a lecture on sympathetic characters. I do a lecture on plotting and my goal is just to give you a bunch of tools that a bunch of different writers use, and to just say, “here is how they do it, you can try these different tools and see what works for you” because not every tool is going to work for every writer. In fact, a lot of writers have opposite processes from one another for accomplishing the same goals.
