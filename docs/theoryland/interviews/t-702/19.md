#### Question

In (?) someone told me about the switching over from Scholastic to Tor. I know you’ve mentioned before with Alcatraz you were unhappy how Scholastic portrayed the covers. So is changing the covers what you wanted it to be, or just to differ the Tor versions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We’re going to try and get them to something more like I envisioned originally. I originally wrote the Alcatraz books with Alcatraz at fifteen, and Scholastic pushed for him to be thirteen, and I’m not completely convinced that that was the right thing for his personality. So I may actually move him up a little bit in age. It would probably be Peter doing it: go find all references to ‘thirteen’!

#### QUESTION

Go Peter!

#### Mi'chelle

Would Bastille's age go up too?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah. They were both fifteen in the original draft. In the book they bought, they pushed it down to thirteen.

#### QUESTION

With changing the covers, will Alcatraz have different comments on the cover of book two?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Boy, I don’t know. I’ll have to watch that one. Maybe we’ll have to put the original one in there, the original cover of book two. Oh boy, that cover... it was like: this in space! This is a fantasy book. Why are they in space? O...kay.
