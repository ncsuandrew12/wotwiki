# [Interview #702, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=702#36)

#### Question

Speaking of videogames, I don’t know if you or anyone else here have noticed the similarities in the storyline of Fable III and Mistborn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, people have said that to me and I haven’t played Fable III.

#### QUESTION

It’s really uncanny. Yours was written first, obviously, but going through it I was just like “I wonder if he knows how parallel this runs."

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I’ll have to play those.

#### QUESTION

I can actually get you a copy.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You can get me a copy? Hey, get me copies! Yeah, hey, he works for Microsoft!

#### QUESTION

For real.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Okay. I’ve got a 360. Epic Games sent me a 360 so I might as well play with it!

#### QUESTION

Is that for the Mistborn...?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

No, I’m working with Epic on something else. I’ll be able to announce that eventually, but Epic’s got a studio in Salt Lake and so I’ve been working with them on something. But that’s not official so I can’t say anything about that.
