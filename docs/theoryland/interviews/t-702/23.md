#### Question

To Isaac, the... artist?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Isaac is the interior artist for a lot of my books.

#### QUESTION

So my wife is an artist. When you do the cover art, do you actually go through and read the book before you design the art, because her biggest problem is that the covers don’t actually reflect what’s going on in the inside of the book.

#### Isaac Stewart

I haven’t done any of the cover art.

#### QUESTION

Oh, you’re the interior art.

#### ISAAC STEWART

However, I’m in the process of designing a book for a New York publisher and I’ve found that in some cases the cover that the author wants and the cover that the publisher wants is something different. And the publisher in most cases knows better where they want to sell it and who they want to market it to, than the author. So that’s why, a lot of times there’s a discrepancy between what’s inside and what’s on the outside.

#### BRANDON SANDESON

I’ve heard from publishers that they consider the cover art to be a poster for the book, not an illustration of the book, and those are two different things.
