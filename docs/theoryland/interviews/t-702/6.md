#### Question

Do you think writing Robert Jordan’s books affected your writing style in any way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It did. It affected me, you know, It definitely affected me. Robert Jordan was very good at some very important things. He was great with viewpoint, he was very good at foreshadowing and subtlety. In fact, I think he was way more subtle than I’ve been, and I think those are things I’ve learned by working on this project. And also, just being able to balance so many different characters and viewpoints. That’s something I think I learned. Though you know, I consciously when I wrote Alloy of Law, which is next, I consciously said, you know, I think I’m going to use a different style. There are some people who love the Wheel of Time, there are some people who don’t like the Wheel of Time, and I don’t want to become, you know, my style to become the Wheel of Time style. It’s my own style. The Way of Kings is certainly more like Wheel of Time, you know, but also more like all the classic epics and fantasy that I read. Alloy of Law is intentionally not like that. Alloy of Law is more of a fast-paced thriller plotting style than it is epic fantasy.
