#### Question

I’m relatively new to fantasy. For the Mistborn series, I’m curious: do you find out the origins of Ruin and Preservation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

...Eventually, eventually. You should talk to these guys. (signals to 17th Sharders) They’ll talk your ears off, and then some. Eventually perhaps you will.

#### MI'CHELLE

(laughter) Liar!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Well, they know some things.

#### MI'CHELLE

Just go to 17thshard.com and plan a LOT of time.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

They’ve got big theories because all my books are connected, so yes. They have lots of theories talking about that.
