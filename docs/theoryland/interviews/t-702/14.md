# [Interview #702, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=702#14)

#### Question

So, Michael Whelan did the cover for The Way of Kings, and I read that Tom Doherty called him up personally and asked him to do it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, he did.

#### QUESTION

Are there any plans for him to continue to do them, like Darrel K. Sweet has done for the Wheel of Time?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He’s a very busy man. He said that, if it fits in the schedule, yes he will. But since we don’t even have book two written yet, we don’t know. He’s my favorite artist, so that would be wonderful. But, we will see.
