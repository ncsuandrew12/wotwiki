#### Josh

Is Aona's Shard name Devotion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, but that’s more of a “Email that question to me” because I would have to look at my computer to see which term I settled on, but you’re basically there.

#### MI'CHELLE

We've got the right idea.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I think it actually may be Devotion. So I’ll have to look. It may be a synonym.

#### JOSH

Is Skai Unity?

(Brandon seems confused by the pronunciation. It is apparently more like "Skae")

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Um, RAFO

#### JOSH

Passion?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

What? RAFO. I’m not going to tell you. You already kind of pulled out of me what Aona was.

#### Footnote

We have emailed him, haven’t heard a response yet
