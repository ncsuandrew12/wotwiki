#### Question

I don't actually have a question. It's: Thank you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh! My pleasure.

#### Question

I follow you on Facebook and that really helps. Thank you. It makes you real.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

My pleasure. Yeah, follow me on Facebook or on Twitter, I try to post at least one thing a day. Often Iâ€™m posting more. Some of them are stupid. Some of the things are dumb things my kid does, but I also do updates on writing and things like that.

#### QUESTION

I would have to disagree. You've never posted anything stupid! Thank you very much.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Thank you guys very much for reading!
