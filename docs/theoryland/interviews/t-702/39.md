#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, well, that’s one of the reasons why Feruchemy has been split because it’s very diluted now. The Terris people did survive because they made it. And so, the genetic code is there.

#### QUESTION

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah. But that’s why there aren’t very many full-blooded Feruchemists anymore. A thousand years of the Lord Ruler trying to breed it out of the population followed by a cataclysm that destroyed most of the population of the world did them in, yeah.
