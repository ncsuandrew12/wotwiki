#### Question

How will Bela be important at the end of Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, Bela is either the Creator or the Dark One. Weâ€™re not, you know... (laughter). And so basically, Bela will be important in all aspects of the book, and none at the same time. Kind of like Vishnu.
