#### Question

For Warbreaker you did awesome annotations, and I was wondering, are you going to do that with any of your other books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Warbreaker has, Mistborn has all the annotations. Yeah, if you go look them up. [To Peter:] We have annotations for Alloy of Law, right? (laughter) I did those? Did I send them to you? I’m pretty sure I wrote them. I don’t have annotations for Way of Kings. The project was just too big to do that for at that point. I may eventually do them, but at this stage, there are not annotations for Way of Kings. But, there should be ones for Alloy of Law. And there are ones for all of the Mistborns.
