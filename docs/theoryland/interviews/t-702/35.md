#### Question

Do you have any considerations for ever turning any of your works into a movie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I’ve sold rights on Alcatraz and those eventually lapsed. They had the option for three years. I’ve sold rights on Mistborn. That’s still going strong. I’ve had inquiries about a couple of others. I can’t say, though, because there’s nothing sure. Though we did do the Mistborn video game and the handshake, is essentially a done deal now. We’ve just got to get the contract, fine details nailed down. Yes. Mistborn video game is a go. It’s for sure.

#### QUESTION

Tentative dates?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

2013. Fall.

#### QUESTION

Which company?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I can’t say that, though it is going to be cross-platform, all three major platforms, so PC, 360, and PS3. The plan right now is that it is going to be a prequel. (Everyone “oooohs”) So it’ll have new story and I’ll be writing the story.
