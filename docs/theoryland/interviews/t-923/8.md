# [Interview #923: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#8)

#### Galgóczi Móni

When you first began writing the WoT series, did you consider that it would become so voluminous?

#### Robert Jordan

When I started all of this, I knew what the last scene would be. At first, I thought it would be five or six volumes. Every time I sat down to actually write the book, I thought about all of the events that have to happen throughout the story and which of these things have to be included in the actual book. And then when I started writing, I realized that many of the original plans wouldn't fit into one book, so they were carried over. As a result, we have published ten books and have two or three more to go. Although really, I can only hope for that, because anything is possible.
