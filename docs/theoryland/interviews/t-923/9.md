# [Interview #923: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#9)

#### Galgóczi Móni

It is clear from your words that you would like to write down your dreams. How do you feel about the time and energy invested in proportion to the success?

#### Robert Jordan

Since I have a strong ego like any other writer, I expected some success, but the actual extent of it surprised me. I will admit it is a very, very nice feeling.
