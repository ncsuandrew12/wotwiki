#### Galgóczi Móni

What do you think of the computer games and role playing games based on the series?

#### Robert Jordan

I haven't played any of them, but my family and friends who have tried them gave them good reviews. I rarely play games, truth to tell; I tend to play chess on my machine.

#### Galgóczi Móni

Have you had any experience with role playing games?

#### Robert Jordan

Back when my son was little [Editor's note: he is 34 now], we played with his friends and I was the storyteller.

#### Galgóczi Móni

How long did that last?

#### Robert Jordan

About three years.
