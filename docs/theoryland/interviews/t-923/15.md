#### Galgóczi Móni

Into how many languages were these books translated?

#### Robert Jordan

I daresay it's into 22-23 languages. We most recently signed contracts with the Turkish, Taiwanese, and Korean publishers.

#### Galgóczi Móni

How satisfied are you with the translations and the covers of the books published in all the different countries?

#### Robert Jordan

Overall I am satisfied, though there are one or two countries where the appearance of the covers seems a bit odd to me.
