Your brother read a lot of books aloud to you when you were a child. What was your favorite book, and which one had the greatest impact on you?

#### Robert Jordan

*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*
is my favorite one, and the one that has had the biggest influence on me. Aside from that, I like works by John D. McDonald, Louis L'Amour, Robert A. Heinlein, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and Mark Twain.
