# [Interview #923, Entry #11]: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#11)

#### Galgóczi Móni

You had made a statement once somewhere that the best thing about being successful was that you could buy any book you wanted from the money you made. Can you tell me how many books you have in your home library?

#### Robert Jordan

At the moment, I have just over 13,000 hardcover books.

#### Galgóczi Móni

That is fantastic. Can you tell me how much and what type of books you've read, or read lately?

#### Robert Jordan

I get a lot of books from various places, and after reading them I pass them along to my friends. The reason for this is that I have a very good memory, and once I have read a book it remains in my mind, so I do not read the same books twice, because it is not as exciting, as I remember the whole story after reading the first few pages.

What type of books do I read? There are many best-sellers, mostly theological, historical, and scientific and technical works. It is important to me that I am interested in the book, but I often choose books based on reviews which appear in various journals. I'm actually omnivorous.

#### Galgóczi Móni

Do you have any favorites?

#### Robert Jordan

From the specialized work: Jared Diamond's
*Guns, Germs and Steel*
; otherwise, Lord of the Rings from Tolkien. But if you were to tell me now that you are going to take me with you to a desert island, and I will only be allowed to take one book, we would never get anywhere, because I could not choose which one to take with me.
