Budapest received her guest from afar with billowing gray clouds wreathing the hills of Budapest instead of her friendly, sunny face. We sat down in the hall of the Novotel because of the weather bordering on rain. Robert Jordan (born in 1948), who transposed his military carrier to writing, has arrived to the X. Budapest International Book Festival at the invitation of the Beholder Kiadó, where his aim—among other things—is to commemorate the latest volume of his extremely popular fantasy series called Wheel of Time.
