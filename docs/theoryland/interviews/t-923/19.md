When it comes to writing, whose opinion is the most valuable to you?

#### Robert Jordan

I care about Harriet's opinion only. She is the one who knows me, and she sees the finished materials first, so she is the one who is able to check and make sure that the story has everything that is needed for comprehension. After all, it may be that the story is complete in my head but I don't write everything down, so an outsider may not understand what I wanted to say. To make sure this doesn't happen, I listen to Harriet's advice.
