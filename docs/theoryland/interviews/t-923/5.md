Do you have a writer's creed?

#### Robert Jordan

I want to put my dreams onto paper, and I want to share them with people. I see myself as a late successor of the storytellers who lived in the Middle Ages. They traveled from village to village in the old times. When they arrived somewhere, they sat in the middle of the town or the edge of town, and put out their hats, and if they told good stories, they would have food, drink, and had a place to sleep. If the story was bad, then they had to go somewhere else.
