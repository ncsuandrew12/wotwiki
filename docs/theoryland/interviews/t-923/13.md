# [Interview #923: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#13)

#### Galgóczi Móni

Let's assume that you are reading your first novel right now, for the first time. Would you be satisfied, or would you make changes?

#### Robert Jordan

The first book was published thirteen years ago. As far as the story is concerned, I am perfectly happy with it; it is likely the same story that I would write now. But I have problems with the prose now, because now I can write a lot better. Otherwise, if there were no deadlines, I would probably rewrite the same book over and over.
