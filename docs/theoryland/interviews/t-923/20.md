# [Interview #923: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#20)

How did you meet your wife?

#### Robert Jordan

She worked for the publisher that released my first book. We met, we got to know each other, and I realized over the course of the third book that I wanted to marry her. It was awkward, because I was going to marry my only source of income. I solved the problem like this: I transferred my books to another publisher, but Harriet still edits my books.
