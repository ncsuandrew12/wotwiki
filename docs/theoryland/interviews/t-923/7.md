# [Interview #923: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#7)

Do you by chance believe in reincarnation?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I don't. Actually, in my dilettante way, I study the legends and myths and their similarities and their relationships to each other. With a long view, the definition of fantasy can be traced there because this genre uses supernatural things but treats them as if they were real. Many people write fantasy, deliberately or not—well, they don't admit it, and what is more, they deny it because it is not really considered high literature. For example, I think the art of magical realism belongs to the fantasy genre, but I'm sure if I were to say so to one of these authors, he or she would not be happy.
