# [Interview #923: Ekultúra: Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=923#3)

#### Galgóczi Móni

My sources tell me that you are a passionate pipe-smoker. One of my friends thinks that pipe-smokers see the world totally differently. Is this true?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think so, but the idea is very good. I will use it someday, somewhere.
