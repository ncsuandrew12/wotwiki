# [Interview #706: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Orome & Fejicus, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=706#2)

#### Orome

I also asked what project he would like to tackle next.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm assuming he meant after Stormlight Two. He said he really would like to get
*Elantris*
2 out in time for the 10th anniversary addition of
*Elantris*
, which will have extra art and other bits in it. after that one, he says he would love to do another stand alone, and said
*The Silence Divine*
would be his choice.
