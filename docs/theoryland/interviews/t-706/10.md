# [Interview #706: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Orome & Fejicus, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=706#10)

#### Fejicus

I made a comment about the role mythology plays in WoT, and if Brandon was planning on using any real world mythological parallels for the Stormlight Archive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he said that while they play a huge role in WoT, that if he were to include mythological parallels in Stormlight, that they would be parallels of Roshar's own mythology. (So perhaps were going to see Kaladin/Dalinar paralleling the Heralds?)
