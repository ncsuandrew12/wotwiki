# [Interview #706: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Orome & Fejicus, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=706#1)

#### Orome

This post is for anything info that was gleaned at the recent signing at Forbidden Planet in London.

To start with, The question i asked him was, 'Is Shalash the lady smashing up the art in
*The Way of Kings*
?'

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was apprehensive to say it out loud, but he wrote in my copy of
*Alloy of Law*
'Shalash appears in
*The Way of Kings*
'! I shall get a scan of that once i am able, and ill put it up in here. He also said to me 'you'd be surprised at how many of the Heralds appear in the book', so i guess another re-read is in order!

#### Footnote

Brandon has also
[hinted](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=4001)
that Jezrien was in the book. (See
