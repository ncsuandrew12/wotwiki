# [Interview #706: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Orome & Fejicus, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=706#3)

#### Fejicus

Hey, so me and 3 of my friends flew over from Ireland to go to this signing, so as a result Brandon was very happy to give us extra time to ask questions, and even stayed around for an extra 25-30 mins talking to us after his 4 hours of study, he's such a nice guy!
Anyway, we asked him a tonne of questions, and i'll get my mates to register here to add their questions to this thread, or i'll make another post when they send me their info!
