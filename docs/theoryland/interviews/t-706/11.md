# [Interview #706: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Orome & Fejicus, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=706#11)

#### Fejicus

Concerning the Radiants' shardplates, and the glyphs on them that Dalinar had never seen before, is there any relation to these and the AonDor? Could they perhaps act as an added focus?

#### Brandon Sanderson

From what I recall, he didn't really give a definitive answer on this one, but he seemed as if we were in the right direction.
