# [Interview #212: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#8)

#### Robert Jordan

For Gillmadin, I actually had comparatively few notes when I sold the books to Tor. They built up considerably over the writing of
*The Eye of the World*
, and still more later. To give an example, for
*Eye*
, I had considerable notes about the Aes Sedai, about Andor, the Two Rivers, Shienar, the Ways and the history of the world, but my notes on, say Cairhien, were much sketchier. When I needed to write about Cairhien, though, I fleshed those notes out. I didn't begin writing the Wheel of Time until after I was finished with writing the Conan novels, but some of the ideas that would become tWoT were kicking around in my head before I began
*The Fallon Blood*
.
