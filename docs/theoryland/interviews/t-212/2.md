#### Robert Jordan

For Deadsy, the last book I completed was Walter Mosley's
*Cinnamon Kiss*
. I just started Neil Gaiman's
*Anansi Boys*
. And I'm ashamed to say that when I first saw your post on Wotmania about having a secret, I thought, "Ah-ha! Palm or hairbrush?" Just following the context, and your blushes. Then I realized what it was. Thank you for keeping the secret.
