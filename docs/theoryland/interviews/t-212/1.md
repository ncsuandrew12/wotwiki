# [Interview #212: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#1)

#### Robert Jordan

My, this could get addictive. I hope you guys realize that I'll be going silent this weekend, for the duration of the tour. But I'll try to get in another post or two before then. No promises, however.

First off, apologies to everyone if I misspell your screen name. It seems that may turn out to be a bad habit I can't break. Spell-check is no help at all, of course.
