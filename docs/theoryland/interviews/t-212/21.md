# [Interview #212: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#21)

#### Robert Jordan

For ems, I really don't mind that some of you hate characters, and I don't mind the spam. Sometimes I read the theories, and if you mean by listen to the debates, read the posted discussions, then yes, I do, sometimes. This is very much a sometime thing, though. I don't have much time to lurk, so I drift around until I see what seems an interesting thread and peek in.
