# [Interview #212: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=212#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For Corin Ashaman, I've never changed anything because of a post. I did think of doing so when I first discovered the online community. I'd see someone who had figured out where I was going with something and think that I should change it just to keep the surprise factor. But there was always somebody else, often a lot of somebodies, who would post explaining why the first post just had to be wrong. So I went ahead and did what I had planned to do. Now, when somebody figures out what's what, I just think that's somebody who's on the ball and go on with my writing.
