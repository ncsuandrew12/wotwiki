# [Interview #503: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Gemmell Voting, Wheel of Time Article, Audible Tournament Winner + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=503#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Voting has begun](http://gemmellaward.com/page/vote-for-the-legend-here)
for the David Gemmell Legend Award, which I mentioned
[last week](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/883/)
. It will continue through May 31st. Both
*Warbreaker*
and
*The Gathering Storm*
are among the five nominees, but if you're struggling to pick one I'd recommend
*The Gathering Storm*
since I feel it's more in the spirit of Mr. Gemmell's work.

There's a great article on Robert Jordan, Harriet, and finishing the Wheel of Time
[in the
*Charleston City Paper*](http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/Content?oid=1900913)
. I'm not sure about the print edition, but online it's listed as the cover story.

*The Gathering Storm*
has won Audible's 3rd Annual Tournament of Audiobooks, defeating
*The Help*
in the final round. Wow! Since this is a fan-voted award, I'm honored that you decided to give it the nod. I'm sure Mr. Jordan is also pleased. Performers Michael Kramer and Kate Reading have many fans as well; if you haven't had a chance to check out the Wheel of Time series on audiobook, give it a try.
