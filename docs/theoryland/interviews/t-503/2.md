#### Brandon Sanderson

Speaking of audiobooks, over at Fantasy Literature they've posted
[reviews of both audio versions of
*Warbreaker*](http://www.fantasyliterature.com/sandersonbrandon.html#warbreakergraphicaudio)
. There are also reviews of my other titles on that page, and many other reviews throughout the site.

In the most recent podcast episode of Writing Excuses, Dan, Howard, and I
[brainstorm story concepts](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/04/11/)
using ideas from science. We started out by using a New Scientist article called "
[13 More Things We Don't Understand](http://www.newscientist.com/special/13-more-things)
". Check it out.

In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations I talk about
[the beginning of Vin's climax and her fight with the Inquisitors](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/347/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Seventy-Two)
,
[Marsh and the earring](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/348/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Seventy-Two-Part-2)
, and
[cinematic writing](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/349/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Seventy-Three)
. We're getting close to the end . . . I guess I should start putting up the
*Warbreaker*
annotations soon.

Finally, my good friend
[Janci Patterson](http://raisinfish.livejournal.com/)
just got her first fiction sale: her YA novel
*Skipped*
was bought by Christy Ottaviano at Henry Holt. I couldn't be more pleased for her; I gave her some comments on the book (I basically thought it was brilliant). Janci also gave me some comments on
*The Way of Kings*
that proved invaluable in writing the final draft; if you're following me on
[Twitter](http://twitter.co/BrandSanderson)
or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
you heard a little more about that. You may also recognize Janci from the
[Mistborn 3 chapter 30 annotations](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/294/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Thirty-Part-2)
. Anyway, I assume Janci's book will be out in 2011 or 2012, after which you can all buy it and find out for yourself how great it is.
