# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#19)

#### Isabel

I don't really remember anymore what I asked RJ, but I do remember that Liandra and I asked if Robert Jordan and Harriet wanted to join the Nynaeve fanclub. They did want to join it. :-) Now it's called the Official Nynaeve Fanclub.

We also talked about my age again and I told RJ I would bring my passport Saturday, because I couldn't make it to the Friday signings. :-)
