#### Question

In
*New Spring*
there were still a lot of them [Malkieri], but nowadays Lan is the only one around: how's that possible? Did they all die?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it's a matter of assimilation. All these people now think of themselves as part of the country they live in; they've taken on these new cultures. Lan is the only one who hasn't done this, who at heart remains a Malkieri.
