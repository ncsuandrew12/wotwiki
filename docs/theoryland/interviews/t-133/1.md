# [Interview #133, Entry #1]: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#1)

#### Isabel

While Jordan was visiting the Netherlands, there were railway strikes going on. So it was really hard to get to Amsterdam. At the end I and Wolf Gaidin arrived just in time. We met up in Utrecht and traveled to Amsterdam.

This report was written by Aan'allein. I have edited some comments out.

I am putting my own comments in between, so you will have some idea how I felt during it. :-)
