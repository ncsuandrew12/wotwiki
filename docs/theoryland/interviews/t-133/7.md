#### Question

How many times does Jordan rewrite each chapter?

#### Robert Jordan

As many times as needed. Each time he makes a major change, he saves the file with a new revision number. For
*Winter's Heart*
, the prologue had 97 revisions. This was by far the largest amount, most chapters only have nine or ten revisions.
