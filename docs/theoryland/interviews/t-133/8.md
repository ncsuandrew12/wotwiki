# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#8)

#### Question

Does he use books to fix things from earlier books? (Clearly asking about the Shaido's attack at Dumai's Wells, although I'm not sure Jordan realized this.)

#### Robert Jordan

No, he doesn't. He sometimes tries to clear up misconceptions that people have gotten. (He does admit that there have been times that he has made mistakes [put down a wrong eye-color (probably a reference to the Faile/Moiraine gaze at Perrin in
*The Dragon Reborn*
) / blinked and missed an editor's typo], but this is not what he's talking about.)

But he does try to use things that have been there a long time, and he likes to plant seeds, so that things don't fall out of the blue sky (the major reason I love WoT so much). Giving us the little tidbits of information that don't mean anything now, but that in three books will come around again. The question about how many of these seeds there are got RAFOd.
