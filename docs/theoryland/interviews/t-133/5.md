# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#5)

#### Aan'allein

Sitting in the back of the room, my memo-recorder didn't pick up very much, but the following is what I can make out of it and remember as answers to a question about how he created the Old Tongue (always a topic some people are very interested in):

#### Robert Jordan

—There is no simple standard way to make plurals, to shift the irregular verb, it's all adapted because of the merging of different languages. (Just like around 900 AD when the Saxons encountered the Danes and began creating a Lingua Franca, so the Old Tongue is also supposed to have been created by mixing different languages, and thus has a lot of the same sort of irregularities as English has.)

—He started with that list of 880 English words with which you should be able to manage in 95% of English conversations, removed what he found unnecessary and added others he needed.
