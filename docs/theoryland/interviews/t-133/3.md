# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#3)

#### Aan'allein

The first thing I heard when I came in was a question about how he researched things.

#### Robert Jordan

He talked about Perrin making that barrelstave in
*The Dragon Reborn*
, said that he'd done a lot of research into 18th- and 19th-century blacksmithing (and couldn't find anything from before). Then he wrote the first version and sent it to a blacksmith, who gave a lot of useful critique.
