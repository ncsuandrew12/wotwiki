# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#2)

#### Aan'allein

I sat down in the back of the room, looking around, but spotted no one familar besides the 'Amyrlin' of that Nynaeve fanclub (
*why was I not surprised?*
). Jordan was the same as ever, except that this time he wasn't wearing sunglasses. Oh, and I think Harriet was there as well, or at least a woman who was very familar with him...

Anyway, there were a lot of standard questions again, and a lot of the standard answers. Several times word for word the same things I'd heard the day before, and read in transcripts before that. Still, a couple of interesting things came up.
