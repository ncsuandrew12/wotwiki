# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#17)

#### Aan'allein

Then the questions were over and it was time for signing.

A big triumph for me here. We were asked to write down our names beforehand, so that Jordan wouldn't waste a lot of time on asking for the spelling. When I got there, he barely glanced at the paper, looked at me and said "Hello, Sander".

Wheee! He remembered me. I'm going to have a problem tomorrow (err, today that is). I can only use one side of the tape in my memo-recorder, because I'm so not going to tape over those words now... I need a computer with a microphone very quickly, so that I can save those wonderful words. (On the other hand, he'll probably say them again at least three more times.)
