# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#10)

#### Robert Jordan

The standard 'Harriet saying you've been writing Padan Fain again, haven't you?' anecdote came along. [Now I remember that the character he mentioned actually writing was Semirhage.]

He again mentioned the list of writers: Holdstock, Powers, Ford, Friedman, Jones.

He likes George R.R. Martin's books, gave him a quote for his first book.
