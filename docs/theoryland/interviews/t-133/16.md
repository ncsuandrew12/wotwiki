# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#16)

#### Aan'allein

Miss Nynaeve-fan asked a question, standing up very formal together with another girl.

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, well you're gonna sing...

#### Isabel

No.

#### Robert Jordan

No? what?

#### Isabel

Is Nynaeve self-assured?

#### Robert Jordan

Is Nynaeve self-assured?

#### Isabel

Or is she just pretending to be?

#### Robert Jordan

No, Nynaeve is self-assured.

#### Isabel

YES!! \*almost bounces through the roof\*

(I had a bet with the other Amyrlin of the Offical Nynaeve Fanclub and of course I won.)
