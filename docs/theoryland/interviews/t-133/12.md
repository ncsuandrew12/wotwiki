#### Robert Jordan

He begins to realize more things about a character as he writes it. The major characters were in his head from the beginning, the secondary level and even most of the tertiary characters as well. The minor characters you'll only see for a page or two are however often invented on the spot.

#### Question

So you don't consider Shaidar Haran a major character?

#### Robert Jordan

Ah, oh yes, he's a major character. Definitely a major player.
