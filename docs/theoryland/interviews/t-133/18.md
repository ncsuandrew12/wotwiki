# [Interview #133: Amsterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=133#18)

#### Aan'allein

When Damer Flinn and Sarene and Corele attacked Demandred, how far away were they? In yards, meters, ...?

#### Robert Jordan

Ah...no, they were eh... [long silence while he's thinking] no, no, no...Damer Flinn and Corele eh... no, no, that's meters...just some meters. Err, they couldn't have come face-to-face. That's eh... Yeah, it's not a short, not a really...not like you and me.

#### Aan'allein

...he didn't see the ageless faces...

#### Robert Jordan

... [nothing really, he was done signing then, but no contradiction either]

#### Aan'allein

The general idea I now have is that it was something like 10, maybe 20 meters between them. Not the 100+ meters I'd kinda expected.

All in all it was a pretty short session, but well worth it, even with all the added travel time.
