#### Austin Teen Book Festival

Did you own
*Thriller*
by Michael Jackson in the 80s?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did own
*Thriller*
, I can proudly say. Great album. I have a very distinct memory of my brother Jordan and I in the old house we had. I was younger than ten, and we were sitting at the kitchen table staring at a cassette player and listening to "Beat It". I remember the two of us just being in awe of this cool music. Mom walked in, tried to figure out what the lyrics were, and said, "What is this?" She was used to us listening to kids' music, and suddenly we'd discovered Michael Jackson! She was just kind of flabbergasted that her boys were growing up and discovering pop music. My brother went on to get the
*Thriller*
video for his birthday that year.
