# [Interview #918: AMOL Signing Report - Asha'Gerard, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=918#2)

#### Asha'Gerard

I asked if Harriet would explain how Rand lit his pipe. She was (as you would guess) evasive on the matter. I did my best to try to pin her down on it and the main points I got were:

#### Harriet McDougal

"That was exactly as Jim wrote it."
  
"He wanted to leave you feeling that the next Age will be even stranger than the last."

#### Asha'Gerard

I asked if Rand now had some powers of the Creator & she again reiterated (maybe clarified?) that the next Age will be profoundly different.

So I then asked if that ability is going to be exclusively Rand's & she spread her hands to give me a look that said "maybe, maybe not".

The vibe I got from her is that she didn't really know what her husband meant for that to mean and she didn't want to say one way or another, but that is just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.
