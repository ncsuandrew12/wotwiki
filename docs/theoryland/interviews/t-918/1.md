# [Interview #918: AMOL Signing Report - Asha'Gerard, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=918#1)

#### Asha'Gerard

I was there at the San Diego event, and because about a third of the people raised their hands when Brandon asked "Who hasn't read the book yet?" (the other 2/3 expressed a very vocal "aww"), the "on record" questions were extremely brief (I think no more than 10 were asked). We had to ask our own questions in private when it was our turn to get our books signed.
