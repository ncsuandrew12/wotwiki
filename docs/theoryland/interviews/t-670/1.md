# [Interview #670: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Darrell Sweet, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=670#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

For those who do not know, Darrell Sweet—illustrator of all of the Wheel of Time covers—
[has passed away](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/12/darrell-k-sweet-1934-2011)
.

The first of his covers I can remember seeing was his beautiful cover for
*The Eye of the World*
. I'm sure it wasn't actually the first, however. Mr. Sweet was one of the premier fantasy artists for many years in the business. I have a healthy appreciation of what he accomplished, and I'm not sure many new readers realize just how influential and important he was as an illustrator.
