# [Interview #670: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Darrell Sweet, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=670#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

(As a side note, people are wondering about the last Wheel of Time cover. Mr. Sweet did finish a concept, which I have seen, but did not finish the entire illustration. No decision has been made yet whether another artist will take this concept and do a final piece according to it, or if the book cover will be scrapped and a new concept done. I will let you know.)
