# [Interview #978: Advertising Some of my Smaller Projects - Fantasy Faction Q&A, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=978#3)

#### Hoosay

So while writing two massive books in Memory of Light and Stormlight 2 you found time to write (at least) four novellas? I'm not going to ask how you manage it, I just want to know how you stop your fingers falling off?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Well, two of these are older. (The ones that are free on my website.) The other two I wrote while traveling, when it's difficult to manage something as in-depth as the WoT/SA.

But the real answer is that if I spend too long editing, and not enough time actually writing, I find myself burrowing down for a week and wanting to write something new. This is where a lot of these side projects come from.
