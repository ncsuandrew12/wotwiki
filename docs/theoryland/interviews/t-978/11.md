# [Interview #978: Advertising Some of my Smaller Projects - Fantasy Faction Q&A, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=978#11)

Hi, I could be wrong, but I think I read somewhere thay your writing an Urban Fantasy? Just double checking that:P

I wrote one as a 'for fun' deviation during a break about a year and a half ago. I do this often, experimenting. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This time, it was fun, but it wasn't high enough quality to release. Perhaps I will re-visit it, but more likely, I will leave it alone. Any artist creates 'b-sides' so to speak as they practice different styles and experiment. This was one of mine, and I don't like the idea of releasing something that didn't turn out well enough.
