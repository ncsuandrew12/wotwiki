I saw the question asked, but I did not see an answer. I noticed you listed one reason of doing these project yourself is to create nice, collectible print versions. Where/when can we pre-order our copies?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Legion is up for pre-order on the website. I think they have a certain number of signed, numbered editions and then a general edition for cheaper.
The Emperor's Soul isn't up for pre-order quite yet. I suspect they'll do it soon.
The last one is something I'll be taking to cons this summer. (I'm a guest of SD Comicon, Gencon, and Dragoncon all this year.) I don't know if I'll have it done in time for San Diego, but it should be ready for the others. I will have plenty left over to sell on my website for those who want one. There's no real 'order' for this yet. I'll try to do another post when these are all ready for sale.
Right now, the focus is on Legion, which is up for order and coming out soonest.
