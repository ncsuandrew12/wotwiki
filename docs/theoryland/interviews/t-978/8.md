Well, I don't want to wait until 2013 for the next Stormlight book! However, I will be content reading your side novellas. Is there a way to download them for my kindle?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes. The two new ones will have ebook launches at the same time (or soon after) the print editions come out. They'll be on the kindle store.

The older two are on my website for free, though one is on the kindle store already. (Firstborn.) $.99

I'll see what I can do about getting the other one on Kindle soon.
