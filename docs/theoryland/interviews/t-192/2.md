#### Robert Jordan

For an overview of who appears in
*Knife of Dreams*
: Elayne Trakand's struggle for the throne of Andor reaches its culmination. The relationship between Mat Cauthon and Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, heir to the Seanchan throne, also reaches a culmination in a most unusual way. Perrin Aybara rescues his wife Faile from the Shaido finally, and that also comes about in not exactly the way that anybody's going to expect. And there are other minor story lines that get wrapped up, but as I say, other story lines get advanced. And Rand al'Thor, I've heard it said that Rand al'Thor does not appear in this book as often as some people would like. But he has a few chapters and the chapters where he appears are choice.
