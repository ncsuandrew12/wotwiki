# [Interview #649: COT Signing Report - Ajierene, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=649#8)

#### Ajierene

I asked if there were any female Fades.

#### Robert Jordan

Again Mr. Jordan looked up (by that time he was about to sign the next book). He told me how one does not see women Trollocs since they are really just baby machines. Apparently they are barefoot and pregnant somewhere deep in the Blight. Fades are a throwback of Trollocs and no, no female Fades have ever been seen. OK, so the question was dodged a bit. His wife thought Fades were not gender specific, but Robert Jordan said they are. More food for thought.
