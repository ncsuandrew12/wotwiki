# [Interview #649: COT Signing Report - Ajierene, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=649#9)

#### Ajierene

Unfortunately the answers to these two questions sparked a multitude of more questions, but I did not want to bother the man too much.

At a little after 7:00 pm, I left the library and headed to my car. I walked out with Sean and discussed how nice Mr. Jordan was, not at all arrogant, like I had heard. He agreed and noted how similar the languages are. Now I am off to feverishly read the
*Crossroads of Twilight*
and catch up with the rest of you.
