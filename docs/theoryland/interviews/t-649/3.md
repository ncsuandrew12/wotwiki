# [Interview #649: COT Signing Report - Ajierene, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=649#3)

#### Ajierene

I called Gerald up and we brainstormed some ideas for questions. I brainstormed with Sean also and discussed how similar the Old Tongue is to his friend's gypsy language. We were ushered to stand against the wall while we waited. Then ushered to stand in the middle of the hallway. Perhaps the Library staff was bored. We discussed the sign on the wall:

> Robert Jordan will not sign mass produced paperbacks
>   
> Questions are allowed, photographs are allowed
>   
> Robert Jordan will sign 2 books per trip through the line:
>   
> 10 books, 2 books per trip = 5 trips

So that's why people were running to the back of the line when they were done getting their books signed.

Finally our turn came.
