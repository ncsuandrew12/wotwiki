# [Interview #649: COT Signing Report - Ajierene, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=649#6)

#### Ajierene

I asked if Trollocs could ever do good.

#### Robert Jordan

He looked up from where he was about to sign my book and told me, "â€¦.Trollocs could do good as easily as you could cut up a baby. It just isn't in their nature." Food for thought, so to speak.
