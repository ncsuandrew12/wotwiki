# [Interview #649: COT Signing Report - Ajierene, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=649#1)

#### Ajierene

It was Tuesday night and I left work a bit late, for once. Headed to Philadelphia to meet the great Robert Jordan and get a book signed. The Free Library of Philadelphia was where the signing would be and a bookstore was selling the books there also. Good thing, because I did not buy a book before this, hearing that Mr. Jordan only signs books that are bought at the store he is doing the signing at. Of course this being a library, I was a bit confused at first.
