# [Interview #142: Wotmania and Dragonmount Q&A, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#26)

#### Question

Do you ever feel like other fantasy writers are envious of the success that WoT has attained?

#### Robert Jordan

I shouldn't think so. I mean, I'm not jealous of Stephen King, and he has a lot more success than I do. So do a number of other writers. Some people sell fewer books than you do, and some people sell more. There really isn't any point in jealousy. You just keep trying to write the best book you can. Besides, remember that
*Moby Dick*
was both a commercial and a critical flop when it was first published. Anybody want to try naming the top ten sellers of that year? I didn't think so. Of course, I hope for the longevity of
*MobyDick*
(I don't think there is a writer who doesn't!) but I trust you get the point.
