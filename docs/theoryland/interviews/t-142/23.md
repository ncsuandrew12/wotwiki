# [Interview #142, Entry #23]: Wotmania and Dragonmount Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#23)

#### Question

Was Erian Boroleos meant to disappear during the battle at Shadar Logoth or was that a mistake?

#### Robert Jordan

Erian Boroleos was not meant to disappear. In my notes, she is placed guarding those with Cadsuane who cannot channel and not too pleased about it (there are reasons why she was chosen out for this, which I won't go into here), and there is even a note (under CHECKS AND CORRECTIONS, a category I use to make sure that I haven't blinked at the wrong time) to make sure of mentioning her in passing. It didn't happen, for which, mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. I was so certain that I had done it, that I didn't find out I hadn't until the paperback came out, but a correction will be made.
