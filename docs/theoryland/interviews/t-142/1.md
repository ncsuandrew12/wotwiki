# [Interview #142: Wotmania and Dragonmount Q&A, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#1)

#### Dragonmount and Wotmania

At last! Having just recently finished
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, Robert Jordan agreed to answer questions from Dragonmount and wotmania.com. Both sites collected well over 1,000 questions before narrowing them down to what you see here. Thank you to everyone who submitted questions. We're very sorry that many of the good ones submitted never made it in. There's always next time!

We are very proud that this is an interview without a single "Read On And Find Out" answer.

We also interviewed Harriet McDougal, Robert Jordan's wife & Editor. Be sure to check out
[that interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=146)
as well.
