# [Interview #142: Wotmania and Dragonmount Q&A, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#24)

#### Question

In
*Winter's Heart*
, Min doesn't recognize Birgitte, but they were in Salidar at the same time. What is the story there?

#### Robert Jordan

No story at all. In Salidar, Min knew Birgitte as a adventurer, you might say, but not until Caemlyn did she realize that Birgitte was, in fact, BIRGITTE BY GOD SILVERBOW!
