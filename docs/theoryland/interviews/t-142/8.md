# [Interview #142: Wotmania and Dragonmount Q&A, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#8)

#### Question

Do current events and world politics, such as the tragedy on September 11th, ever end up influencing the events within the books? If so, what are some examples?

#### Robert Jordan

Only by accident. Any writing is always filtered through the writer, and whatever the writer lives through always changes the filters, but I don't consciously set out to mirror current events in any way.
