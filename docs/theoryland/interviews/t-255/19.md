# [Interview #255: Robert Jordan's Blog: IT'S BEEN AWHILE, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=255#19)

#### Robert Jordan

For those of you who think the razor that Mat gave to Tuon is a zebra, it isn't. I was thinking of a horse I once saw a picture of, an American paint, which in memory seemed to fit my description (white meeting black along dead-straight lines) very closely. In fact, the memory fit so well that I decided not to check whether the actual horse looked the way I recalled it. The recollection made a terrific image.
