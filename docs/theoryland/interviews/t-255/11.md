# [Interview #255: Robert Jordan's Blog: IT'S BEEN AWHILE, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=255#11)

#### Robert Jordan

For kcf, the Terry Pratchett/J.K.Rowling broo-haha seems much overblown to me. J.K.Rowling said some silly things to which Terry made sensible replies only to have the headlines alter what he had said. And then the headline writers tried to cover themselves by altering the headlines online. Neil Gaiman, as near as I can make out, pointed this out. Enough said, and I wouldn't have dipped a toe in even if the sell-by date wasn't long past.
