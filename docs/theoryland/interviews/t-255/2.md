I've noticed here and there that some of you have caught errors—sometimes mine, sometimes printers' errors—and commented on them. When you do that, would you please give the chapter where you found the error and also the edition—American, British, hardcover, trade paperback etc—as well as the title, and the printing if you can. You can find the printing number on the same page with the copyright notice. In the American editions, there will be a line of numbers at the bottom of that page, something like this:

15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7

The last number in that line on the right is the number of that book's printing.

In the British editions, the entire printing history is given on the copyright page, a list of which years reprints occurred and how many times during that year.

That helps me to find where the error is located, if there is one. For example, somebody said that he or she found Verin channeling
*saidin*
in
*Lord of Chaos*
. Check as I can, I cannot find that anywhere in the book, and neither can my assistant Maria. Maybe it is there, but I can't find it.
