# [Interview #255: Robert Jordan's Blog: IT'S BEEN AWHILE, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=255#3)

#### Robert Jordan

I haven't been giving RAFOs much of late, mainly because some of you put entirely too much weight on that answer. Sometimes I give it because I intend to or might use something involving the answer in a future book and I don't want to give it away ahead of time. Sometimes I say RAFO because the answer, while not particularly important in and of itself, will give clues toward something I want to remain hidden a while longer. Rather than start empty arguments, I'm going to be sparing with the RAFOs, at least here in the blog.
