# [Interview #255: Robert Jordan's Blog: IT'S BEEN AWHILE, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=255#15)

#### Robert Jordan

For NapoleonCoplin, the part of a Dreamer that enters
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
can be thought of as the Dreamer's consciousness, but it is any case not corporate. That is, it has no physical reality outside of
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. A Dreamer might make a gateway from the Unseen World to the Waking World, but there would be nothing physical that could step through and exist outside of the Unseen World.
