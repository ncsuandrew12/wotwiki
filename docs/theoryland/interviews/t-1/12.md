#### Batlar

I'm curious, what happened to the Black Ajah's Warders? Did they kill them?

#### Robert Jordan

Those who did not die on the night that Liandrin and the others left, died not long thereafter. Not all of them
*had*
Warders, remember. And not just the Reds.

#### Footnote

RJ apparently changed his mind on this later; in
*Winter's Heart*
Chapter 10, we discover that Eldrith's Warder Kennit still lives. RJ commented further on the Warders of Black Ajah members
[in 1998](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#10)
