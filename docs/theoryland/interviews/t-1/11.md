Hi Mr. Jordan. I was at your conference yesterday on Compuserve but didn't get to finish asking the rest of my questions. At book signings: how many books do you sign per person and if asked would you sign a book in your real name and pen name?

#### Robert Jordan

Generally I sign as many books as anyone brings, but the practical limit is set by how many people there are and how much time I have to spend at that store. For the rest, are you saying Robert Jordan isn't my real name?

#### THopeB

Sharon, do you want to answer that?

#### Sharon

Nah.
