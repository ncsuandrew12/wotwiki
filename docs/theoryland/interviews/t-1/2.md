Hello, just to say I LOVE your books, I was wondering how long you will continue the saga, because I read in the prologue of the first book that the battle lasted about ten years? And it's only been about two up to the sixth book.

It will last several more books, until I reach the last scene, which has been in my head since the very beginning.
