# [Interview #1: AOL Chat 1, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1#1)

#### Robert Jordan

We're here. We don't know the private-chat commands.

#### THopeB

Ok, thought you were going to be here under another name. :)

Ok, everyone, let's get started! Tonight we have the honor of presenting the
*New York Times*
best-selling fantasy author Robert Jordan!

Tonight we'll be having a question and answer session and will be on full protocol meaning that if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment please type "!" or "?" onscreen and I'll call on you in turn. That way we won't have 20 conversations going on at one! That's "once". And Robert can answer your questions completely. One more thing after you're done asking or commenting, please type GA for "go ahead", so we can know when you're finished.

Well, I'm not going to have time to introduce you; let's get right to the questions!
