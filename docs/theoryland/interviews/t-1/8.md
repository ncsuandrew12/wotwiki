I was curious if you could clear something up for me. The Dragon Lews Therin ended the Age of Legends, but Rand Al'Thor is the next Dragon, and he's not coming out of the Age of Legends?

#### Robert Jordan

Jdieu, could you clarify? I'm not sure I understand the question.

#### Jdieu

Well, you write that Lews Therin ends the Age of Legends, that time repeats itself, and I would think that Rand would in turn be ending the repeated Age of Legends, but it doesn't appear to BE a repeated Age of Legends.

#### Robert Jordan

It doesn't follow that simply because the Age that Lews Therin ended is now called the Age of Legends, that this age which Rand lives in in any way is a repeat of that particular age. What is/was the Age of Legends
*will*
repeat eventually, but not until the Wheel turns considerably further.
