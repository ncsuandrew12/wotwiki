#### BelaHorse

Why did you choose to go with such an experimental style for
*Lord of Chaos*
? It seems to me that
*Lord of Chaos*
is really just half a book. Many characters become more fully fleshed out but very little happens. Some characters seem to develop positively, others negatively—but all within a framework of "wait, wait, wait..." How did you choose this approach?

#### Robert Jordan

Sorry—that's just the way it worked out.

#### Footnote

If the concept of
*Lord of Chaos*
being 'half a book' confuses you, see the footnote of
