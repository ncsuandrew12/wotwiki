#### Fable

I've always admired the incredible patience you show in your writing moving from major event to major event (like moving Rand from the Stone of Tear to the completion of events in the Aiel Waste). Do you have any precise method you use, or does that flow naturally? Do you ever write the events then fill in the spaces, so to speak?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I never "fill in the spaces." Sometimes I have to cut events out, because I've become entirely
*too*
patient, getting from one place to another. For the rest, I don't really have a "method" beyond telling the story.
