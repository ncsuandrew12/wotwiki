#### Phylwriter

I was wondering more what your "writing life" was like...you know, like an every day kinda thingâ€”could you tell us what a normal, RJ day is like?

#### Robert Jordan

Average day at beginning of book is: have breakfast, answer letters and telephone calls, then write for six to eight hours. Do this five days a week. After a while, this gets to be: drink a quart or two of strong coffee, write for twelve to fourteen hours a day, and do this seven days a week. Eventually the book is finished or I am dead.
