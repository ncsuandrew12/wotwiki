#### Pamela

After reading the first five books (thanks for many wonderful hours) and starting the sixth, I find myself wishing for a "Wheel of Time Encyclopedia"â€”something with longer glossary entries to help me remember who's who and who's done what. Any chance of that happening?

#### Robert Jordan

An Encyclopedia will have to wait until the Wheel of Time is finished, but the guys who did
*The Illustrated Guide to Pern*
and
*The Illustrated Guide to Amber*
are interviewing me next month for the same sort of book about the Wheel.
