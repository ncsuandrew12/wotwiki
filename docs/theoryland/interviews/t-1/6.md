#### Drayken

When did you decide to become a writer? Did you always want to write or did it come later in life?

#### Robert Jordan

At five, while reading
*Huckleberry Finn*
and
*Tom Sawyer*
, I decided I wanted to write, but I always thought I would do it "one day," after I had a practical career. Then I was injured and I had a lot of time on my hands, so I decided to put up or shut up about this "one day" stuff. To my surprise, somebody actually wanted to buy it, and that was that.
