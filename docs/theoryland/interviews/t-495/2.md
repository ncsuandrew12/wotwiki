#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Gathering Storm*
[was named as one of five nominees](http://www.audiopub.org/2010 finalists.pdf)
for the 2010 Audie awards in the category of science fiction/fantasy audiobook. Kudos to voice performers Michael Kramer and Kate Reading! If you haven't had a chance to give the Wheel of Time audiobooks a try, I highly recommend them.
