# [Interview #495, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Updates, Audies, Vote for the David Gemmell Legend Award!](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=495#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Now for this week's big news (though this is fighting with the Audies as far as how big it is).
*The Gathering Storm*
is on the long list of titles up for the David Gemmell Legend award (
*Warbreaker*
is also on the list, but I feel that
*The Gathering Storm*
is more in the spirit of Gemmell's work, which is part of the award's criteria).
*Hero of Ages*
made the short list last year and lost to
*Blood of Elves*
, and I was just honored to be nominatedâ€”until I found out that the winner gets a
*freaking battleaxe*
.

The award itself is in the shape of a Druss-style battleaxe, and it is awesome. If you want to help me and Team Jordan win one of these for
*The Gathering Storm*
. . . or rather, if you believe it's the most deserving of the books that have been nominated, go
