#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I've finally given up on doing my own taxes. For the last ten years, I've always been able to do them myself, but now things are just getting too complicated for me. Time to let the experts handle it.

There are a lot of strange tax issues wrapped up in being a writer. For one thing, there are the taxes related to your foreign sales. Some countries let you fill out a waver and prove that you're paying taxes in your home country, which—via tax treaties—lets you get away without paying income tax in the foreign country. Other places force you to pay taxes on your foreign income to that country, but then in the U.S. they allow you to take the amount paid as credits on your income tax here. Then, there are all of the messes having to do with self employment taxes, exemptions for business expenses, and a whole lot of other hoopla.
