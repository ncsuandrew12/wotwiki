# [Interview #485: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Doctors Without Borders, Interviews, THE WAY OF KINGS, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=485#4)

Finally, it looks like Amazon has put up
[a new page for
*The Way of Kings*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765326353?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
â€”and this time it's for the real thing, unlike the old page with its hilarious reviews. The page count they list is optimistic (the text would have to be tiny; depending on how the book is designed I expect the final count to be north of 800 pages), but the rest of it, including the release date, should be pretty much right. Assuming I get my revisions done on time and to my satisfaction! Right now I'm back hard at work at
*Towers of Midnight*
, which I'm guessing will come out more toward the end of November 2010 rather than exactly a year after
*The Gathering Storm*
. Anyway, there will be more here on
*The Way of Kings*
in the months to come. Stay tuned.
