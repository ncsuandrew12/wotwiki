Then there's my own podcast. Though they did a fine job without me during the tour (such as in
[last week's episode about NaNoWriMo](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/11/22/)
â€”by the way, how many of my fans won this year?), Howard Tayler and Dan Wells were happy to have me back for this week's Writing Excuses episode where we discussed
[mixing humor with drama and horror](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/12/01/)
. Check it out.

I've gotten a bit behind in mentioning the Mistborn 3 annotations. The most recent additions mention
[the creation of Inquisitors and how to defeat Ruin](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/306/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty)
,
[Spook as the Survivor of the Flames](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/307/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-One)
,
[Marsh \*spoiler\*ing Penrod](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/308/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-Two)
, and
[Yomen's backstory](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/309/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-Three)
.
