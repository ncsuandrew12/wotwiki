#### Brandon Sanderson

I did a few more radio and podcast interviews in the last couple of days. They'll probably be the last in a while; if you didn't get a chance to see me on the tour (a few Utah and Idaho events are still coming up), I said a lot of the same types of things on these shows as I said at my appearances. (Though for details and sometimes videos of my appearances you can check out Dragonmount's Storm Leader reports.) Today I recorded for a show on CNN radio that should be airing soon. I also appeared on
[David Lemberg's Science and Society podcast](http://scienceandsociety.net/2009/11/30/brandon-sanderson-the-gathering-storm-the-wheel-of-time-series/)
yesterday, as well as another appearance on the Louie b. Free show, where I really got to go in depth about this amazing phenomenon I've had the honor to be a part of. My first appearance was on
[November 3rd](http://www.vindy.com/louie-free/archives/2009/nov/03/)
(only the "Part One" link works, but that's the whole thing). My segment starts at the 3:03:14 mark (yes, that's three hours into the show). Scrubbing through the previous 3 hours I heard adult content disclaimers several times, so keep that in mind! My segment of yesterday's show starts at the 30:47 mark. Give them both a listen!

#### Footnote

The audio from the Louie b. free show on November 30, 2009 no longer appears to be available.
