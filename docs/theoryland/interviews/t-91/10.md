# [Interview #91, Entry #10]: TPOD Signing Report - Kevin Bartlett](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=91#10)

#### Kevin Bartlett

Well, that's all I scribbled down on the bus on the way home. Again, all in all it was somewhat of a letdown. But I did get four of my hardcovers signed. Of course, I quickly looked at the publishing information page of my
*The Eye of the World*
, but it was a fifth printing. I have firsts of
*The Dragon Reborn*
,
*The Fires of Heaven*
,
*Lord of Chaos*
,
*A Crown of Swords*
, and
*The Path of Daggers*
, but those last four are all pretty easy to get, I'm sure.

If any one is actually still reading, I'm impressed.
