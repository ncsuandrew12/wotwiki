#### Robert Jordan

At one point, someone made some comment about Orson Scott Card (which I didn't hear), and Jordan replied with a meaningful "Scott and I disagree on
*many*
things." I don't know what brought that on, but evidently the two have had some contact, enough to identify gaping differences. It was hard to miss the point of his comment; in fact, if I remember correctly, he said basically the exact same thing at least twice, and almost in succession.
