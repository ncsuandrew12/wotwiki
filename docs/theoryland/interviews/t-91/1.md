Hello all,

Last night I went to the Seattle signing at the UW bookstore, and all in all it was ... anticlimactic. Admission was ticketed, and in order to get a ticket, you had to have a receipt from the bookstore for
*The Path of Daggers*
,
*Legends*
or
*The World of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time*
. There were 350 tickets distributed, but more people showed up, and they waited in a first-come, first-served line. He would only sign two hardcover books per ticketholder from the WoT,
*Legends*
, or
*The World of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time*
.

Of approximately 400 people, I was the only person who tried to ask him plot-related questions, as far as I know.

He should really consider putting together a Signing FAQ: "Book 9 will be published shortly after I finish writing it." "There will be at least three more books in the series, and that's a minimum. I've known the last scene of the last book since I started writing, and the series will keep on going until I get there." He must have gotten really tired of giving those answers.
