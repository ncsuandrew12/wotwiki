# [Interview #91: TPOD Signing Report - Kevin Bartlett, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=91#3)

#### Kevin Bartlett

When an Aes Sedai turns Black Ajah, does she keep her Warder? If so, how is that accomplished?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO. Of course, the easiest way is to pick a Darkfriend for a Warder. But RAFO.

#### KEVIN BARTLETT

He either misinterpreted my question with that parenthetical comment, or intentionally avoided the point. I was thinking specifically of Vandene here, since it looks like she might have killed Adeleas and Ispan, and I have a hard time believing that she has been Black since before she ever bonded a Warder. She obviously
*has*
been Black for quite a while, since it was most likely her that warded the Draghkar who nearly killed Moiraine in
*The Great Hunt*
. But I have to think she most likely turned Black some time during her tenure as an Aes Sedai. So is Jaem a Darkfriend too? We must assume...

#### Footnote

It was revealed in
*Knife of Dreams*
that Adeleas was killed by Careane. Vandene was killed after killing Careane. Since Verin was sent after the boys, Liandrin seems the most likely candidate to have warded the Draghkar.
