# [Interview #91: TPOD Signing Report - Kevin Bartlett, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=91#2)

#### Kevin Bartlett

In
*The Dragon Reborn*
, when Rand encountered the lady merchant and her soldiers and slaughtered the whole bunch, did he have a good reason for doing so? Were they all really Darkfriends? Was that eleventh man really a Gray Man, or did Rand just count wrong?

#### Robert Jordan

He said that it's not supposed to be clear to the reader exactly what is going on. What
*is*
supposed to be clear is that there was definitely a Gray Man in the party. But whether or not Rand knew that before he lopped off their heads, we're
*not*
supposed to know. It's supposed to be unclear whether Rand is just very observant, or whether he's on the brink of madness.

#### Footnote

Clearly Rand didn't notice the Gray Man until after everyone was dead: "He had been sure there were only ten men, but eleven men knelt in that line, one of them without armor of any sort but with a dagger still gripped in his hand." Rand didn't even appear to notice that it was a Gray Man.
