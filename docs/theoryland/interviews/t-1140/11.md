#### Question

Something about whether Elantrians are immortal or long-lived (difficult to make out).

#### Brandon Sanderson

[verbatim] Elantrians have no physical limitations on their lifespan. The power will sustain them, but it's emotionally and mentally exhausting to be an elantrian, so as far as immortality goes it's actually harder to be an elantrian than other forms of immortality that exist in the cosmere"
