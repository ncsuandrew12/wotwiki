# [Interview #1117, Entry #1]: Files that did not make the Companion #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1117#1)

#### Team Jordan

Over the next month or two we plan on posting a few files from Robert Jordan's notes that, for one reason or another, will not be represented directly in the forthcoming
*The Wheel of Time Companion*
.

While some of these files won't be exciting to a lot of people [YMMV depending on personal interests], they offer good examples of the types of material RJ felt it was important to document. They have been edited in minor ways for consistency and ease of readingâ€”for example, most of the entries in this post had codes designating where each expression appeared in the books, a carry over from the days pre-digitalization.
