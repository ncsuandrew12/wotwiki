#### Jennifer Liang

Now, have they started talking about where signings are going to be taking place?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have. And there's a little bit of a wrinkle. This is starting to become public knowledge: Emily, my wife, is pregnant. (applause) Thank you. The unexpected baby is due the 22nd of January, and the book is coming out the 8th of January. So, we're gonna play it by ear; the bulk of the tour might be shifted until February. My goal right now is like, on the 8th, to go do like five or six signings, and then wait, and then do a bigger tour in February once the baby has come, and once we have mothers-in-law staying at the house or things like that. And so, probably...originally I was going to do the release party in Charleston, but Harriet said that since I’ve been doing them in Provo all this time, we have everything set up to handle all these people, and people camping out and things like that, and she said she would rather do that. So the release party will probably be there, and...

#### Jennifer Liang

You’re talking about the midnight release?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The midnight release party. The midnight release party will probably be in Provo and then we’ll do a handful more dates, one of which will probably be in Charleston, across the next five days, and then we’ll put everything else off until February. And I don’t know where those handful of dates are going to be yet; it seems likely that we would try to do, like, one in San Diego, probably, and then one in New York and then one in Charleston, you know, try and hit everything, and then maybe one in Chicago, so it’s like, each region we’re at least doing one, is the goal. But we will be in Charleston, which is kind of close to you guys. I think it’s important that we do a signing in Charleston for the last book.

#### Jennifer Liang

And Brandon will be at JordanCon in Atlanta...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I will be.

#### Jennifer Liang

...So if you want to come see him in April, you can.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I will be there. Definitely, that will be my first con after all of this, so...depending on the fan reaction...(laughter) I may be there...

#### Jennifer Liang

We may be there with some tar and some feathers...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I may be there in armor, but I will be there, one way or another. So, there you go.
