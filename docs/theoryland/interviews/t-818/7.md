# [Interview #818, Entry #7]: LibertyCon 2012 - AMOL Update Panel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=818#7)

#### Question

I was going to ask if Mat was going to finally go to Seanchan and take the throne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's the thing about spoiler questions. I'm only going to answer things that Robert Jordan has already said. And so, the only answer I can give you to that is, if you want that spoiler, go read
[what the outriggers](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=511#7)
[were going to be about](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=291#1)
. This is the sequel trilogy that Robert Jordan said he was going to write that we're actually not going to do, and that might give you some clue of what's going to happen in that plotline in
*A Memory of Light*
.

(silence)

Wow, this is the least question-filled room of you Wheel of Time fans I've ever experienced. Where's Emma when you need her?

#### Jennifer Liang

Sorry, I just lost my train of thought.

#### Joe O'Hara

We got one up front. Sir?

#### Question

I'm just wondering, where do you find the outrigger outlines or whatever?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Q&A database, which is now hosted....where? Where's Terez have that?

#### Jennifer Liang

I dunno, she keeps moving it around, so I can't keep it straight. She's gonna have a link somewhere on the Theoryland forums to that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you look for the Wheel of Time Q&A database, would be a great place, but I've done just googling....

#### Jennifer Liang

It's also in the Wheel of Time FAQ, if you can find
[wotfaq.dragonmount.com](http://wotfaq.dragonmount.com/node/175)
, and there's a question on there like, 'What other books was Robert Jordan planning?'...something like that, and that's where I wrote out about the outriggers and things like that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you just google 'Robert Jordan' and 'outriggers', I've found quotes by him, and that's what I've used to guide what I say about them, is just by doing that google search, because I know more about them, obviously, than he's said, and I try to keep to not saying very much about those just because they may be used for video games or things like that in the future, so I don't want to give spoilers to what someone's else's story might end up being.

#### Footnote

The interview database has always been on Theoryland, but it used to be hosted
[on the forums](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=372)
. Since the new database was created, that post has linked here. The two most important quotes about the content of the outriggers are
