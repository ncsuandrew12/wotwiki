# [Interview #818: LibertyCon 2012 - AMOL Update Panel, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=818#2)

#### Jennifer Liang

Down here at the end, this is Joe O'Hara. He is one of the co-hosts of twotcast, which is one of several Wheel of Time podcasts, and so he's actually recording this panel right now so it'll be online later.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, great! Oh, thanks for warning me about that!

#### Jennifer Liang

It's okay; this is gonna be the soberest twotcast ever; it'll be fun. Over here is Jeff Daniel; like I said before, he's one of the co-owners of Ta'veren Tees. And I'm Jennifer Liang; if you guys don't know me, I help run Dragonmount, I do the WoTFAQ now, I chair JordanCon, and I run the Wheel of Time track at DragonCon. I really don't have that much spare time; I don't know how I'm getting all this stuff done. So, this is our
*A Memory of Light*
panel...

#### Brandon Sanderson

The next-to-last one ever, I bet, because the last one would be at DragonCon, and then that's, like, it. For, after that, the books are all out.

#### Jennifer Liang

Pretty much, and then it's all like, "What did you
*do*
, Brandon?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Brandon, why did you kill..." I'm not gonna say.

#### Jennifer Liang

"You killed Cadsuane! What's wrong with you?"

#### Joe O'Hara

I would congratulate him for that one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Luckers would just murder me.

#### Jennifer Liang

Yeah. Yeah, he would.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He already is ready to murder me, because I don't treat Cadsuane with the respect that he thinks I need to treat Cadsuane, which...there may be legitimate gripes there; I don't know.

#### Jennifer Liang

Luckers is one of the admins over at Dragonmount, and he's got a few axes to grind.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep. Cadsuane's one of them. Every time I pop over to Dragonmount it seems like there's some thread about something, and I look in, and Luckers is complaining about Cadsuane. Every time. It's amazing; he's like your forum's Jerry Pournelle. Jerry's always on the SFWA forums and has an axe to grind. You know, he's always saying intelligent stuff, but it seems like he's
*always*
there saying his stuff. It's like, you click on a thread, and there's Jerry saying, you know, intelligent things—he's Jerry Pournelle; he's brilliant!—but he's
*always*
there, so...yeah. There's Jerry, and he does never not have an opinion. Yep. So...
