#### Question

How did Shallan rescue Kaladin when they fell in the chasm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She did not, it was actually Syl. But he was in the process of breaking the bond, and so she was able to get some stormlight to him, but that is what really â€” Like you can imagine, this bond was really a strain for her to use at that point, so it was her, but doing what she did just about destroyed her, which is why you don't hear from her after that.

#### Question

Is healing a universal stormlight power then?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, within reason. Some are better at it, but it is a universal power.

#### Question

With Dalinar, as a bondsmith, what does that mean his power-?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a good question! That is going to be an [RAFO card].
