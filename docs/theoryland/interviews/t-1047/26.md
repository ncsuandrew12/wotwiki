#### Question

Who or what is Hoid/Wit?

He is a person that has shown up in all of my epic fantasy books.

How does he have so much information about what's going on and how is he always in the right place at the right time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Those are very excellent questions. RAFO, but he has a surprising ability to be in the right place at the right time in the Cosmere.
