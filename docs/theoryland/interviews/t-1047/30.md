# [Interview #1047: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#30)

#### Question

Can you give me a hint in the easter egg in the map of Roshar? What particular skill do you need for it? Is it a different language or math related?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not linguistics. It is math related. Let me remind you this is not going to be a mind blowing revelation. It is going to be a nifty thing. Someone actually got close at one of my signings. They noticed something. But it is a fun easter egg that will tell you more about the history of the world.
