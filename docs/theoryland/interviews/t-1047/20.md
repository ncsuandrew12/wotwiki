# [Interview #1047: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#20)

#### Question

In the Stormlight Archive, there are a lot of Knight Radiant classes that are set at the end. Could you provide what abillities they have? Like Bondsmith?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Bondsmith I haven't really gotten into yet, though Bondsmith is next to Windrunners which means they will share one ability with Windrunners.

#### Footnote

The adhesion surge is shared.
