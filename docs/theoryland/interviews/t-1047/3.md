#### Question

Why does the shardbearer — when they're dueling with Adolin and Renarin — why does the shardbearer freak out when Kaladin grabs the sword — like, he screams, and shouts "I didn't kill you!" and ran away?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Why does he do that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because when Kaladin was there and they were touching it, they actually heard the spren that was inside of it.

#### Question

So it wasn't Syl that he heard, it was —

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was the sword's spren. That Kaladin was touching it — when a Knight Radiant touches it — you'll see when other Knights Radiant pick up sword, they can hear the screaming.
