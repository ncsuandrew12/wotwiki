# [Interview #1047: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#13)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyone else have questions or books that they need signed?

#### Question

I have a question. You gave me one of these little Szeth cards. I noticed on the back it looks like a game.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah it does, doesn’t it?

#### Question

What’s the story with that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Those—that was just like randomly printed there.

#### Herowannabe

[in a stage whisper] I don’t think he’s telling the truth.

#### Brandon Sanderson

We just got them back and we were like, "Wow, those random collection of letters look surprisingly like words from my books. How did that happen?"

#### Question

[inaudible ]… look forward to that?

#### Aradel

He’s not allowed to say.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s not a “Not allowed to say,” it’s that this is a fun little thing that may become something in the distant future.
