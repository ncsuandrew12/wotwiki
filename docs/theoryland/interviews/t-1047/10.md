# [Interview #1047: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#10)

#### Herowannabe

Okay, a couple questions about Kandra. So when Kandra digest bones, obviously they need that Physically, but is there a Cognitive or a Spiritual purpose to the bones, too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, the bones are just there for the muscles to pull against.

#### Herowannabe

Okay, so they don’t need it for some Spiritual link through the bones to mimic someone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Good question.

#### Herowannabe

Also, what would happen to a Kandra if you bisected it down the middle with half of its blessing ending up in either half?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would be—like ripping off any other piece of it—that would be very disturbing for the Kandra. But they could reabsorb and come back together. They would not be able to function half and half, that would eventually kill them basically. They can’t like send pieces of themselves off and do things. They can be ripped apart and heal, but if you ripped them in half, that would be killing them.
