# [Interview #1047, Entry #6]: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#6)

#### Herowannabe

When Sazed

#### Brandon Sanderson

You do know that I've got a character in one of the books named
*Bowen?*
[Clarification: My name is Bowen. He said this while personalizing our books]

#### Herowannabe

Really?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. He's actually been in the books so far, but not by name. He's one of the Worldhoppers. If you go look and talk to them they may have identified him, some people who have read.

#### Herowannabe

Thank you for naming a character after me!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I did it. He's from
*White Sand*
. I wrote the book in '98. Yeah, he's one of the Purelake guys.

#### Herowannabe

Is he Blunt?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah. [...] (later) So yeah, Bowen, you'll have to see because when I redid the linguistics for the world, his name I think got changed. I think it's now Baon. But in the very first draft of the very first book I ever wrote his name was Bowen. And the reason I think I changed it - is because he's a bowman. And I'm like I can't name the bowmanâ€”the archerâ€”Bowen. That's kinda dumb. But in my head he's still Bowen.

#### Herowannabe

Anyway, my question...
