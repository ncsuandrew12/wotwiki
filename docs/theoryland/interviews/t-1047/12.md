# [Interview #1047: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#12)

#### Herowannabe

I’m curious, I’ve got a list of various cosmere bits of metal, and I wonder if you would rank them from like 1 to 10 or easy to difficult on how hard it would be to steelpush on them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay.

#### Herowannabe

So, like metal inside a person’s body?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on how strong the investiture in them is.

#### Herowannabe

Is that going to be the answer for all of these?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably. :)

#### Herowannabe

How about a spike charged with Hemalurgy? Not in a person.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not in a person? It depends on how strong—yeah. A spike is moderately—in the realm of these sorts of things—moderately easy to push on, because a spike does not rip off very much investiture. Only enough to short circuit the soul, and it loses that over time. So I would put that at the bottom—with the top being very hard—to be one of the easier things.

#### Herowannabe

How about a metalmind? A feruchemy metalmind that is "full."

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is going to be middle of the realm. Generally easier than, for instance, a shardblade, which is going to be very hard.

#### Aaradel

But a shardblade isn’t actual metal. Ish?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ish. Is Lerasium a metal? Yeah.

#### Herowannabe

So would that be the same for Shardplate, too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Shardplate and blade are very hard. Blade is probably going to be harder. [...]

#### Herowannabe

Halfshard? Like a halfshard shield?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Halfshard shield is going to be in moderate.

#### Herowannabe

Nightblood? I imagine is going to be very difficult.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Very hard. Of all the things you’ve listed, he’s the hardest. Far beyond even a shardblade.

#### Herowannabe

Far beyond metal inside a person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, depending on how invested the person is.

#### Aaradel

If someone was invested as much as Nightblood I’m pretty sure it’s going to be very difficult.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, for instance, the Godking, at the end, with all of those Breaths. Pushing on something inside of him? Getting through all that? Gonna be REAL hard. Average person on Scadrial? You’ve seen how hard that is. A drab? Much easier.

#### Herowannabe

That was actually going to be my next one- No, sorry, not a drab, a Lifeless.

#### Brandon Sanderson

A Lifeless. Lifeless are kinda weird, because they’ve had their soul leave, but then they’ve had a replacement stuck in, in the form of Breath, which puts them in a really weird position compared to a Drab, which has had part of their investiture ripped away, but the majority of it remains. So anyway, I’m going to give you one more. Pick your favorite.

#### Herowannabe

Okay, a soul-stamped piece of metal.

#### Brandon Sanderson

A soul-stamped piece of metal is going to be on the lower, easier side. Not a lot of investiture going on in a soulstamp.
