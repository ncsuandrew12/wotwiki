#### Question

Are the rest of the books in the Stormlight Archive going to be different colors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are, and you can actually match the color to the order of the Knights Radiant. That's the Windrunners[WoK], that's the symbol of the Windrunners, that's the color. That's the Lightweavers[WoR], and that's the symbol of the Lightweavers, which is the same, and the color.
