# [Interview #1047, Entry #1]: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#1)

#### Herowannabe

I've gone through and transcribed the parts of the signing that I was directly involved in (the beginning and the end). I left out all the general gushing and picture-taking and Brandon giving instructions to the staff and etc. Any time I left out something more than 'um's or 'uh's I put "..." to show that I edited unimportant stuff out.

Oh, also, whenever I was aware of a 17thsharder talking (such as myself) I put their username in.
