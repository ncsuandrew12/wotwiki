#### Question

Is there any reason he didn't go by "Vasher"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because in the original draft he was, and I'm like, "That's just too easy." Plus he's kinda trying to hide. He's not as foolhardy as a certain other character who goes willy nilly by the same aliases over and over again and doesn't care. Picking a new alias, if you know people will potentially be looking for you, having them not be able to ask for you by name is useful.
