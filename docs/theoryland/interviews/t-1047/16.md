# [Interview #1047: WOR Signing Report - Herowannabe, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1047#16)

#### Question

I was just curious about Shardplate. In one of the books you said it was seamless like there weren't any chinks in it anywhere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are chinks but there is no direct line to the skin. So like if you see a slit, there's another little plate behind it.
