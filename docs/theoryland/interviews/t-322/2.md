# [Interview #322: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Warbreaker 4.0 DONE!, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=322#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

That doesn't mean I won't write book two. It just means that I'm thinking of starting a much larger story, then slipping in the WARBREAKER sequel sometime later.

Anyway, WARBREAKER 4.0 will go up early next week. It is my goal to post the downloadable version, then actually do an html chapter-by-chapter version for ease of reading. Would anyone (who hasn't read Warbreaker yet) be interested in this? Sound off on my LJ, my Facebook, or my forums.

You can also let me know what you think I should do next. You probably won't change my mind (it's not a vote) but I'd be curious to see what readers are wanting.

Warbreaker sequel
  
Elantris sequel (Different characters, same world.)
  
Big Epic (five or six books on a new project)
  
Random Stand Alone
  
Dragonsteel (Which is written, but now I don't know when to release it.)
  
More books in the Mistborn world

(Note: Again, I wouldn't do any more with the same characters. Their story is done after book three, as I promised it would be.)
