# [Interview #176: COT Signing Report - Réal Heppelle, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=176#4)

#### Réal Heppelle

I asked him why Egwene would want to change an iron chain into
*cuendillar*
(making sure that I pronounced it correctly CWAINDEEYAR :) I thought he would send me packing if I made a pronounciation mistake). I understood that the chain prevented enemy boats from entering Tar Valon, but I wasn't sure why she would want to make it indestructible.

#### Robert Jordan

He responded that iron doesn't TURN into
*cuendillar*
, iron is the base of
*cuendillar*
. He said that the links of the chain fuse together and become a solid piece. Thus making the chain impossible to raise, lower, or remove. This prevents boats from entering AND leaving Tar Valon. It then became obvious that this was a way for Egwene to successfully siege the island without using the One Power on anyone (as Lord Gareth wanted). I don't know why I didn't realize this on my own, but thought others might want the additional insight.
