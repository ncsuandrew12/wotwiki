# [Interview #207: Robert Jordan's Blog: THIS AND THAT, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=207#1)

#### Robert Jordan

For Marigan at Wotmania, and anyone else who might be wondering, not only do I not have cancer at present, I have never had cancer. Never. That was one of those rumors that float around without a shred of truth to them, thank God. I understand that I have been dead or near dead several times according to the rumors. I was run down by a bus once, so I recall hearing. Not true.
