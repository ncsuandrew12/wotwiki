#### Question

Question of the day went to the guy who asked Sanderson if he could be a soup, what kind of soup he would be!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson confirmed he would be a potato chowder but without the clams! Sanderson said he now had an answer to the question that asked him what was the strangest question he had ever been asked! It was definitely a curveball of a question, and got everyone laughing!
