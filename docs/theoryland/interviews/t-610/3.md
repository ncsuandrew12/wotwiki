# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#3)

#### Thomas C.

Arriving at the store about half an hour before the schedule 1pm start, my girlfriend (a member of the forums that goes by the username North Star) and I were taken backstage to meet the team involved with the book signing. There we saw Brandon Sanderson updating his Twitter status to say that he was finally in the UK! My girlfriend was cheeky and got one of her copies of the
*Mistborn*
books signed, as well as one for a friend.

It was at this point that we got an understanding of the plan for the day. Brandon Sanderson wanted to start the book signing with a reading that seemed to have caught the store’s staff off guard as they hadn't planned for it! What was meant to be a reading of about five minutes was nearer to ten, but I am sure the fans wouldn't complain, even if they had to stand! And I think the store were surprised at the number of fans who turned up—at the start, it was probably around the 75 mark, and was definitely a lot more by the end of the book signing.
