# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#6)

#### Question

The second question focused on the release date of
*A Memory of Light*
, the final book in the series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson answered that it would be in 2012, probably between March and November, but more likely to be towards the end of the year. The reason for this is because Harriet had requested more time to edit the book as she felt the previous books were rushed, hence the typos. During the book signing stage, Sanderson also revealed that his re-read of the Wheel of Time was another reason.
