# [Interview #610, Entry #17]: London Signing Report - Thomas C](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#17)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson talked about his plans while in London. His wife was currently in London trying to find tickets for a show tonight and early next week. He had asked his fans via Twitter what he should see. On the Sunday, he planned to visit some of London's free museums. I also got the impression he was off to Guildford for another book signing down there, and a few fans admitted they would see him again! To which Sanderson said he would find a new passage to read!
