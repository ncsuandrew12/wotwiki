# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#27)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson admitted he was one of four people who knew the ending that Jordan had written for the Wheel of Time. And I think I can put money on who the other three are...

#### Footnote

One would assume that this would include Harriet, Maria, and Alan, but we have been told that RJ's cousin Wilson also knows the ending.
