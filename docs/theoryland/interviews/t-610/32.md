# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#32)

#### Thomas C.

At the end of the signing, the staff from Forbidden Planet felt it had been one of their more successful book signings. Personally, I agree with that. I put that down to the fact that this was Sanderson's first time in the UK, and I don’t there had ever been a Wheel of Time related event like this here either. I do hope those involved in the Wheel of Time series and Sanderson’s team take note of this—there is a huge fan base over here in Europe just waiting for you! The
*Towers of Midnight*
tour was a huge success in North America—there is no reason why something similar for
*A Memory of Light*
wouldn't work in Europe!

And finally, I would like to thank Jennifer for giving myself and my girlfriend the chance to attend and for our special access. And I would also like to thank all the fans that took the time to come to the signing—without you, it wouldn't have been a success!
