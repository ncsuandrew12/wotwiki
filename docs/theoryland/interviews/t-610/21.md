# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#21)

#### Question

Several fans wanted to know how Sanderson felt about picking up the baton and continuing the Wheel of Time series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He felt daunted to begin with, mainly over the fear of not doing a good enough job. He knows it isn't perfect (like how Jordan would have written it), but he has loved the challengeâ€”and I am sure us fans do like what he has done. He was initially surprised at the hardcore nature of Wheel of Time fans. He jokingly viewed himself as a stepfather to the fans! I got the impression that Sanderson was blown away by the level of detail and research Jordan undertook for the mythologies etc behind the books. He said there were shelves and shelves of textbooks on the mythology, and Harriet was able to pick the necessary books should he need to do some background or further reading.
