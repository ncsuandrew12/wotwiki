#### Brandon Sanderson

A few questions covered the Wheel of Time being turned into a movie. Universal have the rights to the turn the first book,
*The Eye of the World*
, into a film. One fan asked if Sanderson would like a cameo role in the film. Sanderson said he would love a role, even if he was getting eaten by a Trolloc. I hope Universal takes note of this!
