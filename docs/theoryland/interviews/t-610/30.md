# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#30)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson admitted that there were landscapes/settings that he moved around his universes until he was sure that they fitted properly.

#### Thomas C.

There were definitely a lot of questions relating to detailed parts of Sanderson's non-Wheel of Time work. While I did make notes, my lack of knowledge of these works would mean I would probably make mistakes. So apologies for not covering that in greater detail.
