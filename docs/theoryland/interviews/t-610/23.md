#### Thomas C.

One fan happened to have the same t-shirt on as Sanderson. It was a grey t-shirt, with
*dovie'andi se tovya sagain*
("it's time to toss the dice") and a red hand on it. As Social Group Leader of the Band of the Red Hand, I felt extremely jealous. I think I am now on the lookout for one! [Dragonmount Editor's note: Those shirts are for sale from
[Ta'veren Tees](https://taverentees.com/threads/)
, an officially licensed t-shirt production company.]
