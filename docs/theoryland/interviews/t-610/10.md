# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#10)

#### Question

The sixth question was a good one. The questioner wanted to know Sanderson's view on working to deadlines and meeting publisher's demands. Basically, the question looked at quality versus timing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson made it clear that he never compromised on the writing. If there were to be any shortcuts, it was more likely to be in the proofreading stage.
