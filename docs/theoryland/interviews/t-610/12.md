# [Interview #610: London Signing Report - Thomas C, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=610#12)

#### Question

The twelfth and final question returned to the Wheel of Time and wanted to know if there were any plans for prequels and outriggers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

From the point of view as a fan, Sanderson said "yes", he would love there to be something like this. But from the point of view of the person in charge of Robert Jordan's legacy, it was a "no". It felt as if they would be capitalising on Jordan's name. When the question was raised during the book signing, Sanderson rated it at about a 5% chance of happening. So probably very unlikely one then.

#### Thomas C.

From my own view, I think this is fair. The series needs to be completed before anything like this is considered—and this is an opinion that Sanderson expressed as well. But don't rule it out—just look at Terry Goodkind. I am pretty certain Goodkind said he wouldn't write in his Sword of Truth world once
*Confessor*
was finished. But a new book,
*The Omen Machine*
, is coming out shortly and is set in the world of Richard Rahl and Kahlan Amnell. Only time will tell...
