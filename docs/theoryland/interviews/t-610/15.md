#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson has sold the film rights for the
*Mistborn*
trilogy. I believe this is common knowledge. What I believe is not common knowledge is that Sanderson has read the screenplay and is extremely pleased with it. All that is needed is a studio... Also, the series should appear as three films.
