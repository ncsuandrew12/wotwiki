#### Brandon Sanderson

After the sad and untimely death in 2006 of David Gemmell, a bestselling British fantasy author, a series of awards were set up in his name as a legacy in 2008—the
[David Gemell Legend Awards](http://gemmellaward.com/)
. The top award for this is the Legend Award for the Best Fantasy novel. Brandon Sanderson is nominated in this award category twice—once for
*The Way of Kings*
, and secondly for
*Towers of Midnight*
with Robert Jordan. The announcement of the winner is on 17th June 2011, and Brandon was disappointed not be in Europe at the time of the award. But I am sure we all wish him the best of luck in the category!
