# [Interview #788: JordanCon 2010 - Linda Taglieri, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=788#1)

#### Linda

Will Perrin undergo major new character development in
*Towers of Midnight*
as did, say, Fortuona and Rand in
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said he wouldn't answer specifically; I said I only wanted a general indication and he said that at the end of his scene in
*The Gathering Storm*
Perrin was about ready for character development. So I took that as a yes.
