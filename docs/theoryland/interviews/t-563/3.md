He spoke a bit about writing methods, and mentioned one: "In late, out early."

He mentioned that he doesn't like editing.

He wrote a few practice books, and a lot of back story for
*The Way of Kings*
, about 200k words.

He wanted to do a short series first alone with some stand-alone novels before writing an epic series.

He usually writes from 12AM to 4AM.

He learned about being chosen to finish WOT from a voicemail from Harriet, who picked him after reading
*Mistborn*
. Finishing
*A Memory of Light*
is now his focus.
