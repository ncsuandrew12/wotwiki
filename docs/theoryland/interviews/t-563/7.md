# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon stated he is not trying to imitate Robert Jordan's voice, but rather adapt his own voice to the Wheel of Time to write descriptions, "untrustworthy" character viewpoints, etc., to feel right for WOT. Tor did not want a ghost writer/imitator to write the last book (at the time it was still one volume). He wants to release a companion volume showing what RJ wrote and what Brandon wrote or changed.

He mentioned that RJ wrote the ending first, then the prologue, then middle parts of
*A Memory of Light*
