# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#9)

#### Question

How much pre-writing do you do for each book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wrote 50k words backstory for Mistborn, and 200k words backstory for
*The Way of Kings*
. It takes about 8 months to write a novel. Though it only took a month to write
*Alcatraz*
, which was a parody of conspiracies, and included bad super-powers, an anti-epic fantasy (and that a possible movie from Dreamworks was in the works at the time).
