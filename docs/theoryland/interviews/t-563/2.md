# [Interview #563, Entry #2]: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#2)

#### Ted Herman

This was Brandon Sanderson's first book signing in NYC.

He did a reading from
*Hero of Ages*
, from Tensoon's POV, and commented that it was a short chapter with a quickly resolved conflict. He then annotated the copy that he read from.

He did another reading from his PDA, which he called a "screen test" and it turned out to be a portion of Szeth's first scene in
*The Way of Kings*
.
