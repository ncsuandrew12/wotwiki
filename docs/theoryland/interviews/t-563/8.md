# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#8)

#### Question

Did the ending of WOT bum you out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it didn't, but it helped since that is how Brandon generally writes, which is to write the ending and use an outline. However, Brandon doesn't get to read
*A Memory of Light*
like a regular fan, which was a little disappointing since he is writing it (counter-balanced by the fact that he knows the ending before anyone else).

He did say that when he first went to Charleston that before eating dinner, he insisted on finding out who killed Asmodean, and how WOT ended!
