# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#13)

#### Question

How do you find an agent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One way is to go to awards ceremonies or writing conventions, such as WorldCon. Brandon stated he met his agent while he was attending the Nebula Awards in NY. He was at a bar, drinking sprite, and talked to someone nearby who happened to be Jim Mintz, an editor at Tor, and also met his agent, Moshe Feder (who was at the signing as well).
