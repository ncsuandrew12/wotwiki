# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#12)

#### Ted Herman

When he signed my
*Mistborn*
books, and
*Elantris*
, I told him where my Theoryland name originated, and asked him if he ever visited Theoryland.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He has lurked at Theoryland for the theories, but never posted there.
