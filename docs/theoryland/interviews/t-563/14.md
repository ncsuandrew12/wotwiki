# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#14)

#### Question

Will there be prequels or books about the Age of Legends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon stated he didn't want WOT to be like Star Wars with books telling scattered stories, but would like to do the prequels that RJ planned about Tam and Moiraine, and possibly the outriggers about Mat and Tuon as well (but not the other planned series, Infinity of Heaven).

He did mention the forthcoming WOT encyclopedia, and how extensive RJ's notes wereâ€”when he asked for a file on Perrin, he got notes that included 50 people from the Two Rivers who never even appeared in the books.
