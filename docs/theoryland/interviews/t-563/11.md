# [Interview #563: Hero of Ages Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=563#11)

#### Ted Herman

Are there release dates for the two
*Memory of Light*
volumes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No dates available yet, but
*A Memory of Light*
won't fit in one volume due to the binding not being able to hold the anticipated 800k words.
