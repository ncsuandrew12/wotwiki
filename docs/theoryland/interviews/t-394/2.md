# [Interview #394, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Award + Annotation](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=394#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also, the season for awards and awards nominations is upon us. I'll mention the Hugos in another post, but first I'd like to point out that I have been nominated for a new award known as the "David Gemmell Legend Award" which will be given in honor of Mr. Gemmell, who passed away in 2006. I'm honored, as I am a fan of Mr. Gemmell's work. (You may even have noticed that Kelsier's teacher, who is mentioned but never appears, was named after Mr. Gemmell.) This is a reader-voted award, so if you feel like voting for
*Mistborn: The Hero of Ages*
,

. You don't have to register in order to vote. Here is
