# [Interview #493: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Photoshop Contest - Win a New Tor Book, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=493#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

On an unrelated note, I've been very amused by that picture of Rand holding up an iPad that was over at
[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/30/macmillan-books-gone-from-amazon-com-steve-jobs-grins-wryly-fro/)
. Someone on my Facebook page made a great suggestion that Photoshopping the cover of
*The Dragon Reborn*
to have an iPad would be an awesome idea, what with the design of the book. That made me laugh out loud to consider.

Therefore, I'm issuing a Photoshop challenge (with prizes) to all of you readers out there. Photoshop a picture of a figure from the Wheel of Time books (it doesn't matter who, or whether you use official art or fan art) to include iPads, Kindles, Nooks, Sony Readers, or whatever ebook reader you prefer. Then send it to me or post it to my forums.

Be creative. Recreate the Last Battle with ebooks. Have Kindles being balefired. Whatever you want. Keep it clean, make us laugh, and have fun.

I'm going to give you until Friday at noon my time. My partners in crime (probably Peter and whomever I recruitâ€”maybe Maria and Dragonmount Jason) and I will pick our three favorites. If you win, I will walk to my local bookstore (okay, I'll probably give
[Mysterious Galaxy](http://www.mystgalaxy.com/)
or
[Sam Weller's](http://www.samwellers.com/)
a call) and I will BUY YOU A COPY of a recent Tor release. I'll also send you a signed hardcover of one of my books.
