# [Interview #908: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=908#3)

#### Matthew Peterson

Yep. Well, you do give a lot of advice, don't you? I mean you teach creative writing classes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do.

#### Matthew Peterson

Do you still do that? Even with all this on your plate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I still do it. But I only teach one class a year nowadays. So, it only lasts for about three months. But I feel a need to do that because it was in that class when I was an undergraduate, long ago, that I got the final bit of information I needed, it was the final kick in the pants, so to speak, to go get published.

#### Matthew Peterson

Oh.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was taught by David Farland at the time who was just doing what I'm doing. He was a professional writer. He was just stepping in to teach the class for a few years. And he gave me real world publishing advice, gave the whole class real world publishing advice. A lot of creative writing classes are very touchy feely. That's a good thing; they'll talk about the feel of writing and how to grow a story and all of this stuff. But Dave was the first one that came in and said, "Look, you can do this for a living. I'm going to tell you how and we're going to talk about the nuts and bolts of creating a story." And that was wildly useful to me. And so I feel a need to go back, when I have the opportunity and explain to new writers, those same sorts of things.

#### Matthew Peterson

Dave knows what heâ€™s talking about too. I mean, he did the Runelords.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep, Mm hmm. Which is also a
*New York Times*
bestselling success now.
