# [Interview #908: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=908#1)

#### Matthew Peterson

My next guest is Brandon Sanderson,
*New York Times*
bestselling author of the Mistborn and Alcatraz series. He was chosen to complete the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Times series, which has sold over 50 million copies worldwide and spawned computer, trading-card and role-playing games; soundtracks; comic books; and numerous fan sites. Looks like you've got some big shoes to fill.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Matthew Peterson

Thanks for being on the show today, Brandon.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks for having me.
