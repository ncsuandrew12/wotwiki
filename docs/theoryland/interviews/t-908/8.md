# [Interview #908, Entry #8]: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=908#8)

#### Matthew Peterson

Well, you've got so many things to tie up. And Robert Jordan, he knew that he was going to die. He knew that, and so he was writing as fast as he could. He got these notes. And you're working off of these notes, which is so great for the fan base, 'cause we get a feel for what Robert Jordan had in mind. I do have one question that everyone is asking me to ask you. [laughs] Are we going to find out who killed Asmodean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. He left notes about who killed Asmodean. To be included in the book. Harriet's decided where it goes. I can't tell you which of the three books it's going to appear in. But it is going to be in there and he did write the ending himself, of the entire thing.

#### Matthew Peterson

Oh, okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which is just wonderful. It makes this book possible because I know what the ending is. He left a lot of material through the middle too, as well. But he left that ending. He'd been promising us for years that he knew the ending of the series. And he did. And he wrote it down. And so I'm really working towards the goal of getting to that ending and working with it in mind and so, yeah, you don't need to worry that the ending wonâ€™t be Robert Jordan's ending, because he wrote that himself.

#### Matthew Peterson

That is great to know. I didn't know that. Well, that is awesome.
