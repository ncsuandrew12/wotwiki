[www.TheAuthorHour.com](http://www.TheAuthorHour.com)
for the bonus questions that didn't make it onto the live show. Next week I've got five popular authors who've written some of the most well-known, modern classics of our day: Anne Rice, Brian Herbert, Kevin J. Anderson, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Orson Scott Card. See ya next week!
