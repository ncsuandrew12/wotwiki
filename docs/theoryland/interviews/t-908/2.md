# [Interview #908: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=908#2)

#### Matthew Peterson

Now I did meet you a while back at a convention, I can't remember which one it was, maybe the World Science Fiction Convention and we were talking about the Wheel of Time and audiobooks and your podcasting.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh huh, okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But something interesting happened from that, and I just wanted to thank you, there's something that you did that you don't even know, you gave me some advice. At that time, I was in the middle of getting my rights back for my book, and I had an audiobook that was coming out. And you gave me some advice about how to get it onto Audible. [laughs] You probably don't even remember that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I hope it was good advice.

#### Matthew Peterson

It was good. It worked. [laughs]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, if it was good advice, then I take credit for it. If it was bad advice then it was my evil doppelganger.
