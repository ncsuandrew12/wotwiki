# [Interview #165: COT Signing Report - Daniel G, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=165#1)

#### Daniel G

I had a tape recorder there, but for some reason, the moment RJ started talking, it stopped recording :(. It doesn't really matter anyway, because we left it at the store. This is not word for word what happened, but it's pretty close.

#### COOP STAFF

Alright, Mr. Robert Jordan will be coming in a few moments, and he'll answer some questions for 20 minutes, and then...

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, I can introduce myself.

#### COOP STAFF

Ok, well then, put your hands together for Robert Jordan! (applause)

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Alright, I'm not going to be answering questions for any bloody 20 minutes. And of course, any question I don't answer here, I'm sure to answer at the signing. But first off, its Nynaeve. (Laughter) It's Egwene. Not Eegwene, not Egweenee. Egwene. (Laughter) Cyndane, Semirhage, Aiel, (etc.)
