#### Robert Jordan

Now, let me answer some of the most common questions. (I don't remember most of these, but...) How many more books will I have in the series? At least two. You see, at first I thought it would be a five, maybe six book series, and back then that was crazy, because you either had one book or a trilogy. Even (don't remember book name) was set up in two trilogies.
