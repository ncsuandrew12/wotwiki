# [Interview #165: COT Signing Report - Daniel G, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=165#8)

#### Daniel G

(when he signed my book): Who is you favorite character, if you have one?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, my favorite character is whoever I am writing about for the moment, but I will tell you which characters I relate to. When I was growing up, I tried to be like Lan. Physically, and partly behavior, I was like Perrin, and behavior wise, I was like Mat. If he had a Harley, I'm sure he would ride one too (chuckles). My wife thinks that I'm "Loial to the life", but I don't see were she gets that.

(I also heard him talk about speeding in Maine.)
