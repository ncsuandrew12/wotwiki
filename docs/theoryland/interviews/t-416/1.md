# [Interview #416, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Reader Mail (Regarding TGS Release Date)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=416#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm back! Thank you to everyone who came to see me in Nebraska. I had a great time. It was surreal to visit my old high school and elementary school as an author, presenting for the students. At East, I was given a distinguished alumnus award, which was very humbling. Pemberly should have pictures for me to post here soon, mostly just pictures of me doing nostalgic Nebraska things, like eating at Runza.

Anyway, I wanted to do a good post for you all today, so I thought I'd answer an interesting Reader Mail piece. I'm still working on a post talking about
*A Memory of Light*
: Book Two and
*The Way of Kings*
. I hope to have a draft of that I'm satisfied with here soon.
