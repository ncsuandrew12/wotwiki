## [Entry #1](./t-1174/1)

#### Question

I asked Brandon if it was any coincidence that Sadeas's name sounds suspiciously similar to the word sadist, and

#### Brandon Sanderson

in essence his answer was no, it's not a coincidence, but he didn't consciously choose the name for that specific reason. More like his brain decided it sounded good for that character because his subconscious heard the similarity.

## [Entry #2](./t-1174/2)

#### Question

Today at the dark talent release, I asked Brandon for the name of dalinar's wife.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dalinar's wife's name was eevee. (Spelling unknown)

## [Entry #3](./t-1174/3)

#### Question

(I mentioned I had a question about Paalm) So in Shadows of Self, when TenSoon and Was are fighting the spiked creature things, TenSoon mention that he was Harmony's "Preservation."

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Brandon seemed a bit apprehensive about that statement.)

#### Question

And he said that Wax was Harmony's "Ruin."

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Still aprehensive) Yes...

#### Question

Well since Harmony has been around for about 300 years someone else would have had to fill that role, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably...

#### Question

And could that person possibly have been Paalm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe...

## [Entry #4](./t-1174/4)

#### Question

Next I asked about the importance of a lot of the religion from the "Final Empire Era" Scadrial. I pointed out that there were a lot of little nods and references to other shardworlds.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And he assured me that there was something there, perhaps not anything as big as I was hoping for, but definitely more than just "Easter eggs!"

## [Entry #5](./t-1174/5)

#### Question

I asked whether spren, particularly those bonded to a Knights Radiant, could worldhop,

#### Brandon Sanderson

and he said that it would be very difficult for them to.

## [Entry #6](./t-1174/6)

#### Question

I asked about the cultural importance of Ais' gender-swap

#### Brandon Sanderson

he talked about how part of the reason for the change, was he felt that he had already covered the strong patriarchal society and the oppression of women some of his other works, such as Elantris and Stormlight.

## [Entry #7](./t-1174/7)

#### Question

Lastly, I asked for a random fact about Hoid.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was hesitant at first, and after a bit, and me begging for even something inconsequential, he responded: "In the next book people will think he is helping them, but he is really helping himself." And when I pushed by what he meant by "next book" he refused to answer.

## [Entry #8](./t-1174/8)

#### Question

Can you give me any information about Trell?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It read: "Trell has been many things over the eons..."

## [Entry #9](./t-1174/9)

#### Djarskublar

So I could be wrong, but a Hemalurgic spike, when you use it and become a savant it does damage to your Spiritweb, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes Hemalurgy always hurts you. (I think he was saying that the Hemalurgy itself hurts you more than being a savant, but I'm not sure how to interpret this)

#### Djarskublar

So say you go to Roshar and you give somebody a Hemalurgic spike for some Allomantic power, don't care what, and you use it to become a savant. Does that qualify them as 'broken' enough to become a Radiant? As long as they are also following the Ideals to attract a spren.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So becoming a Radiant is a spectrum of terminologies. It... probably, but you would have to find a Radiant who would, or a spren who would be willing to touch that, okay? It's going to drive them back.

#### Djarskublar

So would it also affect your probability of becoming an Elantrian?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah it would affect your ability to become anything else, yes.

#### Djarskublar

Okay, so would it be a positive effect, negative effect...? Because I was like, it gives you cracks in your Spiritweb.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does give you cracks in your Spiritweb.

#### Djarskublar

So it's easier for Investiture to get in. Does it make it easier for other Investitures to get in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would make it... yes. It's going to drive spren away. So what it's really going to make easier for, there, is spren and Investiture that doesn't care.

#### Djarskublar

Okay, so Investiture doesn't care but spren do.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Investiture might care depending on if it's part of a Shard-- if it has intent and things like this.

#### Djarskublar

So it might let Stormlight in easier than a Breath, type thing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm saying it might let Odium in easier than Syl. Because Syl would care, and Odium would not care.

#### Djarskublar

Okay cool.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, so it could be a really bad thing, is what I'm trying to say to you.

#### Djarskublar

Yeah that's cool. I just want to know more about gold too. Gold Allomancy too. Because Miles was doing some funky stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Miles was doing some funky stuff.

## [Entry #10](./t-1174/10)

#### Question

He asked if Kel had been born on Roshar, and something similar happened to him, would he be able to communicate with the living via Death Rattle.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My understanding (of what I remember of what he paraphrased... Not a solid source) is that Brandon said it would be similar to a Rattle, but not the same.
