# [Interview #952, Entry #4]: AMOL Signing Report - Rebecca Lovatt](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=952#4)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Aside from basking in Brandon’s considerable wit and wisdom, the fans who came out to the Lillian H. Smith branch of the Toronto Public Library last night just had a lot of fun. We Memory Keepers tried to keep the crowd happy with a trivia contest (using the same trivia as the Seattle signing), wherein a certain charming gambler claimed a downright impressive proportion of the raffle ticket rewards—as did his Aes Sedai companion in the purple shawl. (What does your ajah do? Must be a Fourth Age thing.) Word searches and trivia continued to help pass the time whilst waiting in line.

We also presided over a rip-roaring game of Wheel of Time-themed pictionary; some fans looked at our set-up askance at first, but once a few people took the plunge (including the aforementioned gambler and Aes Sedai), a hard core of dedicated players went on guessing for hours—with such clues as (mildly spoilerific, maybe) "Aviendha's feet," "Narg," "a knack" (no one wanted to tackle that one...), and "Illianer beard"—even after we had run out of prizes. This game is highly recommended at your next Call to a Sitting or Great Stump.

Overall, the mood of the event was just happy. Happy to have a complete story, happy to have an open and engaging author, happy to be part of such a friendly and awesome fandom—and happy to have rode of the wind's of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.

The Memory Keepers would like to extend their thanks to Dragonmount.com, Bakka-Phoenix Books, Brandon Sanderson and Lillian H. Smith Library for allowing us to take part in this wonderful event.
