Reporting in from blustery Toronto, Canada, where a great time was had by all.

We were down by one Memory Keeper, as Paul unfortunately had to cancel last minute. However, the six remaining onesâ€”Rebecca, our "First Among Equals", Karen, Lisa, Praan, Alex and Alex (just to be confusing, I'm sure) were overjoyed to be able to take part and to have this opportunity. Doors to the signing at the Lillian H. Smith Library (home to The Merril Collection) opened up just after 6:00, with a fairly sizeable group of fans already waiting in line. We started the evening off with games such as trivia, word searches and crosswords until Brandon arrived and took the floor.

Brandon was his usual personable self, answering questions about the experience of finishing the Wheel of Time, the story and its world themselves, and his writing habits and experiences with equal aplomb. He closed his remarks by reading the iconic opening to each book, our last opportunity to hear those words in a new permutation. The crowd, needless to say, was most appreciative.
