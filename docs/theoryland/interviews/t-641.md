Quick quick summary, I'll post a longer write up later.

## [Entry #2](./t-641/2)

#### Terez

Ask him if Rand's question about how to 'win and survive' the Last Battle counted as two questions.

Terez: the win and survive counted as ONE question, very direct answer there. :)

*a'dam*
placed upon Moghedien (a mistress of
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
) was so effective?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This got Brandon thinking hard but he RAFO'd it in the end but he did say 'are you a Theorylander?' which did make us laugh. :)
