# [Interview #936, Entry #3]: AMOL Signing Report - James](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=936#3)

#### James

After a decent Q&A and a short reading from Harriet (which Emilie has a video of), we started the signing. I'd estimate that there were about 400 people there, but that's a fairly conservative estimate, I think. Brandon didn't want personalizations done on the first go-through, just so Harriet would be able to get back to the hotel at a decent time.

I was in charge of grabbing people's phones and cameras and taking pictures of them with Brandon and Harriet, and Alice was in charge of flipping the books to the page where Harriet would sign. As such, we got to hear some great questions and some great answers. After a little while, we rotated out, because things were going pretty long, and I sat down and chatted with a couple of people for a little while, and things had definitely wound down by then. It was just people getting personalizations in line and asking super-geeky questions of Brandon.

After most people had left, the Memory Keepers and a couple of other fans that decided to stay, as well as Duane from the bookstore, all sat around and asked Brandon some questions. We got to know some really awesome stuff (again, which I think Alice will transcribe), and overall it was a great event.
