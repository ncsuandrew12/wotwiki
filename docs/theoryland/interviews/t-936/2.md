# [Interview #936: AMOL Signing Report - James, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=936#2)

#### James

At around 6:15pm, Brandon and Harriet showed up, and we led them to the back room where they would be signing some stock and answering our questions. A few of us got R.A.F.O. cards, which was great, and we got some answers to questions (which I think Alice will have transcribed from her recorder) that we'd been wanting to ask since
*A Memory of Light*
came out.

Brandon was great to hang out with, and Harriet was just a great southern lady, and on top of that a great person as well. We even got to hear the possible names for the second Stormlight Archive book, and then have Harriet suggest an all-new one, since she didn't like any of the suggestions, and it was great. After we took a group picture and everything, we led them out to the main area.
