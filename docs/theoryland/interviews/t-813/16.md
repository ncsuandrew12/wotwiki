# [Interview #813: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#16)

#### Casey Phillips

You've mentioned baseball a number of times, so what's your batting on screwing it up as little as possible, at this point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So far, it's pretty good. There are a few things I got wrong, particularly in
*The Gathering Storm*
that I feel I did much better in
*Towers of Midnight*
and hope to do even better in
*A Memory of Light*
.

Comparing it to batting averages, I would say I'm doing a decent job. What is that? A .28? [Laughs.] Percentage wise, I'm doing better than that—maybe 85 to 90 percent of the things I needed to be doing I've been able to hit.

There's still that 10 percent that fans have to be lenient with me on, to some extent, because no one is going to get it to 100. I can hope to push it higher than I have, but there are certain things I've done that I've done a worse job on than I would have liked. There were some characters I didn’t quite get right in the first book.
