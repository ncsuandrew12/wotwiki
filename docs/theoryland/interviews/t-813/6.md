# [Interview #813, Entry #6]: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#6)

#### Casey Phillips

Do you think there is a "Brandon Sanderson's Guide to Fantasy Literature" in your future?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Umm...maybe. Honestly, if I were to do that, it would be a long way off. I still think there's a lot I need to learn about this whole process before I can put it down in words. There many people who have done a great job at that in the past. Stephen King's book is great. Orson Scott Card's
*How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy*
is great. There are a lot of wonderful resources out there already, and it's one thing for me to get up and talk about my process, but I feel like it's different to write a "this is how you do it" book. I'd like to have a decade or two under my belt before I do that.
