# [Interview #813: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#21)

#### Casey Phillips

Your Mistborn series has been well-received. Will you continue exploring that universe in more novels or are you more interested in writing about new worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will come back to Mistborn. The original trilogy is done and complete. I did write a sequel to that that takes place hundreds of years later. I may do more with the characters in the sequel,
*The Alloy of Law*
, but my intention is to keep revisiting that world time and time again. When I first pitched it to my editor, I pitched it as a much longer series spread across the years with different glimpses of what's going on in the world.
