# [Interview #813, Entry #17]: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#17)

#### Casey Phillips

How definitive was Robert Jordan's outline for the final Wheel of Time novels? Was there any room left for you to find your own path?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There was a lot of room, and it's been a true collaboration. Wherever he left information, I tried to follow what he directed, but there were huge gaps that he didn't explain, and I got to do what I thought the story needed at those points.

#### Casey Phillips

So it was more a series of landmarks to hit than a point-by-point road map.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, certainly. That's a really good way to explain it. He wrote the last scene himself, for instance, and big chunks of the prologue and, interspersed through that, viewpoints from different characters. There were notes that his assistants gathered for me when during his last months they asked him a lot of questions.
