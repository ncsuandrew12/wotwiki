# [Interview #813, Entry #13]: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#13)

#### Casey Phillips

Under what circumstances did you met Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I never met him. I saw him once at a convention, and that was it. I was chosen, unbeknownst to me, by his wife Harriet when she was looking for someone. Mistborn ended up in her hand, she read it, and she called me. I didn't know what was happening, but she asked me if I was interested [in writing the last novel].
