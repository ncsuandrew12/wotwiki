# [Interview #813: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#15)

#### Casey Phillips

What sense of responsibility did you feel when Jordan's widow approached you to take over The Wheel of Time with 10 novels have so firmly established the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was just hoping I wouldn't screw it up. I've said this a number of times that anyone approaching it was going to screw it up, to an extent. This is Robert Jordan's work, not mine, and there's no way I can do the job he would have done. My goal is just to screw it up the least of anyone who would have been given this job. I wanted the characters to remain themselves. I felt like if I could do that, everything else would fall in line.
