# [Interview #813: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#12)

#### Casey Phillips

Is there an appetite, either on your behalf or that of your readers, to write an
*Elantris*
sequel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There certainly is, based on the questions people ask me. Basically, at every signing, someone asks me that. You know, we'll have to see what happens. I plan and hope to do one, but The Wheel of Time has really drawn a lot of my attention and my efforts lately. So once The Wheel of Time is done, I can reassess and figure out what my five-year plan is for novels.
