#### Casey Phillips

What was your reaction to reading Jordan's notes for the series' conclusion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was very satisfied. I was very satisfied with the ending.

#### Casey Phillips

How would you characterize the ending?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really don't want to give any spoilers, and I'm worried that anything I say here the Wheel of Time fans will read to much into. I would characterize it as the right ending for the series, and that's basically all I can say.
