# [Interview #813: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#19)

#### Casey Phillips

What was the impetus for splitting the last novel into three novels?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was writing it to the length he instructed it was to be written. He wanted it to be so long, he said, that “it would take a wheelbarrow to get it out the doors.” The publisher and Harriet decided that was too long. I was supposed to split it into three novels because of the length I was writing it at. It came down to binding issues and things like that.
