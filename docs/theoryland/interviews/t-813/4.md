# [Interview #813, Entry #4]: Chattanooga Times Free Press Q&A with fantasy author Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=813#4)

#### Casey Phillips

You teach creative writing at Brigham Young University, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I got my master's degree there in English with a creative writing emphasis. While I was doing it, the teacher who was teaching the genre fiction-focused creative writing course wanted to retire. They came to me—I had a book deal at that point—and asked me if I wanted to take over the class. I've taught it these 10 years or so. It's the only class I teach. I wouldn't call myself a real professor, but I do have this one class I get to play with and have fun teaching as an adjunct every year.
