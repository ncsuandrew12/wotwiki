# [Interview #596: Verin Q&A with Maria Simons, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=596#23)

#### Matt Hatch

I think Maria enjoyed that way too much, but I couldn't stop chuckling when I went through the list. Although I would suggest that it seems clear that Verin's touch on this world has not ended and we may yet get many of these answers in
*A Memory of Light*
. If not, then the encyclopedia we can hope, at least those Verin freaks among us.
