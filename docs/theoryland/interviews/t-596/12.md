# [Interview #596: Verin Q&A with Maria Simons, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=596#12)

#### Question

Verin makes many statements throughout the books that are suspect now that we know she was not bound by the Oaths. In regards to the
*ter'angreal*
dream ring, Verin tells Egwene, "I tried it myself, once, some years ago. Anaiya's Healing did not work as well as it should have. Remember that."

During the time Verin gave Egwene the ring she mentioned going to Anaiya to be healed. She didn't go to a Yellow for Healingâ€”does Verin hold something over Anaiya? Were they pillow friends? Or was this simply a case of asking a friend to do a minor healing because she knew she would keep it quiet?
