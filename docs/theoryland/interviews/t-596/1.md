# [Interview #596: Verin Q&A with Maria Simons, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=596#1)

Some Background

Back in July of 2010 with the prospect of getting an opportunity to interview Brandon, I was chatting with Linda of
[13th Depository](http://13depository.blogspot.com/)
about Verin, a favorite topic. I mentioned that Brandon, during
*The Gathering Storm*
tour, seemed disappointed that fans were not asking more Verin related questions. And I had done a podcast on Verin with 4th Age which reminded me just how much we didn't know about Verin. So, after spending some time brainstorming question topics with Linda, I grabbed a few more HCFF's (Terez and Marie) to knock out a detailed list of questions. And what you will read below is the list of Verin related questions we developed hoping that Team Jordan/Team Sanderson would be more open to the idea of discussing Verin now that she had died. I'm a bit of a Verin freak, so this shouldn't surprise anyone.

About the List
  

After posing a few of these questions which were much more elaborate in their setup believing I would be interviewing someone when asking them, Brandon recommended that I send him the list and he'd send it on. It's been quite busy since then for Team Jordan, but Maria gratefully walked through the List recently and sent us back the following.

So...enjoy. Linda posted in tandem with us on this and spoke a little bit about the reasoning for some of the questions she cared most about. You can find her post here:
