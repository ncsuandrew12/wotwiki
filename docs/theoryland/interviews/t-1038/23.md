#### Question

What command would you have to give to an Awakened object like Nightblood in order for it to not go insane?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am going to RAFO that about Nightblood, but is Nightblood insane? It just has no concept of... It was commanded to do something it was not equipped to judge. I would not call Nightblood insane. I would say that you have commanded something with no concept of morality to make moral decisions, and that's very confusing to him.
