# [Interview #1038: Steelheart Signing Report - Argent, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1038#15)

#### Question

Is there any other canonical way to refer to a set of Shardplate and a Shardblade other than Shards, so as to not confuse them with the Shards of Adonalsium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They call them just Shard(s). It is a little confusing, because there are other Shards, but they don't know about them. I call them a set, but there is no canonical way to refer to them.
