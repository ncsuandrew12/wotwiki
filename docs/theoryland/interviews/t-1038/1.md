# [Interview #1038: Steelheart Signing Report - Argent, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1038#1)

#### Question

Pat Rothfuss recently worked with the folks from Albino Dragon to create a Kickstarted
*Name of the Wind*
deck of cards in which each face card features a character from the book. All those designs were discussed with Pat, and the final result is shaping up to be pretty spectacular. Are there plans—or if not, are you open to planning—to do something like this for one or more of your own worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know about Pat's deck, it's really awesome stuff! I can only say that I do have plans to do something similar, but you will have to wait for Words of Radiance to find out more about it.

#### Footnote

The Kickstarter took place in late spring of 2013.
