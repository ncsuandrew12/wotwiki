#### Question

If Ati had somehow managed to give up Ruin and returned to being a regular person, would his mind have gradually reverted from its corruption by Ruin's intent, or would he always be determined to destroy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Over time Ruin's influence would fade, but Ati would remain a Sliver, so there would be some permanent effects.
