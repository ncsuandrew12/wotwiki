# [Interview #1038: Steelheart Signing Report - Argent, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1038#19)

#### Question

Did David get Steelheart's weakness absolutely correct, or was it just close enough to allow him to destroy Steelheart?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was absolutely correct. This is something David and Reckoners will actually discuss in
*Firefight*
. The second book will reveal much more about the Epics' weaknesses, and you will find out that there is actually a pattern to them, even though everyone thinks it's random.

#### Question

Are weaknesses somehow related to things, events, or phenomena the Epics feared, or hated, or disliked before they turned Epic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, second book. This is the exact question people—and David—are asking in the second book. Good question though.
