# [Interview #1038: Steelheart Signing Report - Argent, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1038#4)

#### Question

Was Calamity and its appearance in
*Steelheart*
just kind of an ad hoc? We know that it showed up about a year before the Epics started showing up, so people naturally assume one was the cause and one was the effect, but was that really the case and are both of them just the effects of something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question! I will say that this is something I've done before, so my fans will kind of expect it. I am aware of this expectation too, and I am careful about repeating myself.
