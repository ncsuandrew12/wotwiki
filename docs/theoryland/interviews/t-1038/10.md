#### Question

Do the Spiritual and Physical Realms have names, like Shadesmar is the Cognitive Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kind of, but not really. Shadesmar is just a rough translation of "Cognitive Realm" in the language of whoever first found out about it. Other people, planets, and worlds wouldn't call it Shadesmar, they would call it whatever their words for "Cognitive Realm" are. This applies to the Physical and Spiritual as well.
