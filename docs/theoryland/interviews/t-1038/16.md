# [Interview #1038: Steelheart Signing Report - Argent, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1038#16)

#### Question

Is Cultivation's Shardholder still alive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question, what do you think?

#### Question

I want to say, but that's based on my knowledge before I read Lift's interlude from
*Words of Radiance*
. Now I am leaning towards no. Based on that interlude, it looks like spren have essence from both Honor and Cultivation. It's almost like they exist in a spectrum, on one end of which is Honor, and on the other - Cultivation; so there are spren that are, for the lack of better example, 90% Honor and 10% Cultivation, and there are spren that are 15% Honor and 85% Cultivation.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a very astute observation!

#### Question

And since we know that Honor is Splintered, then it might be the case that Cultivation is also Splintered, and their Splinters form the spren.

#### Footnote

In a prior signing report it was revealed that Cultivation's shardholder is indeed alive.
