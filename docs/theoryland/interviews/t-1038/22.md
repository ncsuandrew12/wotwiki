#### Question

Will Llarimar become Susebron's high priest?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would not be surprised of the events too him there.

#### Question

Do you think he would be unhappy with the position?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Susebron is going to make at least, if not a good God King, then at least an earnest one, and Llarimar would approve of that.
