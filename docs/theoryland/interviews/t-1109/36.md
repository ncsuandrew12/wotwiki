# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#36)

#### Question

In
*The Rithmatist*
, you mention that Joel actually sneaks into the classroom, is that a spin-off of what you did?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually had a teacher once ask, "Who are you?" One of them actually picked me out. Fortunately, that was one that my roommate was going to, so I was able to [pretend I was just there with him].

#### Footnote

The last part is paraphrased due to "what he said involved too many gestures and non-word sounds".
