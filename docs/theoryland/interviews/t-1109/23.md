# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#23)

#### Question

In the Mistborn trilogy, was it hard to write the final twist, or had it been planned that way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is always the way it was planned. There are some smaller things that I'll allow spontaneity to change the book, but the general structure of the book is always planned out. And if something changes while I'm writing I go and throw away the plan and rebuild the plan, so I'm always writing with a plan.
