# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#37)

#### Question

How do you keep it all organized when you're doing so much at once?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A wiki. An internal wiki is where I keep all the cosmere and all the notes on that. The other things, I don't have to worry about as much. For instance, Reckoners, I've got one viewpoint character and one major plot; that I can keep in my head. I've got note files and things like that, but the cosmere? Big old wiki full of stuff.
