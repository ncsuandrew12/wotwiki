# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#16)

#### Question

I was wondering if you were thinking along the lines of a movie of Alcatraz?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We tried really hard. We actually even got storyboards and things with Dreamworks Animation, which was going to be awesome, but then they eventually let it die. So if you buy the big art Dreamworks Animation book, there's actually Alcatraz concept art on one of the pages, which is kind of excruciating that it never happened.
