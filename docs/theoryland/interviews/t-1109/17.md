#### Question

Why couldn't Joel be a Rithmatist? He wanted it so bad.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will explain as the series progresses. That is a plot point. Every book like that, they get the power in the end, and I thought it was a much more interesting story if he has half—the knowledge—and Melody has half—the talent—and together they create a whole. It just worked, and it was much better for me as a story. I knew going into it that he wasn't going to be able to by the end of the book, but the reasons for it you'll find out as the series progresses.
