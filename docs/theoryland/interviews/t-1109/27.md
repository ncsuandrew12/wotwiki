#### Question

Infinity Blade, are there other plans to continue with that, and are they going to release a print edition?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What the plan is right now, if I can convince them to do it, is to do a nice print edition that will include the script of the first one, annotated by the guys who wrote it, my story in between, then the script for the second, then my story, then the script of the third, so it's a complete story, with the cut scenes illustrated, and things like that. So even a graphic novel, then prose, then a graphic novelâ€”something like that.
