#### Question

There was the poem at the end of Way of Kings. How long did that take?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It took an embarrassingly long amount of time. I am not a poet, so mixing poetry with a really rigid form... Yes, the keteks take a long time. Both of them.

#### Wetlander

Are you going to do that in every book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A ketek? Yes, I probably will do that.
