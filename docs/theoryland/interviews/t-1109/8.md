#### Wetlander

Have you actually written out the Diagram, and
*Words of Radiance*
, and so on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, heavens, no. That's the sort of thing that falls into the worldbuilders' disease thing; there's no way that writing those out is worth the effort, so no, I have not. Definitely not the Diagram. If I were going to write any of them, I would write
*The Way of Kings*
, but even that, it's probably 30 or 40 thousand words in-world.
