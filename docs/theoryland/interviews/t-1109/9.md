#### Wetlander

How much time elapses between the beginning of the main part of the story (where they start out at the Shattered Plains) and the end of the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

And the end of the series? Because the end of the series, um, we have a 15-year gap between [books] 5 and 6. So, the first five will probably be Wheel-of-Time-ish, sort of, each one picks up where the last one left off; we have a little more time, maybe, than Wheel of Time, but not terribly much, so it will probably be just a couple of years for the first ones, but then we will jump.
