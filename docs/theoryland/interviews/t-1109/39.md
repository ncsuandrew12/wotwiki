# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#39)

#### Question

When are you going to write the other
*Warbreaker*
book? Last time I came to hear you talk, you said you were going to, and now you have 3000 other projects!

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know, and the
*Warbreaker*
fans really get on my case about that. Well, I wrote
*Words of Radiance*
, and I got Vasher into it, so that would kindle interest, and make sure that you at least got to see your characters again. But did you hear the story about that? So, I wrote
*The Way of Kings*
in 2002, the first version, and in that version Kaladin trained with a swordmaster, and that swordmaster, a guy named Vasher, had a mysterious past. After I finished that book, later on I wrote
*Warbreaker*
as a prequel to
*The Way of Kings*
, to show Vasher's backstory. But then
*Warbreaker*
came out before
*The Way of Kings*
, which was a really kind of interesting thing. So in my head,
*Warbreaker*
is the prequel, but to everyone else...

Yes, it is a totally different world, different planets, people get around...

#### Wetlander

So how much of Vasher's backstory do we actually have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, a huge chunk of it! If you were reading
*The Way of Kings*
, you would know nothing, and then you'd read
*Warbreaker*
and you'd be like, "Oh, here's a whole past that he had!" That doesn't mean it's all of his past.

#### Footnote

Note from Wetlander: "He's not giving any hints as to whether Vasher had any connection with Roshar prior to
*Warbreaker*
. Or at least not without someone asking a much more direct question."
