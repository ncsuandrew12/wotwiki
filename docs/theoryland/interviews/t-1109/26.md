# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#26)

#### Question

I've gotten both Legion books from Subterranean Press, and I was wondering if you've planned on doing any more through them.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would like to. The thing is, it is kind of a hassle, just because working out release dates and things like that, part of the reason to do—I think they do gorgeous editions—but part of the reason to do the e-book things is so that I can be a little bit more spontaneous in releasing them and things like that, and so I'm likely to continue, but it is a bit hard. This time, we were like, "Why don't you guys just release a limited edition, and we'll do a print edition," but then they were like, "No, please don't do one." So I think I'd go back to letting them do a cheap edition and a limited edition if I did another one with them, I don't know.
