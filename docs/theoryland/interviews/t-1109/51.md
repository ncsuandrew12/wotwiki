# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #51](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#51)

#### Question

In Sixth of the Dusk, it feels like it’s a crossover…

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is true.

#### Question

So is it a planet that we've seen before, or...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Well, you have seen the people they are calling "The Ones Above."

#### Question

And you're not going to tell any more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nope.

#### Question

When will we know?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, fifteen years maybe? Hopefully it won't take me that long, but I only just finished the outlines for Era 3 Mistborn, which is now what we're calling the 1980's, so I haven't even at the moment got the sketches of the sci-fi one, I don't have the outlines and things. So in other words, we aren't to the science fiction era; we're a ways off from that.
