# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #47](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#47)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

\*audio obscured--concerns his involvement with the Infinity Blade series\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

What happened there was, I came in when the first game was already made. They said we'd really like to do something, and I really like the guys, they're friends of mine, and I'm like, "You don't have a story here. You've got to have a protagonist and things like this." So then I said, "Okay, let's take what you have, tell me what you have for the world, and let's brainstorm together, and let's construct a narrative". And so we did it together. We spent a lot of time in their offices constructing the next two games, then I was able to write the novellas between the two.

#### Question

So did you have any input on the game stories, then?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I did. I had a lot of influence, though I did not write the dialogue, so sometimes it's a little bit cringe-worthy. They sent me the script, but I just didn't have time to go over the scripts for them. Sometime I'd like to actually do a game with them, because they make great games.
