# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#30)

#### Question

I read online, something about one of your original drafts, I think it was about Gavilar, and it was where he was blind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah that was actually Taravangian, in the oldest version. One of the very first things I wrote was that, though Taravangian had a different name then, and was very different. Szeth has stayed the same through all the revisions. Kaladin has changed wildly, and almost everybody has changed dramatically, except Szeth is the same person. Him and Dalinar are the same.
