#### Question

Do you have any word on the Mistborn video games that are coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have no official word, other than to say that we did option the rights to the film to the people who are making the video game, and told them, "You have to make the video game or you can't make the film." I actually really like them, and their script treatments on the film are great. And it's not their fault, really, that the game hasn't taken off. It's just that they've had... These things happen in video games. The studio they were working with went under, and another one split, and this sort of stuff happens.
