# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#14)

#### Question

First of all, how confident are you in your race with [Patrick] Rothfuss for use of the word "Stone" in your title?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, it's looking more and more like this might not even be Szeth's book. And if it's not Szeth's book, I may not even name it
*Stones Unhallowed*
; I might name it something else relating to another character, but then again, Kaladin's book was named after the book Dalinar was reading, so anyway. We'll see. I'm pretty sure I will... He has said his "isn't coming out next year," as in coming out this year, and so... I'll have mine done by the end of this year, and it will be coming out next year, so it'll just depend.
