# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#24)

#### Question

Have you come up with the title character for Book 3 of Stormlight yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not. I have to finish
*Calamity*
.

#### Question

Do you still think 2016 is realistic [for Stormlight 3]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it is realistic. One every two years is very realistic for me, and you can just watch along. I'll have
*Calamity*
done by March, and then all I have to do is finish the book by January next year and we'll be fine, so I'll have eight months. Considering I have the outline done, that's about a third of the work for me.
