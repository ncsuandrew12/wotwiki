#### Question

Can women be
*ta'veren*
? Because in the entire series there is not a single female
*ta'veren*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is not, but I'm very sure that they can be, based on things that I read in the notes. So, that's what I would have done, but I don't know if that's what Robert Jordan would have done. Can you just imagine that, Mat having to think that he's in someone else's story now?
