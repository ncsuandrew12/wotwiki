# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#19)

#### Question

So do you ever put a page length limit on yourself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't, but I know by gut generally after I start writing how long a book feels.

#### Question

Does the publisher ever put any limits on you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, they actually haven't. They do ask me if I'll write them shorter, but it's always an ask, and I usually ignore them. In fact,
*Words of Radiance*
is the largest book they can physically print with their printer, but the font is not the smallest font they could do yet. So I could actually get about another 100,000 words longer before it gets unreadable.

#### Question

So by the time we get to Stormlight 6 or 7, they'll have to go buy a new printer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I've warned them. I will write it at the length that feels right.
