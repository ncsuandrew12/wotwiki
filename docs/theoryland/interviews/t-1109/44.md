#### Question

So have you decided whose book is going to be the [focus for Stormlight 3]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not. What I've decided is that I need to actually write out, rather than just having the outlines, write out the three backstories that are left of the first five, and then compare them to the story as I'm writing it, and see which one works. Because any one of them could work, but as I'm writing the book... Yeah. It's one of those things that I know I need the flexibility on, as I write, to make it work.
