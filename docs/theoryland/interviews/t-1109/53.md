#### Question

What was the main inspiration for
*Elantris*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My main inspiration for
*Elantris*
was reading in the New Testament, actually, about lepers and leper colonies, and wanting to write a story about a magical leper colony. And that's where the idea for the people who got this disease, and the city, and everything like that.
