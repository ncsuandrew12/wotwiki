#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually plot
*The Stormlight Archive*
books as a trilogy; each book—like I would plot the entire Reckoners series—I plot that for a book, and then I plot the short story sequence, and then I plot the novella. Usually the flashback sequence is a novella. And so then I write basically three books, a short story collection, and a novella, and put them all together woven as one book.
