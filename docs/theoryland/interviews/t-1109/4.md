#### Wetlander

Prior to becoming pregnant, did the queen spend most of her time at the Shattered Plains, or in the capital?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She has spent most of her time in the capital. She obviously has been back and forth. I would say she has spent more time off the Shattered Plains than at it.

#### Wetlander

But she was at the Shattered Plains, rather than Elhokar going back to the capital?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He has been back at least once, but it is a long trip.
