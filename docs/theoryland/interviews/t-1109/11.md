# [Interview #1109: Firefight Signing Line Audio, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1109#11)

#### Question

I loved the ending of
*Words of Radiance*
. When you come up with an idea for a new cosmere book, do you have to go oh, now I have to figure out how this fits in with everything else, or do you have it pre-made?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have a few little holes that I can slot things into, and I try to get them to fit the roles, like I know there are certain things that need to happen, and if it doesn't fit the role, I just go ahead and make it a minor planet, like
*Shadows for Silence*
, where I can write a story, but I can't put as much magic into those books. So I've got a few restrictions on me, but I think that's important for maintaining the continuity.
