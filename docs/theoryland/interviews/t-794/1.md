# [Interview #794: TGS Signing Report - Barmacral, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=794#1)

#### Barmacral

Warning: Potential spoilers for the entire Mistborn Series, if you do not want to know, do not read ahead!

I was one of the Chicago Storm Leaders, and was able to ask some questions of Brandon before the signing itself, most everything was repeated at the signing at one point or another, except for one detail; Brandon mentioned a tidbit about
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a very small detail in books 4-6, not sure which one that will end up playing a huge role in
*Towers of Midnight*
(might end up being in
*A Memory of Light*
, but pretty sure he said
*Towers of Midnight*
). This is on a scale of Vin's earring in Mistborn, with how that was such a minor detail touched on in book one, and ended up being the key detail that saved the day in the end. That kind of small detail.

#### Barmacral

So, go nuts with your speculation folks.
