## [Entry #1](./t-792/1)

#### Matt Hatch

So, I didn't get to ask many questions. I spent lunch with Brandon, but pestering him with questions seemed inappropriate at the time and the Q&A was after his reading/book signing which I had to leave early.

Oh well.

But two things he did say.

#### Brandon Sanderson

One, recently he read an email a fan sent; this particular fan picked the right small detail. Twoâ€”I asked him regarding the big impact of the small detail and he said we have been discussing this big event, which I felt he implied that we (fandom) have been discussing this big event for a long time.

#### Matt Hatch

As to other questions, I plan to attend DragonCon, so I recommend we get a list of questions together for that event (still have three months).
