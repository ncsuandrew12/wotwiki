## [Entry #1](./t-885/1)

#### Christine

Bittersweet. That word seemed to be the common answer from Team Jordan as they talked about the completion of
*A Memory of Light*
. After 23 years since the first publishing of
*The Eye of the World*
in 1990, the long journey has come to a completion. Harriet McDougal, widow of the late Robert Jordan, and Brandon Sanderson, who has completed the last three books of the series with the help of notes, were joined by the other two members of Team Jordan, Maria Simons and Alan Romanczuk. While Harriet continued to edit the series as Brandon wrote it, Maria worked on continuity, and Alan worked on the great battles and commanders. The entire team was present for the Q&A and signing, and answered a number of questions for those present.

#### Christine

Truly, it was bittersweet, listening to Harriet reading the first paragraph of Chapter One in
*A Memory of Light*
...or
*The Eye of the World*
. That first paragraph, which has stayed with us for a generation, elicited silence from the entire crowd as they simply sat, watched, and listened. It was truly emotional, hearing those words.

[*Ta'veren*
Tees](https://taverentees.com/)
was on site, selling T-shirts, playing cards, posters, and giving away Wheel of Time and Dragon temporary tattoos. Across from them, the last three books of the series were for sale from Barnes & Noble. The entire event was hosted by the
[College of Charleston Addlestone Library](http://www.cofc.edu/library/)
. While most of the action was downstairs, Wheel of Timers flocked to all three levels to look down from the balcony at the Q&A and signing below.
[Special Collections for the College](http://blogs.cofc.edu/thetruesource/)
had a number of displays available, containing other works by Robert Jordan, the books in various languages, and even first draft copies of
*The Eye of the World*
, along with pencil markings.

Hunter Wentworth showed parts of his documentary on the life of Robert Jordan,
[The Wit of the Staircase](http://wots.spiralent.com/wots/The_Wit_of_the_Staircase.html)
, while also recording over three hours of video to help complete the work. Karen Campbell spoke about the
[Waygate Foundation](http://waygatefoundation.org/)
, which brings together fantasy and science fiction authors and fans to help on global philanthropic endeavors. Jennifer Liang spoke about the upcoming
[JordanCon](http://www.jordancon.org/)
in Atlanta, which Brandon Sanderson will be attending this year. The theme is TarVaCon.

Seventeen questions were asked at the Q&A from fans, eliciting a number of responses and laughter from the crowd. The entire event was a spoiler free zone, making it safe for anyone reading this report to continue reading and enjoying all of the Questions and Answers listed below. Around three hundred people participated in the signing, and the Team signed for almost three hours, including taking photos and personalizing books. Backpacks and paperback copies of
*The Way of Kings*
were given away to the crowd, along with some bumper stickers and iPhone covers.

Given that the doors to the library opened at 10:00 and the event didn't start until 3:00, the library was filled with fans reading their new copy of
*A Memory of Light*
or just chit chatting with other fans. New friends were made, along with making plans for JordanCon. It was rather exciting and people enjoyed getting to hang out with other fans. All in all, it was a wonderfully successful event that went smoothly.

## [Entry #7](./t-885/7)

Even Team Jordan had a little something to say to all of Dragonmount!

#### Alan Romanczuk

## [Entry #9](./t-885/9)

#### Question

What happened to the fourth boy from the Two Rivers?

#### Harriet McDougal

Jim originally had good plans for him later on, but when convinced to eliminate him, he realized how easy it was to kill off that story line.

## [Entry #10](./t-885/10)

#### Question

How does it feel now that you are done with the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Bittersweet. Has been reading the series longer than he has had some friends!

#### Harriet McDougal

It was truly done well.

#### Maria Simons

Bittersweet. And wow!

#### Alan Romanczuk

Brain Dead.

## [Entry #11](./t-885/11)

#### Question

Writing Life: How did you sell
*Elantris*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was hard, but it gets easier as you go. An editor can see in one page who has been training for years on their writing. You have to practice for years, and have good writing habits. For example, I was working on book 13 when I sold book 6. Just learn, adapt, and network.

## [Entry #12](./t-885/12)

#### Question

How should a writer get their work in with an editor?

#### Harriet McDougal

Turn off the mad pleasure of creation, and turn on the rational brain.

## [Entry #13](./t-885/13)

#### Question

Which of the great captains do you identify with?

#### Alan Romanczuk

Bela (lots of laughter from everyone). They are all really great.

## [Entry #14](./t-885/14)

#### Question

What is the official land name? Is there anything?

#### Harriet McDougal

Nope.

#### Maria Simons

No real need.

## [Entry #15](./t-885/15)

#### Question

Will you be continuing the comic books?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes!

## [Entry #16](./t-885/16)

#### Question

What do you like most and least working on the novels?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Liked Perrin, and misses writing some of the PoVs. Had to constantly research things to make certain it was accurate, but won't miss fulfilling everything that was foreshadowed...lots of the foreshadowing will be mentioned in the encyclopedia in a year and a half.

#### Harriet McDougal

Two years.

## [Entry #17](./t-885/17)

#### Question

How many volumes will there be for the encyclopedia?

#### Harriet McDougal

One, but it will be fat, and hoping for a disk.

## [Entry #18](./t-885/18)

#### Question

Do pregnancies that occur in the dream world carry over?

#### Maria Simons

If injuries carry over, then why not?

## [Entry #19](./t-885/19)

#### Question

Did Charleston have a lot of influence on the Ogier?

#### Harriet McDougal

The Two Rivers? Ogier Street?

#### Maria Simons

Actually, it was later revealed that Ogier was a subconscious thing, as Jim wanted something close to the term "ogre".

#### Harriet McDougal

And, Jim grew up in a small town, much the same as the Two Rivers in their treatment of strangers.

## [Entry #20](./t-885/20)

#### Question

Will the encyclopedia include only facts, or also speculations?

#### Maria Simons

Everything will be things already known, or else more notes on the characters. And a few other goodies, like the Aes Sedai power scale.

## [Entry #21](./t-885/21)

#### Question

Why is the Last Battle chapter so long?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is two hundred pages, and takes place for almost 24 hours, but the goal was for the reader to feel as exhausted after as the characters themselves did.

#### Fan

It worked!

## [Entry #22](./t-885/22)

#### Question

Will more prequels happen?

#### Harriet McDougal

No. One prequel is enough.

## [Entry #23](./t-885/23)

#### Question

Any of the characters you got caught into?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, so lots of trimming and pruning, and had to write some others back in.

## [Entry #24](./t-885/24)

#### Question

Seems like RJ was a King Arthur fan? Names seem so familiar.

#### Harriet McDougal

It was consciously done.

## [Entry #25](./t-885/25)

#### Question

Do we find out who killed Asmodean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*laughs\* It is in the
*Towers of Midnight*
glossary.

## [Entry #26](./t-885/26)

#### Christine
