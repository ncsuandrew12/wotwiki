# [Interview #623, Entry #9]: Fantasy Magazine Interview - Leigh Butler](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=623#9)

#### Leigh Butler

Obviously you intend to continue with The Stormlight Archive once you've finished The Wheel of Time series. Are there any other new things on the horizon that you're thinking about or looking forward to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've always got dozens of things that I want to do. The ones that end up getting done really kind of depend on the spur of the moment, what I'm feeling, what's exciting to me right when I actually have the time to work on it. I think I've got my plate pretty full right now, so any other projects would be pretty far off. So this probably isn't the time to talk about them. I mean, I've got a couple of fun little things in the works, that I write here and there on the break points, but I don't really want to talk about things until I know when or if they may actually get published. (Laughs) I'm busy enough with the official projects.
