What are your thoughts on conventions like JordanCon (The Wheel of Time convention)? Do you enjoy them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I really like hanging out with fans. I don't particularly like the traveling part. I'm not one of those who absolutely loves going places, though I do like
*having gone*
places. Generally what happens with any sort of travel is, I'm excited when I say yes, and then as it approaches I start to dread it more and more, and I think of all the stuff I need to get done and the hassle it's going to be, and then I get there and have a blast and really enjoy myself. I like meeting all the fans. And then I get home and I'm exhausted and I think to myself "why did I decide to do that, I have so much to do now, it's all piled up!" And then another one comes along and I get excited and say yes again.

So I do enjoy them, and I especially enjoy the Wheel of Time ones, because I get to see a lot of the same people over and over, and it's much less emotionally exhausting to be meeting old friends than it is to be meeting new people. So I've come to really enjoy JordanCon a lot.
