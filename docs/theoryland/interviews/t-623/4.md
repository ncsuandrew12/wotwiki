# [Interview #623: Fantasy Magazine Interview - Leigh Butler, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=623#4)

#### Leigh Butler

Tell me about your series The Stormlight Archive, of which the first book,
*The Way of Kings*
, was published last August. What's the motivation behind writing this story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Stormlight Archiveâ€”you don't grow up reading the books I read, such as the Wheel of Time, without wanting to tell a big epic, and this is kind of what I always wanted to do, to have my own big epic. It's what I love to read and so it's what I want to write. So I've always planned for The Stormlight Archive to be very big, and hopefully meaty and weighty. I started writing about the characters as long as two decades ago, and I finished the first draft of
*The Way of Kings*
in 2002, so almost ten years ago now. So it's a series I've been working on for a long time.

I think you'll find that most authors have series like this; for Robert Jordan it was The Wheel of Time. And people have asked me if I want this to be my Wheel of Time, but that's a very difficult comparison for someone to make. What I want is for this to be a great story, hopefully told really well; it's a story I've been wanting to tell for years and years. And time will tell how that turns out.

#### Leigh Butler

What are your plans for the series as a whole?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will be multi-volume; I pitched it to Tom Doherty [of Tor Books] as ten books, and I envision it as being a project I work on for a very long time, and try to do these audacious things I've wanted to do forever.

It's very art-intensive, and very different from the other books I've done; it incorporates some of the other things I've liked to do from other books, but at the same time it's its own thing. So I view as something awesome that I want to be working on for a long time.

#### Leigh Butler

When is the next book in the series coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm planning the second book to be done following my finishing the Wheel of Time, so it will come, but it will probably be a little while.
