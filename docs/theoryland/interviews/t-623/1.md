# [Interview #623: Fantasy Magazine Interview - Leigh Butler, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=623#1)

#### Leigh Butler

Brandon Sanderson has had an eventful last few years. In addition to his continuing (and growing) success as a fantasy author in his own right, he was famously selected to complete the seminal epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time, after Robert Jordanâ€™s death in September of 2007. Brandon is the author of ten novels and counting (not including the Wheel of Time novels). In this interview, I asked him to talk about his projects both current and future, including the Wheel of Time, and got him to give me some of his thoughts on writing fantasy and science fiction in general.
