# [Interview #623, Entry #7]: Fantasy Magazine Interview - Leigh Butler](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=623#7)

#### Leigh Butler

Are you still teaching creative writing at Brigham Young University?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I am. I teach an upper division class on how to write fantasy and science fiction one night a week, one class a year. It's an evening class, and I do it partially for fun and partially to give something back to the community. I took this class when I was at BYU, and it was very helpful to me in getting published and coming to understand the industry. And so when it looked like the class might end up getting canceled, I said I would teach it.

I think there's a lot of useful stuff you can learn in a class taught by someone who does the work professionally. You can't learn strictly from academics. Academics teach a lot of great things, I learned a lot of things in my creative writing classes, but someone who's in the real world as a writer can tell you things that an academic can't, so I think it's very useful for new writers to get both perspectives.
