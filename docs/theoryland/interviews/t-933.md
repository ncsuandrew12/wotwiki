## [Entry #1](./t-933/1)

#### JeffS

I'll probably post more on the Seattle signing later but it's after midnight and I'm starting to fuzz out around the edges.

Nice to meet you and your daughter Billiam. And on a school night even.

Harriet was as gracious as you would expect and Brandon was really fun when we got him chatting in "Fan" mode.

We had a large crowd, close to 400 I would guess, but it went smoothly.

My favorite signing was a young lady that asked Brandon to inscribe a copy of AMOL with "Good luck on your Midterm tomorrow" for her friend who was in the middle of cramming for an upper level math test. I really hope it helps.

Last impression for the night. Every face had a smile when leaving, including mine.

Hello everyone,

I made it to bed by 1:00 AM but had to be up at 5:00 to head to work. I'm still tired but I can add a bit to Wetlander's post above.

James' sister Melody was our honorary and then fully vested last minute Memory Keeper. She was a big help and really enjoyed being there. Heck, we all had a ton of fun. Emelie and I ran the combination raffle and trivia contest. Some questions I thought were easy had only 3 right answers the whole night.

## [Entry #3](./t-933/3)

#### JeffS

Out of 3 pet theories of mine:
  
One shot down in flames
  
One, could be but I ain't sayin'
  
One, confirmed but by an Aes Sedai answer WHICH ROCKED, once I got my head out and actually thought it through.

I can't expand at this time as I swore "Under the Light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth" that I would not divulge the information. Don't ask Wetlander either as she also swore and as she was dressed as Cadsuane, I'm sure she would feel even more bound by propriety...

## [Entry #4](./t-933/4)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

During the personalization signings, someone asked what the deal was with Alanna's move north and Brandon said unequivocally that she was kidnapped. He didn't say by whom, but I figure since the report to Cadsuane said there were not any residues of channeling to read, it must have been Moridin himself using the True Power.

#### JeffS

So that's one more down of the 7 left unasked.
