#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Near the end of 2007, McDougal found a strong candidate when she read a eulogy blogged by a 31-year-old fantasy writer named Brandon Sanderson.

"I thought it was wonderful," says McDougal. "It was very loving. I wondered if he was any good." She checked out Mistborn, Sanderson's 2006 novel. After 45 pages, she fell asleep.

But when McDougal woke up, his characters and all the book's elements were perfectly clear in her mind. She'd found her guy.
