#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Those two books will be
*Towers of Midnight*
(scheduled for November 2010) and
*A Memory of Light*
(November 2011). Rigney's single concluding volume has become three because there's just too much story to cram into one book; 750,000 words would be impossible to bind. "Even Jordan couldn't have written everything he left in one volume, although he thought he could," said McDougal in a Dragonmount blog. "But you recall that he thought he could write the entire Wheel in six volumes."

Although Sanderson produced
*The Gathering Storm*
quickly and efficiently, McDougal understands that the ending can't be rushed. She quotes from the Jack Nicholson movie Wolf: "If you push a deadline, you get a first draft," she says. "If Brandon needs the time, he needs the time. It's gotta be good."

Meanwhile she's under contract to develop a Wheel of Time encyclopedia, and Rigney is the focus of
*The Wit of the Staircase*
, a documentary by local filmmaker Hunter Wentworth, son of South Carolina poet laureate Marjory Wentworth. The series continues to gain new admirers, and there are ongoing rumors of TV and film adaptations.
