# [Interview #504: Charleston City Paper Interview, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=504#3)

#### Nick Smith

By contrast, Charlestonians tended to treat Rigney like a regular fellow. When his first Wheel of Time best-seller
*The Eye of the World*
came out in 1990, they would greet him with, "Hi Jim, are you still writing?"

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

While McDougal admits that they could have lived a quiet life anywhere if they'd chosen, Charleston was their home and a place where Rigney could work at his own, often breakneck, pace. Every day he would get up, have breakfast, then pad down the yard to his desk in his carriage house. The pages he forged there were packed with intense battle scenes, dense interwoven plots, and a vast cast of characters. This material was tempered by McDougal, Rigney's assistant Maria Simons, and series continuity manager Alan Romanczuk.
