# [Interview #504: Charleston City Paper Interview, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=504#10)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

McDougal had gone on tour many times with her husband, where she says she "just lurked in the back." Sometimes she would find a book to read in the store they were visiting, get through a chapter, then continue reading with another copy in the next town. Every now and again people would track her down and ask, "Are you Harriet? Would you sign my book?"

With Rigney gone, McDougal found herself front and center at
*The Gathering Storm*
events. "The tour was amazing," she says. "It was awful to be out there without my husband. At the same time, people were so kind. They said, 'Thank you for finishing the series. Thank you for Robert Jordan.'"
