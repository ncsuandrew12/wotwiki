#### Question

(I mentioned I had a question about Paalm) So in Shadows of Self, when TenSoon and Was are fighting the spiked creature things, TenSoon mention that he was Harmony's "Preservation."

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Brandon seemed a bit apprehensive about that statement.)

#### Question

And he said that Wax was Harmony's "Ruin."

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Still aprehensive) Yes...

#### Question

Well since Harmony has been around for about 300 years someone else would have had to fill that role, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably...

#### Question

And could that person possibly have been Paalm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe...
