#### Djarskublar

So I could be wrong, but a Hemalurgic spike, when you use it and become a savant it does damage to your Spiritweb, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes Hemalurgy always hurts you. (I think he was saying that the Hemalurgy itself hurts you more than being a savant, but I'm not sure how to interpret this)

#### Djarskublar

So say you go to Roshar and you give somebody a Hemalurgic spike for some Allomantic power, don't care what, and you use it to become a savant. Does that qualify them as 'broken' enough to become a Radiant? As long as they are also following the Ideals to attract a spren.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So becoming a Radiant is a spectrum of terminologies. It... probably, but you would have to find a Radiant who would, or a spren who would be willing to touch that, okay? It's going to drive them back.

#### Djarskublar

So would it also affect your probability of becoming an Elantrian?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah it would affect your ability to become anything else, yes.

#### Djarskublar

Okay, so would it be a positive effect, negative effect...? Because I was like, it gives you cracks in your Spiritweb.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does give you cracks in your Spiritweb.

#### Djarskublar

So it's easier for Investiture to get in. Does it make it easier for other Investitures to get in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would make it... yes. It's going to drive spren away. So what it's really going to make easier for, there, is spren and Investiture that doesn't care.

#### Djarskublar

Okay, so Investiture doesn't care but spren do.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Investiture might care depending on if it's part of a Shard-- if it has intent and things like this.

#### Djarskublar

So it might let Stormlight in easier than a Breath, type thing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm saying it might let Odium in easier than Syl. Because Syl would care, and Odium would not care.

#### Djarskublar

Okay cool.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, so it could be a really bad thing, is what I'm trying to say to you.

#### Djarskublar

Yeah that's cool. I just want to know more about gold too. Gold Allomancy too. Because Miles was doing some funky stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Miles was doing some funky stuff.
