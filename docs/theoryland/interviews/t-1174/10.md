# [Interview #1174: Dark Talent release party, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1174#10)

#### Question

He asked if Kel had been born on Roshar, and something similar happened to him, would he be able to communicate with the living via Death Rattle.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My understanding (of what I remember of what he paraphrased... Not a solid source) is that Brandon said it would be similar to a Rattle, but not the same.
