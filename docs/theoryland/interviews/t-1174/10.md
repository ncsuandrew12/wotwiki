#### Question

He asked if Kel had been born on Roshar, and something similar happened to him, would he be able to communicate with the living via Death Rattle.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My understanding (of what I remember of what he paraphrased... Not a solid source) is that Brandon said it would be similar to a Rattle, but not the same.
