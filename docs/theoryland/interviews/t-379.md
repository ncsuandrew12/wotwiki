## [Entry #1](./t-379/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Just a quick update here. I've finished the
*Alcatraz*
3 revision, and have sent it off to my editor. Next up is the
*Warbreaker*
copyedit.

## [Entry #2](./t-379/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've begun to get pages back on the sections of
*A Memory of Light*
I sent to Harriet, and the responses are very encouraging. There are things I need to change, of course, but that's the case in any book. Mostly, she's asked me to be more descriptive in places. We've also got Alan and Maria working full time catching inconsistencies and the like. But I'm really enjoying the process. Harriet is a world class editorâ€”she really is great at what she does.

## [Entry #3](./t-379/3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyway, back to
*Alcatraz*
News, I did want to point out that the Paperback of
*Alcatraz Versus The Evil Librarians*
should begin appearing in stores sometime soon. The official release date is November 1st, so I'll do more posts on it later. However, Scholastic has been known to ship books as much as a month early, so you might see this one on shelves pretty soon.

*Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones*
(book two of the series) is coming out November 1st as well. People have been asking me when I'll post sample chapters, and the answer is later in October. I'm pretty focused on Mistborn Three right now, but Alcatraz will get his day in the sun too. In fact, here's a fun picture for you:

Yes, indeed, that is the wonderful Kaytoo cosplaying an Evil Librarian at MountainCon. She even has kittens with her. (Part of the great kitten conspiracy.) Thanks, Lorna! I think this is the first time I've run into a cosplayer from one of my books at a convention.
