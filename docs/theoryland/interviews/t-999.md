## [Entry #1](./t-999/1)

#### KakitaOCU

So panel went well. Unfortunately the questions never really got into specifics of the series, was more about his experiences with Harriet and Team Jordan and his thoughts about the project in general.

He did have a few interesting things to say about the series and story specifically though.

## [Entry #2](./t-999/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He stated straight out that Lanfear had additional plans in motion that can be figured out based on
*A Memory of Light*
that none of the fandom has found yet (or at least not posted). He was asked for specifics and gave a RAFO, then specified he meant that in terms of re-reading
*A Memory of Light*
.

He confirmed that Lanfear's compulsion of Perrin was only in
*A Memory of Light*
and that she didn't like using it and so had not done so in their previous meeting back in the early books.

## [Entry #3](./t-999/3)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Re: Deaths of major characters. His statement was that Jordan had left ending situations for nearly every character and that, with only two exceptions, if Jordan didn't specify, they had the character live. He confirmed one of those exceptions was Harriet's decision re: Siuan. He did not reveal the other.

## [Entry #4](./t-999/4)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

The idea of Compelling the Great Captains was one he and Harriet worked up. The notes apparently just stated that several of the Great Captains died and then everything was given to Mat. Since it was so vague, they had to come up with a reason for WHY the world would trust Mat like that.

## [Entry #5](./t-999/5)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He acknowledged why Asmodean's killer was revealed the way it was. Apparently when he got the "Notes" from Harriet there was a sticky note on the top that just said "Graendal killed Asmodean" with no further explanation or notes. So they thought it'd be fun to provide the same type of blank answer to the rest of the community.

## [Entry #6](./t-999/6)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Re: Tuon and Arthur Hawkwing's meeting. Brandon said #1: That while Hawkwing might have issues with certain aspects of Seanchan society, as a whole he would have found Tuon and her people to be awesome. He further said the reason he didn't show the conversation is because that and the fall out was supposed to be part of the outriggers that we won't see, and so Brandon wanted to leave that open the way Jordan would have.

## [Entry #7](./t-999/7)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Jordan made the decision of the True Nature of the Dark One. He said that straight out. He and Harriet rewrote and developed the battle the way it turned out, with the possible futures, etc. But the true key of the Dark ONe being needed for the world and Rand having to discover that and just restore the prison were Jordan's directive.

## [Entry #8](./t-999/8)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Lastly, and IMO, most important. While he stated he was paraphrasing from memory, he revealed the "two sentences" that Jordan had left for the outriggers. The first was a scene of Mat in a wool cap laying in a gutter having gambled away everything. The second was a scene with Perrin on a ship thinking that he was going to have to go kill a friend.
