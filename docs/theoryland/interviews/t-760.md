My keen-eyed neighbor Harriet Popham Rigney says a visitor should check out the tombstone in the Huguenot graveyard that always has flowers on itâ€”"and on Sunday a glass of wine." Among the old families of Charleston, most of whom have sold centuries-old family dwellings, sheâ€™s fascinated by the feuds that linger. For visitors "of standing," she adds, "you should definitely go to the St. Cecilia Society Ballâ€”but you can't." Admission to this holiest of holies is restricted to bloodlines of the color blue. One of the city's great scandals occurred three-quarters of a century ago when an upstart newspaper dared to print a story about the ball. It is a matter not of secrecy, but of privacy. Those who go are those who know.
