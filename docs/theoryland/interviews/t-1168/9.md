#### Question

And lastly I asked him if Hoid had to describe Khriss, as in what he thought about her, what would be say.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And Brandon mentioned that it was good because Hoid had actually met Khriss, and then he wrote in my book verbatim, "Hoid thinks well of Khriss." Which I find particularly interesting, especially considering his opinion of the 17th Shard, as expressed in the First Letter.
