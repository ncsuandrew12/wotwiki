# [Interview #1168: BYU Bookstore, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1168#28)

#### Question

I also attended the event and asked if anyone on Scadrial was cosmere aware pre-Lord Ruler.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said yes (including Leras and Ati).

#### Footnote

After looking a bit more into this I found that someone else was also thinking along the same lines and got a more detailed confirmation from Brandon:

Kwaan was cosmere-aware and trees can think.
