#### Question

In the signing line, I asked him what would have been included in a hypothetical Nalthian essay had there been one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said it would have talked about how close the scholars there were to being Cosmere aware, and how they knew more than anyone who wasn't a worldhopper. He also said he would have given clues to where the pool was.
Also, he wrote "Are you listening?" In my book, although I have no idea what was meant by that.
