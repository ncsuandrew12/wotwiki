# [Interview #1168: BYU Bookstore, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1168#1)

#### Question

#### Brandon Sanderson

we will be seeing the actual Ghostbloods symbol at some point. He said that they actually had a draft at one point, but that it wasn't true enough to the book, so they're working on it some more. Also, he said there're a few really good interpretations around the internet, so there's that.
