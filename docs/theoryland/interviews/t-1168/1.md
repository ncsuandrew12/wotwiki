#### Question

First, and I think we already knew this, but I wanted to confirm, as it's of great interest to me:

#### Brandon Sanderson

we will be seeing the actual Ghostbloods symbol at some point. He said that they actually had a draft at one point, but that it wasn't true enough to the book, so they're working on it some more. Also, he said there're a few really good interpretations around the internet, so there's that.
