#### Question

At what point did you decide how Alcatraz 5 would end? I mean, obviously you always knew that Alcatraz was going to end up on the altar, but at what point did you decide Attica's fate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Pretty much right from the start. After four books of Alcatraz telling everyone he's a coward and a liar, there needed to be a truly horrible event to justify his feeling like a failure and refusing to accept the hero worship. I hesitated about putting that in a kid's book, but ultimately it was necessary for the story. Without a real, tragic experience in his life, Alcatraz's pessimism would have just seemed silly.
