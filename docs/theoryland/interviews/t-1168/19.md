# [Interview #1168: BYU Bookstore, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1168#19)

#### Question

First, I asked the question above about if there is a power loss when a feruchemist switches powers from one metal-mind to another.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said (paraphrasing) the power does have to enter the person, and there is a very little power loss. Less than we'd probably think.
