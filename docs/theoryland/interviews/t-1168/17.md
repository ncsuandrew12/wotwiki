# [Interview #1168: BYU Bookstore, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1168#17)

#### Question

Then finally I asked if Vasher and Nightblood were separated before or after coming to Roshar (I kind of felt like this had probably been asked before but I couldn't find any info on it so I went ahead),

#### Brandon Sanderson

and after hesitating for a minute, he said that they were separated after.
