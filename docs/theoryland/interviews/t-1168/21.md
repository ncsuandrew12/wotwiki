#### Question

Third, my written question was "How will the everstorm affect Vasher?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wrote: "Vasher will probably just hide, but it signals something bad for him..." Then he said out loud (paraphrasing) that we will find out what this means in a LONG time.

#### Footnote

I should have pressed him for more information, but I was just SO excited to have my oldest girls with me and to have them meet him. My impression from this was that we'd see very little of Vasher in the rest of the front 5 Stormlight Archive.
