#### Question

no question

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also, during the Q&A he told a story about playing Mistborn RPG at I believe Gen Con were he met a fan dressed up like a Terrisman, from bald head to toe, who was really disappointed he wasn't going to be able to join the campaign. Brandon, however, told him that he could be his butler and the man proceeded to fetch him water and roll his dice, and ultimately ended up as a character in Mistborn Era 2!!! :)

#### Footnote

another commenter said Close. It was actually Tellingdwar. :)
