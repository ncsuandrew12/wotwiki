# [Interview #1168: BYU Bookstore, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1168#16)

#### Question

Then I just asked for general information on Elend's mom.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that Elend takes after her a lot more than he does Straff, and then I asked if she had much of an influence on him growing up and who he became as a person and Brandon said yes, she did. (paraphrasing, my phone was dead at this point so I couldn't record it for exact wording) Just a bit of character info that's probably not too consequential, but interesting nonetheless.
