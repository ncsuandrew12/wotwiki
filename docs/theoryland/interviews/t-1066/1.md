# [Interview #1066: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: The Wheel of Time Nominated for a Hugo Award, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1066#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Time, as a whole, has been nominated for a
[Hugo Award](http://loncon3.org/2014hugos.php)
for best novel. I am thrilled, honored, and excitedâ€”and when Harriet heard the news, she lit up as I've never seen her do before. Thank you.

Congratulations to all of the other nominees! I have a few things I'd like to say about this nomination. First, I'd like to speak to Wheel of Time fans themselves. Secondly, I'd like to speak to those who are criticizing the nomination.
