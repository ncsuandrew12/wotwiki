Hey Brandon, just wanted to say, thanks for finishing the Wheel of Time. Halfway through
*A Memory of Light*
right now and it is fantastic, you really did an incredible job.

I am sad WoT is finally over...but now we have Stormlight, which is shaping up to be magnificent. Can't wait for the next book!

Many thanks. Hope you enjoy the ending.

I like the part where Rand is really the name of the sled from his childhood.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And Perrin was a ghost all along.

I just want you to know that I have a job interview on Thursday-Friday and am refusing to get
*A Memory of Light*
until Friday evening, because I know I will stay up all night reading and stumble around like a zombie the next day if I get it now.

Very much looking forward to it, though. In this long time fantasy fan's opinion, your contribution (and, dare I say, reboot) was the best thing to ever happen to WoT.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. Well, good luck with the interview.

#### opsomath

Hey, thanks.

Another book?? I cannot wait to delve into it. I started on your books with
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
. Then I picked up
*Emperor's Soul*
because the story looked intriguing and omg the cover art was so brilliant, and now am reading
*The Way of Kings*
. I have to say I became an instant fan, I cannot wait to read your other books. I love the way you portray your characters. I don't know if you will ever see this but thank you, your book, your writings they filled me with hope.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did see it. Thank you for reading, and for the kind words.
