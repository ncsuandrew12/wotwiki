Just wanted to say, I love the way you interact with the community. I have only started reading your books in the past year or so (and I've read them all already), and I love your writing style.

When it comes to Wheel of Time, I think you nailed it, Jordan's books got a bit muddy and slow towards the end, but as soon as I get to your 3 it becomes exciting and I honestly think your wrote it better than Robert could have.

I doubt I deserve that particular compliment, but thank you for the kind words.
