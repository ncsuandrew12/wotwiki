# [Interview #943: Reddit 2013 (WoT), Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=943#10)

#### [RockguyRy (March 2013)](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1alj0w/sanderson_ama/c8ytf2d)

I want to echo comments about how wonderful of a job you did juggling this epic and bringing it to a satisfying conclusion.

I do have one question: Was the inclusion of Dannil always planned in your mind or did your re-read of WoT and seeing Jordan's notes on the potential main fourth character revive him? I have to say, seeing him—after knowing his importance from your discussion during the re-read—was one of the dozen moments that made me tear up.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My upping (by just a slight amount) of this character's place in the last few books came exactly because of the reasons you mentioned. It was not planned until I had conversations with Harriet about the character, and I came to have a specific affection for him because of them.
