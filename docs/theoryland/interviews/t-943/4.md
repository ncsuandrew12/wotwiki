# [Interview #943: Reddit 2013 (WoT), Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=943#4)

Sanderson AMA? I know he already did one about a year ago, but I remember hearing he was planning on doing another AMA a couple months after the last book came out so we could ask some wrap-up questions. Is this still in the works?

As mentioned in this thread elsewhere, I will be doing it on the 15th of April. I chose the date so there would be time for those waiting for the ebook to at least have a chance to read some before the AMA.

I chose
[/r/fantasy](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy)
because the mod there has been asking me for some time, and I feel he does a wonderful job with the community. However, I intend this to be for AMOL, and will happily answer WoT questions.

I'm always willing to answer questions when people find me in a thread, however, and have something they want answered. If you have one or two now, I'd give you a reply (do use the spoiler tags if needed).

I'm trying real hard to think of a question to ask you that I know you can answer but the ones I have, you've already stated that they are meant to be unanswered.

So instead I'll just take this opportunity to thank you for an epic conclusion to a large portion of my life. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. So thank you for your part in that magnificent ending.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was an honor. I say that a lot, but I mean it.
