# [Interview #943: Reddit 2013 (WoT), Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=943#1)

Do you think that there will be post AMoL books that follow Rand or his children at any point in time, or is the Wheel of Time series done for good?

Edit: Actually more like the Wheel of Time universe, since the series that lead to the last battle is completed.

Edit2: Also sorry if you mentioned that you were or weren't going to continue with that universe already, but I had to ask. I just finished the book today at 3:30 am and I just don't want to move on... :(

Sorry for the slow reply. Haven't been around much lately. I figured you'd still want some sort of response, however.

There is no more. I'm sorry. I understand not wanting to move on (I still hope for some good video games or films that will let you explore the world more) but I don't feel comfortable going forward in the world any more. I'm confident Robert Jordan wouldn't have wanted it. He didn't leave enough notes for future books that I feel they would be able to be true to his voice.

I'm sad about this too, honestly. I love the world and the characters. But all good things must end, and it is for the strength of the work as a whole that I think we must allow this one to conclude.

Thanks for the reply, I'm honestly surprised you got around to it. I've actually picked up
*The Way of Kings*
and it is a really good story so far, I am loving the awesome world you've created. It's totally taking my mind off of WoT. Anyways, thanks again for the reply, hopefully we get a sweet video game or movie soon or we at least get an updated WOT MUD.
