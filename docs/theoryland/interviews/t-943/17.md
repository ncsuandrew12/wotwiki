A note for those curious, but a spoiler for the ending. Regarding the AMOL one, have you noticed yet that Rand, to an extent, did this very thing?

#### [Mithre](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1glwu9/amol_just_finished_the_chapter_older_more/calpwnn)

Is it just how he imprisoned the Dark One without killing him? Or did I miss something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The usual way to take a person
*gai'shain*
is to touch them while they are holding a weapon. Rand seized and held the Dark One in his hand, then chose not to kill him, instead taking him prisoner.
