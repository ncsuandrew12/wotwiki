#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*A Memory of Light*
news, you might notice a little slowdown on the percentage bar these next few weeks. I need to do a revision of what I've done already and send it off to Harriet. I'll still be writing some new material, but not as much as during the break-neck speed of July and August. I'm still thinking I'm on schedule to have 400k by December 31st. Now, as to whether or not that will actually be the full novel . . . we'll see. (Hint, I'm betting it's not.)
