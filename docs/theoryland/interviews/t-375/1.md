# [Interview #375: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Annotations (Finally) Plus notes, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=375#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

First off, here are two new
*Mistborn: The Well of Ascension*
Annotations

[Chapter Forty-Two](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/234/Mistborn-2-Chapter-Forty-Two)
  
[Chapter Forty-Three](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/235/Mistborn-2-Forty-Three)

These are two of the most dynamic chapters in the book, so I'm glad to finally have annotations for them. Sorry to take so long.
