# [Interview #375: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Annotations (Finally) Plus notes, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=375#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

What else is there to talk about . . . oh, the Poster Contest. My business manager (aka my lovely wife) should soon be sending out confirmation emails to those who have entered. I'll continue on more slowly through my inbox to give you personal responses, in case you included other questions or comments. And if you haven't entered the contest yet, you've still got plenty of time. I have to say, these Mistborn Two posters look quite stunning. A lot of people think that it has the best cover in the hardcover trilogy.

Now, don't forget the release party for Mistborn Three on the 14th of October! I will be posting more news on that soon, including an explanation on how those of you who live out of state can get a signed/numbered copy mailed to you.
