# [Interview #424: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Reader Mail, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=424#1)

#### Dave

Just a quick question . . . I purchased Mistborn 3 signed from Sam Weller's (and just ordered my
*Warbreaker*
signed copy as well). Are you going to offer signed and numbered copies of
*The Gathering Storm*
? I read your blog pretty regularly, but may have missed you already addressing this question. If so, sorry!

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think I've mentioned the possibility, Dave, but never given anything firm. Well, I've been doing some asking, and it seems that Harriet and Tor are all right with this. So, I'm about 95% sure that this is going to happen with the
*The Gathering Storm*
. We'll probably do signed/personalized/numbered editions from Sam Weller's by mail AND will do a release party at BYU Bookstore again. The release party will probably be a midnight release, followed by me flying to Charleston to do another event in the evening of the release day.

I can't say how many books we'll release to Sam Weller's to sell this way. The numbered editions I do at these release parties aren't to replace the leatherbound collector's editions that Tor does. (I think they're doing one for
*The Gathering Storm*
, though I don't know.) My numbered editions have no capâ€”I number as many, generally, as there are people. (Note that Sam Weller's still has some
*Warbreaker*
copies that I'm going to go in and personalize for people tomorrow, so if you want one, give them a call.) Mostly, the numbers are just to say "Hey, I got the book from one of the release events. Isn't that cool?" But I could see so many being requested from Sam Weller's that we have to cap it to save my hand (and my sanity.)

Anyway, that's a long way to say yes, Dave. Keep an eye on the blog. We'll try to get the announcements for these events up earlier than we did for
*Warbreaker*
.
