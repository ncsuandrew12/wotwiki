# [Interview #686: Piers Anthony - Letters to Jenny, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=686#1)

#### Michael Macchione

Last night, I was reading the book
*Letters to Jenny*
by Piers Anthony. When I was shocked to find Piers Anthony mentioning Robert Jordan. First a little background. In Feb. '89 Anthony was contacted by a 12-year-old girl's mother, who said that Jenny had been the victim of a drunk driving accident and was in a coma. Since Jenny was a big fan, her mother hoped a letter from Anthony might help bring it out of the coma. It did help and Anthony started to write once a week to Jenny about this, that and the other thing.
*Letters to Jenny*
is a compilation of the letters that he wrote in the first year.

Anthony mentions RJ in two separate letters as being a worthwhile author. After finishing the book, I cannot remember any other author that he mentions that he is not currently working with.

Here are the relevant parts of the two letters, which might interest people:
