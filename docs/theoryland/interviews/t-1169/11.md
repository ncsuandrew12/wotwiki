#### Question

In the written novel of Warbreaker there is a scene where Vasher uses a special command to put all of his Breath into a rope except for his Divine Breath, but it doesn't say what command he uses. In the same scene in the Graphic Audio version, Vasher says, "My Breath to give, for life to live." Is that command canon or was that a construct of the Graphic Audio team?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd have to check with Peter and/or Isaac, but I \*think\* it is canon. Basically you can treat is as being canon for now.
