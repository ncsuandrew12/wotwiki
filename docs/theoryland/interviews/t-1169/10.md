#### Question

Can a Returned give their Divine Breath to someone else like how a regular Nathian would give their Breath away? Ie: would that then make the recipient "Divine" or elevate them to the 5th heightening?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They can give their Divine Breath away but it wouldn't make the recipient divine or anything. Basically, this is how they heal someone- by using the "My life to yours, my Breath become yours" command.
