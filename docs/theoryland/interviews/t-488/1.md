#### Brandon Sanderson

For the holidays this year, I thought I'd post a short story for you all. In fact, I'm posting "
[Defending Elysium](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/53/Recent-Short-Stories-Defending-Elysium)
," which I generally regard as the best short story I've ever written. Now, that's not saying a whole lot, as I'm a novelist. That's the form I've practiced, and writing short stories is a very different art. I'm constantly in awe of what great short story writers (like my friend
[Eric James Stone](http://www.ericjamesstone.com/blog/home/)
) can do with just a few pages.

You'll note that even this "short" story is actually more of a novelette. It even has several different character viewpoints and two or three sub-plots to go along with the main storyline and the main thematic elements. (I can't compress my thoughts any farther. I guess I'm just a novelist at heart.) Also, note that if you've already read "Defending Elysium," I've also added an

for you to give an explanation of the history of the story.
