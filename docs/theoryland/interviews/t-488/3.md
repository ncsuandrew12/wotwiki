#### Brandon Sanderson

Next year, I will be spending a lot of the early months blogging about
*The Way of Kings*
. A lot of people have been asking about it, and Tor has nudged me to begin speaking about it more. There WILL be more info about
*Towers of Midnight*
too, but I'll probably be holding off on that for a while. I know you're hungry for more information. I'll give you what I can, but I've been asked to be more secretive about these books than I normally am, and (as I have said before) I feel it is respectful to keep to Harriet's wishes.

(Progress on
*Towers of Midnight*
is going well, but this is—in many ways—a much BIGGER book than
*The Gathering Storm*
. There are a lot more viewpoints and plots to wrangle, including many people who were not seen in
*The Gathering Storm*
.
*The Gathering Storm*
was very focused by intention and design.
*Towers of Midnight*
is going to feel very different, as we're going to be expanding the scope a little to include all of the things we need to see to get ready for the Last Battle. That's making the editing and revision process of what I've done go more slowly than I would have liked.)
