# [Interview #488: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Happy Koloss Head-Munching Day! (Free Short Story), Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=488#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyway, thank you all for making this such a wonderful year. The tour was amazing, and the response to
*The Gathering Storm*
was incredible. I'm humbled by your responseâ€”including the responses of those who had complaints about the book. (Often legitimate ones.) There weren't many of those, and the bulk of the ones I read were presented in a thoughtful, non-combative way. You are a classy bunch. Thank you for that.

Tomorrow is the long-celebrated, and often disturbing, Koloss Head-Munching Day. Munch a head and read the short story. Or, if you're not into that, I believe there are a few other holidays coming up. . . .
