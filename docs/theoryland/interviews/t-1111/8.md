#### gpmushu

Has the Thrill existed longer than the Death Rattles or have they both been occurring for about the same period of time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Thrill and the Death Rattles started around the same time, but the locations for the two fluctuate and have been since they appeared.

#### Footnote

This note is from the forums: (This is just a way of confirming that the Unmade have been active for about the same amount of time. Both started around the time Gavilar started to explore the Shattered Plains according to Taravangian.)
