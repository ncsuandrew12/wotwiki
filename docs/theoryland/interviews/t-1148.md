## [Entry #1](./t-1148/1)

#### Kayla

Is the use of the color red before/during bad events a deliberate pattern?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. ((this is made worse because every personalized book I saw had “hands all red….” written in them. I AM AFRAID.))

## [Entry #2](./t-1148/2)

#### Kayla

Is it possible to use a Steelpush while wearing Shardplate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

After some confusion re: not Pushing on the Plate, but something else: yes. And we… think the mass of the plate would be what determined the force needed, not its (much lighter) effective weight to the bearer.

## [Entry #3](./t-1148/3)

#### Kogi

Sarene’s eye color?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Email Peter. (I will actually do it this time!)

## [Entry #4](./t-1148/4)

#### Kogi

Anything you can tell us about santhids?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re one of a few Rosharan animals with a degree of sentience. It’s easier on Roshar for this to happen.

#### Kayla

Because of Cultivation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Footnote

Also, Santhids aren’t based on anything in particular on Earth (sad marine biologist face)

#### Tags

Cultivation

## [Entry #5](./t-1148/5)

#### Granvil4

I asked if Sazed is the only one to hold more than one Shard.

#### Brandon Sanderson

“Sazed is the only one to currently hold two Shards.” After a few seconds, he added, “I’m not going to say he is the only one to ever hold two.” That’s all he said about it though.

## [Entry #6](./t-1148/6)

#### PallonianFire

Does Khriss have a way of changing her appearance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #7](./t-1148/7)

#### PallonianFire

Is Vathi Khriss?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, someone else. But you'll see Khriss in a soon-to-be-published book.
