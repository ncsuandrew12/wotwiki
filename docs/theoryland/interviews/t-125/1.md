# [Interview #125: WH Signing Report - Brian, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=125#1)

#### Brian

So Jordan comes out just before 7pm.

He walks to the edge of the platform where the table he is to be signing books is upon and starts talking. "It's Egwene" as he starts to run off a few names I am guessing people have hounded him about before. The one that got me was Aiel. Yeah the back of the books has the phonetic spelling but I always said 'Ale'.

Anyways, he signed two books for each person and then said if we were going to have any more signed, we would have to go back to the end of the line. Not too bad since he got through the line in an hour or so.

He was asked so many things that I thought I would just throw them all out before I forget.
