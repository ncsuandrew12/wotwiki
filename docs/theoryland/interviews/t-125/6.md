# [Interview #125: WH Signing Report - Brian, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=125#6)

#### Robert Jordan

Talked about The Citadel and the workouts. Said that now for the long runs the cadets are allowed to wear sneakers but when he was there, they had to run in their combat boots. Said that it is because of the new women recruitsâ€”that they get shin splints running in the boots. Actually said "As big as I am, I once had to run a 15k in my combat boots."
