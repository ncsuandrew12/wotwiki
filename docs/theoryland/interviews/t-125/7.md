# [Interview #125: WH Signing Report - Brian, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=125#7)

#### Robert Jordan

He went on about other things but all in all, he was a nice guy who was down to earth. Actually made a joke about Anne Rice too. The owner of the book store thanked him and then thanked those that had come to the signing. Jordan said: "Well I usually don't get the type that want the books signed in their own blood. Or even come to the signing in a coffin... wait, that was Anne Rice herself."

His wife was seen wandering around the store but never came to the table.
