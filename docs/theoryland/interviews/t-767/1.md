# [Interview #767: WorldCon 2009 - Dom, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=767#1)

#### Dom

I went to the Brandon Sanderson signing/Q&A in Montreal.

He's as nice in person as he appears to be online.

A lot of it dealt with
*Way of Kings*
, of course (but not much about Mistborn and
*Warbreaker*
).

As expected, there were no huge revelations about WoT, but a few interesting tidbits, some by implication. Brandon fears spoiling people coming to these Q&A, so he's not even willing to discuss/mention the specific information which he knows is already around (for instance, to acknowledge that
*The Gathering Storm*
deals mostly with Egwene and Randâ€”he's telling people who want to know to look around on WoT sites for that).
