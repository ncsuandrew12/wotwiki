#### Dom

#### Brandon Sanderson

About Harriet, Brandon revealed that not only did she provide most of the chapter titles and decide on the icons and maps (which we already knew) but she is also the one who handled the titles for most of the books. So those multi-layered titles that fit the main themes of each book and the opening quotes so well, or bring back metaphors or details from earlier books are actually hers, not RJ. Exceptionally, he's the one who came up with
*A Memory of Light*
for the last book as he was working on it. Normally it's Harriet who came up with a title after reading the full manuscript.
