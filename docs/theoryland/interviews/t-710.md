## [Entry #1](./t-710/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Every year for the past several years,
*Name of the Wind*
and
*The Wise Man's Fear*
author (and good buddy of mine) Patrick Rothfuss has run a charity drive where he matches at 50% donations to Heifer International through his Worldbuilders team page. Everyone who enters the general drawing gets a chance at a huge number of prizes. There are also individual auctions on several of the most desirable items.
[Pat explains it best.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2011/12/worldbuilders-2011/)

I've donated various books to the prize pool before, and this year I and
[Badali Jewelry](http://www.badalijewelry.com/)
have teamed up to donate a special Wheel of Time package to the auctions. My contribution is from among my personal leatherbound copies of
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
. With each Wheel of Time book that is released, Tor puts out a limited edition of 126 signed copies, 100 of them numbered for commercial release, and 26 of them lettered for publisher and author use. I received copies B and S of both books, and I'm donating the matched set of S copies.

Please see Pat's description below. The auction itself is

, and you can see the other auction items
[here](http://www.ebay.com/sch/worldbuilders/m.html)
. And remember, for every 10 dollars you donate on the Worldbuilders
[Team Page](http://sphere.heifer.org/c.swL1KcNZLxH/b.5547921/k.86F6/Team_Search/siteapps/teampage/ShowPage.aspx?c=swL1KcNZLxH&b=5547921&sid=boIMISPnH9KILNOmHjE)
, you get a chance to win a book from the general prize pool.
