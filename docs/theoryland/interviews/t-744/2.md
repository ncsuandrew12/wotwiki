#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's Suvudu Cage Match features
[Moiraine versus Jardir](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/03/cage-match-2012-round-3-moiraine-damodred-versus-jardir.html)
and
[Kelsier versus Ray Lilly](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/03/cage-match-2012-round-3-kelsier-versus-ray-lilly.html)
. If both Moiraine and Kelsier win, they will be up against each other next week, which would mean that (barring fires to put out) I would be inclined to do a writeup of my own. They have to survive this week before you get to see that though, and both have worthy opponents. Voting ends on Thursday.
