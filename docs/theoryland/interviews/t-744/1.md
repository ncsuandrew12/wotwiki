The newest
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
[annotation](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/449/Alcatraz-Chapter-Five)
discusses my use of prison names, the setting, and Bastille. And I'm very pleased to announce that the audiobook for
[*Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones*](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B007L772XI&qid=1332271130&sr=1-1)
is finally available. The other two audiobooks will follow within a few months. Rutabaga.
