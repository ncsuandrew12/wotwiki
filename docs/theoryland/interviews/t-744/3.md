# [Interview #744, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: ALCATRAZ 2 Audiobook, Trailers & Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=744#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Next month I'll be traveling to Australia for
[SwanCon (a.k.a. Doom-Con)](https://2012.swancon.com.au/)
in Perth and
[Supanova](http://www.supanova.com.au/)
in Melbourne and Gold Coast. Below is a trailer for Doom-Con. Details are on my events page.

Also,
[this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkjLqKVp5yg)
was shared with me on Facebook: ninth-grader Morgan Nielsen created the following trailer for
*The Way of Kings*
for a book report in her English class. Pretty cool.
