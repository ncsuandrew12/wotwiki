# [Interview #554: TOM Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554#7)

#### Matt Hatch

Is there a distance to pain sensitivity with the Warder bond? In essence, would I still know my Aes Sedai was being tortured or would it just be a dull pain if I was at a great distance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, distance does matter. But no, you would know that she was being tortured, even at a great distance.
