# [Interview #554: TOM Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554#6)

#### Question

Was Narg an especially smart Trolloc?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Narg was a smart Trolloc; there are other Trollocs that can speak the human tongue...we are talking the the top one percentile.

#### Footnote

Brandon probably meant the 99th percentile. Or the top 1%.
