# [Interview #554: TOM Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554#2)

#### Matt Hatch

Can someone without the Talent for Dreamwalking or Dreaming, but with access to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
through a
*ter'angreal*
be taught to find dreams?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know, no. That's an 80%.

The question they should be asking is could Perrin (be taught to find dreams)?

#### Matt Hatch

Can he?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't think so.

#### Matt Hatch

Well, what he can do is similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But the wolves don't know about them.

#### Matt Hatch

Well...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not sure, but that's what I would be asking (paraphrased).
