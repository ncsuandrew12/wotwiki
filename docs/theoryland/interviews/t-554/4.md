# [Interview #554: TOM Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554#4)

#### Matt Hatch

Is the Bore larger or smaller than it was at the time of the Sealing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The same size (95% sure).

#### Matt Hatch

So, are the seals, even in their weakened state, the reason the Bore has not grown any larger?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know, yes.
