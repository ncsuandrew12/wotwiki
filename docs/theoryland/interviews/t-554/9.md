# [Interview #554: TOM Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554#9)

#### Matt Hatch

What happened to the large packs of Darkhounds that were patrolling Altara back in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We already know, don't we?

#### Matt Hatch

Honest, can't remember.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I know, but I think we do know.

#### Footnote

Brandon is probably referring to the passage in
*Winter's Heart*
[Chapter 13](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/wh/ch13.html)
where Moridin reveals that Isam (Slayer) is hunting Fain. The connection between Slayer and the new breed of Darkhounds is not explicit, but it is still pretty obvious. Luc and Isam are mentioned in connection with the Darkhounds in the
[Dark Prophecy](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=7#10)
written on the dungeon wall in
*The Great Hunt*
[Chapter 7](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/tgh/ch7.html)
. He was killing wolves in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
in
*The Shadow Rising*
[Chapter 28](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/tsr/ch28.html)
, and the reality-bending properties of the Unseen World might explain the
[T2 Darkhounds](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=94#16)
.
