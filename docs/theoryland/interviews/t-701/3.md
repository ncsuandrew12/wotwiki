# [Interview #701: Amsterdam report - Ashley Cowles, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=701#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He didn't talk about Shards, but he did mention that it was very likely we wouldn't find out who Hoid was even in the tenth book of the Stormlight Archive. If anything, it would be in his thesis, of which at this moment only 8 copies were printed. He said he might publish it as a book at a certain point, but not right now.

#### Footnote

That thesis statement is Dragonsteel, and is at the BYU library.
