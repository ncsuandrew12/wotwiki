# [Interview #264: Robert Jordan's Blog: Photos from RJ, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=264#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Dear Jason,

Here are some pictures you can post when and as you want. Please give a photo credit line for William P. McDougal to all of the pictures except the one of three of us. That photo show my cousin Wilson, on the right, my younger brother Reynolds, in the middle, and me standing in front of a portrait of Harriet that hangs in our dining room.

The other pics are partly of me before starting the chemo and partly of me after my first chemo, after I decided not to wait for the hair to start going in patches. I went straight to the barber and told him to take it all off except the beard.
