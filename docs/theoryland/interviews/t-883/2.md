# [Interview #883: AMOL Signing Report - Lara, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=883#2)

#### Question

If there are three people, and person 1 balefires person 2, then person 3 balefires person 1, does person 2 come back to life?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon reminded the fan that when someone asked Robert Jordan this question, Mr. Jordan responded by saying the asker needed the love of a man, woman, or schnauzer of his choice. There is actually a correct answer: balefire removes a thread from the Pattern, and, once removed, that thread cannot be replaced.

#### Footnote

RJ gave
[an answer to this question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=111#2)
in Australia in 1999 that contradicts Brandon's answer here. RJ said that person 2
*would*
come back to life; this was confirmed by
[another report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=113)
at the same signing. Furthermore, there is an unattributed Q&A from
[Thus Spake the Creator](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator.htm)
in which RJ states (more specifically, perhaps) that it
[depends on the strength of the balefire](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#39)
, presumably because a very small amount would not burn person 1's thread back far enough to bring person 2 back to life. [Brandon later
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=963#4)
it was his mistake, and Maria said that the 'depends on strength' answer is probably the correct one.]

Finally, it was in response to a question about opening a gateway behind yourself and then using balefire that
[RJ told the person to get a life](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=180#6)
, not the question asked here (and he actually referred to a German Shepherd, not a schnauzer).
