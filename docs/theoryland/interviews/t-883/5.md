#### Question

There was a new weave used by someone in book 14; did anyone else see it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Yes"â€”and that's all that was spoken about it, since it contained spoilers.

#### Footnote

Presumably this is in reference to the "Flame of Tar Valon" weave, which Egwene used in
*A Memory of Light*
37.
