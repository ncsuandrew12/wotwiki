# [Interview #883: AMOL Signing Report - Lara, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=883#14)

#### Question

Either my hand was cramping up or I missed a segue, but somehow a discussion of Brandon's writing style commenced.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He stated that he works from an outline, and that Robert Jordan grew and nurtured scenes over time. Brandon did not try to imitate Robert Jordan's writing style, and left the blending of the two writing styles up to Harriet. Harriet was Tor Books' original editor, discovering Mr. Rigney and editing the two best-selling series in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Harriet was in charge of blending the voices together.
