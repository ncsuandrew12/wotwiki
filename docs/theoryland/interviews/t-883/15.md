#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet gave a shout-out to a relative of hers from Kentucky named
[Martha Bennett Stiles](http://www.marthabennettstiles.com/)
(I hope this is spelled correctly), author of the book
*Sailing to Freedom*
. The state of Kentucky chose this book to be included on the National Mall in Washington, DC.

Brandon and Harriet both thanked bookstores in general, saying that they provide a service that is difficult to find elsewhere. "Bookstores are a great treasure."â€”Harriet
