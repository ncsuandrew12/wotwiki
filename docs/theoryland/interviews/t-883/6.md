# [Interview #883: AMOL Signing Report - Lara, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=883#6)

#### Question

Did Brandon question himself when he was chosen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Apparently, Brandon was unable to sleep that night after saying yes, because he knew that he would fail. Anyone who took on this project would fail, because no one could tell the story as good as Robert Jordan would have. Brandon had only published two novels at the time, so it was a huge risk for him, and it was a risk for Harriet to ask him. However, he knew that he was a fan of the series, and that, if he didn't say yes, and it went to someone who wasn't a fan of the series and they messed it up, it would be his fault. He decided that in the Venn Diagram that consists of Wheel of Time fans in one circle, and pretty good writers in another circle, he was the person in the middle. "I'll screw it up the least," he said.
