# [Interview #883: AMOL Signing Report - Lara, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=883#12)

#### Question

Will anything be done specially for those who won the contest to have their names in the book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*The Gathering Storm*
, many fans stated that the names felt off, and Brandon agreed. Robert Jordan's character names were inspired by the real world, such as Ogier St. in Charleston, his stove, medications he was taking, etc. There had been a fundraiser for one person to have his name included in one of the books, and that was being continued. Brandon decided to increase this, and put many people in the final two books. The short answer: Nope, the name in the book is the something special.

(Note: Later, I happened to be sitting up front when the person who asked this question came to the front, with his wife and an absolutely adorable two-year-old little girl. Turns out, he had his daughter's name placed in the book instead of his own. Brandon signed the book at the place where she was mentioned.)
