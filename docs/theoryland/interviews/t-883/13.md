# [Interview #883, Entry #13]: AMOL Signing Report - Lara](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=883#13)

#### Question

What was Brandon given to start his work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He received one scene from each prologueâ€”the first scene from
*The Gathering Storm*
that was dictated, the Kandori tower scene from
*Towers of Midnight*
, and one scene from
*A Memory of Light*
that I will not state since it contains a spoiler. There were large chunks of the ending, including the entire epilogue. He received fragments of Egwene's visit from her "special visitor" in
*The Gathering Storm*
, and a proposal at the end of
*Towers of Midnight*
. There were also discussions of scenes, and answers from Team Jordan.
