# [Interview #883: AMOL Signing Report - Lara, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=883#9)

#### Question

Does he have any advice for new writers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He suggests listening to his podcast,
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
, published weekly. In addition to this, someone recorded Brandon's lectures in his writing Science Fiction and Fantasy class at BYU, and published them online at
[www.writeaboutdragons.com](http://www.writeaboutdragons.com)
. It's like taking his class.

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet's advice was to attend sci-fi conventions, which are quite frequent in this country. Editors and agents troll for talent, so attend often and collect as many business cards as you can.
