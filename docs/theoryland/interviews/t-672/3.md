# [Interview #672: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Where to buy signed copies of THE ALLOY OF LAW + Updates, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=672#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Many of the booksellers I visited during my recent tour still have signed copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
. Check my events calendar to see if I'll be near you anytime soon. If I won't be, give one of the following stores a call. (You can also
[tell me your city](http://brandonsanderson.com/contact/?topic=9)
and I'll email you when I'm visiting nearby.)

[Mysterious Galaxy](http://www.mystgalaxy.com/)
  
7051 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. Suite #302
  
San Diego, CA 92111
  
(858) 268-4747
  
Alone among the stores on this list, Mysterious Galaxy has signed copies of a lot of my other books, not just
*The Alloy of Law*
, and will ship worldwide. Give them a call.

[Murder by the Book](http://www.murderbooks.com/signed-books-m-z)
, Houston
  
2342 Bissonnet
  
Houston, TX 77005
  
(713) 524-8597
  
(888) 424-2842
  
Murder by the Book's copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
are signed not only by me but also by interior artist Ben McSweeney, who illustrated the book's newspaper broadsheet.

[Chapters Metrotown](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/home/storeLocator/storeDetails/762/?cookieCheck=1)
  
Metropolis, Metrotown 4700 Kingsway
  
Burnaby, BC V5H 4M1, Canada
  
(604) 431-0463
  
This Chapters will have your cheapest shipping option for delivery anywhere in Canada.

[Forbidden Planet](http://forbiddenplanet.com/78150-the-alloy-of-law-hardcover/)
  
179 Shaftesbury Avenue
  
WC2H 8JR London, United Kingdom
  
0207 420 3666
  
Forbidden Planet will also ship worldwide, but they're probably your best bet for getting a signed copy of
*The Alloy of Law*
in Europe. Their copies are all the UK edition of of the book. They also have some signed
*The Way of Kings*
split paperbacks:
[Part 1](http://forbiddenplanet.com/72925-stormlight-archive-book-1-the-way-of-kings-part-1/)
,
[Part 2](http://forbiddenplanet.com/72926-stormlight-archive-book-1-the-way-of-kings-part-2/)
.

I will eventually add this book to my
[website store](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/)
as well, but I won't do that until it has been on the shelf for about a year and the mass market paperback has been released already. Please support your local bookseller.
