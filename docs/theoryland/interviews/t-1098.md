## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1098#1)

#### Newan

Is the kandra worldhopper MeLaan?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Good question. \*gives Newan a RAFO card\* In upcoming Mistborn books, you are going to get to know a lot more of the kandra, so you will have a lot more options.

#### Newan

Ooh. When the kandra worldhopper is off-world, er off-Scadrial, does she take the form of a human female?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Not all of the time.

#### Newan

Has she spoken a word of dialogue in a non-Mistborn book?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

I can't remember.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1098#2)

#### Newan

Is there some kind of connection between Szeth and Yelig-nar, the Unmade?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Hmm... Szeth has no more of a connection with Yelig-nar than anyone else does.
