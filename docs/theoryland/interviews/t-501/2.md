# [Interview #501: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Gemmell Nominations, Audible Tournament, Suvudu Cage Match + Updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=501#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first round of David Gemmell Legend Award voting is over, and I was surprised to learn that
[both
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Warbreaker*
have made the short list](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfLMqsOUG5c)
(going up against
*The Cardinal's Blades*
by Pierre Pevel,
*Empire: The Legend of Sigmar*
by Graham McNeill, and
*Best Served Cold*
by Joe Abercrombie). I still feel that
*The Gathering Storm*
is a better fit for the award since it is much more in the spirit of David Gemmell's work than
*Warbreaker*
is, and I'd rather not split my fanbase's vote, but this is a fan-voted award and you (the fans) can give it to whatever book you think best deserves it. I definitely want to win that battleaxe one of these days, but I'm sure Harriet would like a battleaxe for Robert Jordan too. (As Joe, Graham, and Pierre would each like one for himself.) Voting on the final round should start fairly soon; I believe it will happen
[at this link](http://gemmellaward.com/page/vote-for-the-legend-here)
and run until sometime before the awards ceremony in June. I'll mention it again sometime after voting has begun.

*The Gathering Storm*
has also made the final round of Audible's 3rd Annual Tournament of Audiobooks where it will be up against
*The Help*
by Kathryn Stockett.
*The Help*
got 75 more votes in the semifinals than
*The Gathering Storm*
did, so TGS is going to need some . . . help . . . if you would like it to win the tournament. Voting starts here sometime Tuesday afternoon. (And here's a non-flash link.)
