# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#22)

#### Question

How do you feel about the graphic novel project?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, it's in work, and mostly Maria Simons has been working with the Dabel Brothers, who have been a joy to work with editorially. There have been some problems about the schedule, but their devotion to the work is really just what we want to see.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They're famously wonderful artists, and not so good on the business front.

#### Harriet McDougal

And I've seen a French edition of a piece of
*The Eye of the World*
, and to see Mat talking French, and saying, "
*Ah, zut alors!*
"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hey, that's a nice thing. Way in the back there, they have some of the graphic novels for sale!

#### Harriet McDougal

What a coincidence!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, what a coincidence. Ooh, someone's holding them right back there, the thing back there; you can go get some of the graphic novels, you can go through those....

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, and there's one in the front here.
