# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#27)

Alright. Now, there's a few more things we're going to do, so....no, start talking in a minute. I want to actually make a request to Harriet. Harriet, if I grab one of these books, will you read the first paragraph—just the wind paragraph, the legend thing—so that they get a little reading, among the last times that any reading will cover these paragraphs. And so, maybe just two paragraphs there, Harriet? And then we'll have some announcements.
