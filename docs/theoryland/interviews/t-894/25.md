# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#25)

#### Question

Can you tell us the two sentences about the outriggers?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well I can, but it's a spoiler. Later, I certainly will, but right now that is a spoiler, in the two sentences.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The question references the outriggers, which was a sequel trilogy that Robert Jordan had intended to write to the Wheel of Time, involving some of the characters. We can't say much about it. You can find out more online, because we don't want to give spoilers, but he only left two sentences telling us what was going to be in those, and so it's basically impossible to write them, even if we had wanted to.

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, if he hadn't expressed himself so thoroughly, that before he let other people write in his universe, he would take his hard drives and run over them with a semi three times to be sure that that didn't happen, and it's...I mean, since there was literally two sentences, it would be very much a sharecropping operationâ€”
