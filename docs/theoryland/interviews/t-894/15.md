# [Interview #894, Entry #15]: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#15)

#### Question

How are your plans for Stormlight Two doing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am trying to get done for a fall, late fall release this year. Harriet snickers at me when I say that, because she knows that the chances of that actually happening are kind of slim. It could happen. It's more likely that it would be spring the following year, but I'm going to try. I'm going to try very hard. I'm about forty percent of the way through the first draft; the problem is never first draft, though; revisions take a long time on a book this big. Rothfuss once described it as, "It's like ninety percent awesome, but you don't want to release something that's only ninety percent awesome, and that last ten percent is really hard to get to sometimes." So we'll see.

#### Harriet McDougal

And then, production on an enormous book is also very time-consuming, and the way I think of it is, there will be Gelusil on coffee carts at Tor, or other remedies for stomach upsets. They say, "You want this book by when?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tom, who runs Tor, is optimistic, though I noticed he had little stickersâ€”there's copies of
*Way of Kings*
to give out as prizes, and they have a sticker on it that says, "Watch for the sequel in late 2013."
