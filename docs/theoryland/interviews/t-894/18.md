# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#18)

#### Question

Can you still read the books and appreciate them after The Wheel of Time being your job for so long?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I still read Jim's—Robert Jordan's books—and enjoy them, and I just recently picked up one and started reading through it. I don't reread my own books usually unless it's to reacquaint myself with certain things so that I can work on a sequel, because I will simply find too many things I want to change. This is the artist's dilemma; you've got to let it be done; you can't go back and continually tweak and revise and rewrite. At some point is just has to stand as a work of art, and reading your own books again...it's too dangerous for me to do that. So I don't reread mine, so I've never reread
*Gathering Storm*
, for instance. Now, I did read it fourteen times while we were revising it [laughter], so I do know that book pretty darn well, but I haven't reread it since.
