#### Question

What’s your favorite part of the creative process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm gonna say...[audio cut]...is the ending, writing the last sequences that I've been planning so long—because I always know what my ending is, and I tend to point everything at the ending—writing that last sequence is my favorite. For instance, my favorite scene to write in
*A Memory of Light*
comes right near the end. There's a very long chapter that you'll read; it's the last part of that very long chapter, into the next chapter which is very short. (something from audience) Yeah, it's 200-something pages.

#### Harriet McDougal

For good reason.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, for good reasons.
