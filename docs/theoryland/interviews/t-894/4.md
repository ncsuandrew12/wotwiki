# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#4)

#### Question

As a fan of the series, what was your initial reaction when you were first asked to write this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dumbfounded stupefaction. I didn't know Harriet was considering me, and when she called—and I could barely speak—in fact, I wrote her an email the next day that said basically, "Dear Harriet, I promise I'm not an idiot; I'm sorry I couldn't talk yesterday." [laughter] So yeah, just complete and utter shock.
