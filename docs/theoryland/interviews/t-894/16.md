# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#16)

#### Question

Which character will you miss writing the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s an interesting question, because usually people ask me my favorite character which is easy, because it's Perrin, and always has been Perrin. But, miss writing the most? I’m actually going to say Mat, because Mat was one of the ones I struggled with to get right, and Mat for me was an evolution between
*Gathering Storm*
,
*Towers of Midnight*
, and finally this book when I feel like I finally
*got*
Mat, like I really understood him, if that makes sense. And in this one, I finally got down the mix of incorrigible silliness and complete awesomeness that is Mat. It's a really hard dichotomy to get right. And so I'm going to miss Mat because it's something I finally got good at, I feel, whereas I started good with Perrin. Perrin's always made sense to me. So there you go.
