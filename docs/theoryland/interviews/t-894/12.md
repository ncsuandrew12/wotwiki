# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#12)

#### Question

Has it gotten any easier to dig through RJ’s very personalized and, in some ways, maddeningly genius organizational system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You’d actually have to ask that of Maria and Alan since they are the ones who dig through it. I gave up on that after about two months into the first book because I couldn't make heads or tails of it; I just started asking questions of them. It still takes a long time sometimes to get responses, not because they're not working but because it's hard to find, so I don't know that it's gotten that much better.
