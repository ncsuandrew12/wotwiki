# [Interview #894: AMOL Book Tour - Dayton Q&A, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=894#2)

#### Question

Where did the idea for the zombies come from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Are you speaking of Hinderstap? (Questioner explains further.) ...Yes you're speaking of Hinsderstap. Hinderstap came out of working with bubbles of evil and things like this, and Harriet saying to me at one point, "The book’s not creepy enough." [laughter] She said, "Go read..."—she gave me the scene with the dead rat from early—is it
*Eye of the World*
, that has that scene, where they're in the dreams, and things?—she's like, "Get me some more creepy. It's supposed to be getting worse and worse." And so I'm like, "Alright, creepy it is." And that was where it came from.

#### Harriet McDougal

Thus is the nature of inspiration.
