Just got back from the Seattle signing. First off, I want to say that Brandon is really super cool; just a nice, personable guy. First and foremost the guy is just a fan.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He even said that the best part of being done with writing WoT is that he can go back to being a fan; discussing and theorizing with others, something he felt he couldn't do while still writing the books. He said that he can finally start talking to other people about the end of the series.

The best part of the night? My nine year old daughter got to fist bump Brandon when we got to the signing table. How cool is that?

The event went pretty much the same as the others described earlier, with pretty much the same questions being asked. Harriet was also there and read the "Wind" paragragh after the Q & A period.

I got to meet and talk with both Wetlandernw (who was dressed like Cadsuane, natch) and JeffS (who gave my daughter a "Bela is a darkfriend" bumpersticker for being there) who were both MKs.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

While getting my books signed I asked Brandon how many books he had written before
*Elantris*
and he said seven, not all of which were epic fantasy. He also said that that number had risen to thirteen books by the time
*Elantris*
was published, making
*Mistborn*
the fourteenth book he had written.

All in all, a very enjoyable evening. I'm so glad I took the night off from work to go.
