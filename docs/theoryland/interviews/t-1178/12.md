#### Question

If you tapped blank Identity in an area, would you develop the area's accent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's part of what you need. You need to both blank your Identity and tap Connection to get the accent.

#### Footnote

Note: Sanderson interpreted this question as blanking identity. Also, I don't think tapping blank identity is a thing, so it was not a great question.
