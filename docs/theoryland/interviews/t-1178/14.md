# [Interview #1178: Old Firehouse Books-AU tour, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1178#14)

#### Question

If you were on Roshar, and tapped Connection, would you be unable to use Scadrial magic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but that's a good question. You would not be able to use Selish magic though, because that is dependent on location.
