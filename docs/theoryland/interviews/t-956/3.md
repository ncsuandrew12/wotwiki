# [Interview #956: AMOL Signing Report - TheOneKEA, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=956#3)

#### TheOneKEA

I also referenced the recent Q&A and
[this post](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/2383-qa-with-brandon-sanderson/page__st__60__p__42119#entry42119)
, and speculated that the reason why the original poster thought Wax's sister was a duralumin ferring was because of Wax's comment that he did not feel any strong emotions as a result of her death. I told Brandon that the poster must have thought that she was deliberately suppressing her Connection with Wax by using Feruchemy.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I said that I didn't need a yes or no answer from him, and he replied that he would neither confirm nor deny my statement and would only agree that it was very interesting.
