# [Interview #842: Waldenbooks Hailing Frequency Interview, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=842#3)

#### Hailing Frequency

How far do you attempt to make the individual volumes accessible to someone who's coming in fresh? Or is that a lost cause?

#### Robert Jordan

I think it's a lost cause. From the beginning, I've told people, "Start with
*The Eye of the World*
." If somebody tries to join at Book Six, there's a good chance they'll say, "Well, there's a lot of stuff here I didn't understand. I don't think I'll bother with this." While if they start with Book One, there's a very good chance they'll continue, and come back for more. I tell people, "Go buy
*The Eye of the World*
in paperback. You haven't invested a lot of money. If you don't like it you can quit. At least you're giving yourself a chance to enjoy it."
