# [Interview #842: Waldenbooks Hailing Frequency Interview, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=842#4)

#### Hailing Frequency

The number of projected volumes has gradually grown as the story has progressed...

#### Robert Jordan

Well, in a way yes, in a way no. When I went to my publisher in the first place, I said, "This is at least three or four books. It could be five or six. I don't know." I knew it was going to be long, but I didn't know how long it was going to be. I'm always optimistic about how much story I can cram into a certain number of pages. So we did a six-book contract. At first people were saying this would be a trilogy, and I'd say "No, no, no." But people kept saying that. And by the time the fourth book came out, people admitted that it wasn't going to be a trilogy. It's going to be more than eight books. I'm a lot closer to the end than to the beginning; there's not anywhere near the same number of books to come. But I refuse to suggest even a number now.

#### Hailing Frequency

Working on a series of this lengthâ€”it's more like a singe story broken into book-length segments.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, and in each book, I do try to provide a climactic closure that is satisfying.
