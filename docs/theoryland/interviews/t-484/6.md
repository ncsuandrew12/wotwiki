#### David Lenberg

Yep, Brandon, thank you. Is it correct that there are two more books to come and complete the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Robert Jordan left. . . he'd been promising people a dramatic conclusion of around 2500 pages, which is unbindably large as one volume. And so, what we have in
*The Gathering Storm*
is me covering about a third of the notes that he left behind. It is a complete story in itself, it doesn't just stop in the middle. But I chose certain plot arcs and certain things that needed to be cleared up or needed to be dealt with before we could move on toward the ending. And I'm doing that and a volume that will hopefully come out by the end of next year called
*Towers of Midnight*
. And then there will be one concluding volume.

#### David Lenberg

Wow. Sounds great. Now what happens to a reader and fan like myself who hasn't read any of the Wheel of Time? Can I just pick up
*The Gathering Storm*
and jump right in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, you know it's going to be a really challenging read for you if you do. I have known people who've done it. They say that the first half of the book is incredibly confusing, but by the second half they start to pick it up. I would recommend that people go to
*The Eye of the World*
, which is the first book in the series. I can wholeheartedly endorse these books, I've loved them for so long. But I think that if you're going to read mine, you probably want to start with
*The Eye of the World*
.

#### David Lenberg

Sure, sure. So that's the first book in the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is the first book in the series, yes.
