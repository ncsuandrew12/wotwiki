# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#12)

#### Question

Why was the infant Isam spared death at the hand of the Trollocs?

#### Robert Jordan

Possible political use later. You've got somebody who is related to the royal family of Malkier and you can raise him exactly the way you want, you can instill whatever belief system you want. He's a blank slate and he might be a very powerful tool.

#### Question

Was Isam raised by the Shadow directly, by his mother, or by someone else?

#### Robert Jordan

By someone else. Read and find out.
