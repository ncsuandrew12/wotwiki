#### Question

Why did turning the Tar Valon harbor chains to
*cuendillar*
help? You would think a chain made of
*cuendillar*
would be flexible because it is in separate pieces.

#### Robert Jordan

No, as I showed you in one of the scenes where they are learning to make
*cuendillar*
. They had two items touch each other when they were turning it into
*cuendillar*
and they fused to one another, so what you have is a series of chains where each link is fused to the next, so in essence what you have is one solid piece of
*cuendillar*
.
