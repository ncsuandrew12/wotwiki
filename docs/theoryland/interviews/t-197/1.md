# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#1)

#### Isabel

Second day at Dragon Con

The night on Friday till Saturday I only got four hours sleep, because of transcribing the whole report and thinking about what to ask RJ. This morning I got help from a fellow Theorylander called WSB. That's why you have the whole picture. Now Tamyrlin is typing out all the question and answers from today. RJ answered a lot!

So here is the transcript. It's ten pages long and you have to thank Tamyrlin for typing it all out (but it was my tape recorder).
