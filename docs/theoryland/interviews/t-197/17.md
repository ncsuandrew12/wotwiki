# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#17)

#### Matt Hatch

Skipped [transcription of]: A question about how Nynaeve knew about the
*ki'sain*
custom.

#### Robert Jordan

...To which Jordan then goes into a discourse on male and female relationships, which was funny, about women seeing men like peeling an onion, and men being goldfish that need to keep flopping so women don't walk away, by preserving secrets, not forever, but enough that may be upsetting that just when she thinks she knows you, such a secret is revealed, and she then realizes there anyway, you had to be there.

#### Isabel

Isa here, I will make a transcript about this. It's a question from the Official Nynaeve Fanclub and I want the full words here.
