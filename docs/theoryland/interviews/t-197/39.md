# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#39)

#### Question

I have a question about the Nine Rods of Dominion. We have a couple of references to this, and Ishamael says that Lews Therin summoned the Nine Rods of Dominion. And theories have been floating around, are the Oath Rods not the Nine Rods of Dominion?

#### Robert Jordan

They were not the Oath Rods.

#### Question

Well are they positions of power, were they people, or were they actual rods?

#### Robert Jordan

They were actual people, and they were, but you might call them regional governors of the earth, regional governors of the planet. So if I say, summon them, then we've got a guy who has been given in effect ultimate power.
