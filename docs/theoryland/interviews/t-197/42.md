# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#42)

#### Matt Hatch

I'm trying to verify Rand's impression he has at the end of book four, regarding the connection he cuts of Asmodean to the Dark One. He seemed to believe it was the connection directly from that individual to the Dark One. So what I am wondering is, is that connection key to transmigration?

#### Robert Jordan

No, because what you are thinking of wasn't a connection; Rand thought it was.
