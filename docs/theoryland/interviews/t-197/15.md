#### Sara

When out of the three thousand year sleep, were the Forsaken still wearing the clothes from the time they were imprisoned?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, they were.

#### Sara

How does the process of waking up work, and were they conscious of it happening to them and or the other Forsaken?

#### Robert Jordan

They were conscious of waking up, but remember that Lanfear said they were in a sleep so deep they were trapped so deep, that they were denied even dreams. Most of them were in fact in suspended animation. Balthamel and Aginor, very close to the surface, were not, which is why they were so wasted when they are seen, and why they have a certain degree of madness as well. The others came out unaged, looking exactly as they did, but Aginor and Balthamel although wearing the clothes they wore, and the mask was an original he was wearing it when he went in, they were further wasted, you might say, preserved by being sealed in the Bore, but close enough to the surface that they were aware of things going on outside.
