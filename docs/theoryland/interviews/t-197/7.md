#### Isabel

[What is the length of] the next book,
*Knife of Dreams*
, in comparison to the other books?

#### Robert Jordan

I would say it is the same length as
*Winter's Heart*
, perhaps a little longer. Hello, Isabel. I still don't see that note from your mother allowing you to be here. Isabel is only twelve, don't believe what she says, she is only twelve.

#### Isabel

Hehe, so funny, but sorry for this question. I posted this question before we got the information from Dragonmount about the length of the book.
