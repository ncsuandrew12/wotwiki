#### Question

In the Age of Legends, the soldiers used shocklances. Were they projectile or energy weapons?

#### Robert Jordan

Think of it as an energy weapon. Remember, by the time we get to the Breaking, shocklances are actually in fairly short supply and other devices of that sort. Long before we get to the breaking the industrial base has been enough destroyed that soldiers are once again using bows and spears and swords because there simply aren't enough shocklances to go around, nor jo-cars and there is no industrial base to provide replacement for them.
