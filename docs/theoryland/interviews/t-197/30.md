# [Interview #197, Entry #30]: DragonCon Report - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#30)

#### Question

Ishamael mentions in prior turnings of the Wheel that the soul of Lews Therin was raised up as the Shadow's champion, and if that is the case, who was the champion of the Creator?

#### Robert Jordan

You believe Ishamael??? Sorry, man, but c'mon!

#### Footnote

RJ effectively answered this question twice in 2003: 1)
[for tarvalon.net](#3)
, and 2)
[for Tim Kington](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#27)
on the
*Crossroads of Twilight*
book tour. The first version of the question (which clearly refers to Rand, as Ishamael was talking about Rand, and RJ said Ishamael did not lie) seems to contradict this one, but it doesn't, really. RJ does not say here explicitly that Ishamael lied, so it seems that he was avoiding the question of who would be the Champion of the Light if Rand turned. He could hardly say RAFO without leading the reader to believe that Rand would be somehow turned to the Shadow before the end.
