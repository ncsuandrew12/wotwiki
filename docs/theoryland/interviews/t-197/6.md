# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#6)

#### Question

Would you please name one character who did not kill Asmodean? Will you please name one of the following: Lanfear, Graendal, Moridin, Shaidar Haran, Padan Fain, Semirhage, Demandred, Mazrim Taim, Slayer. I thank you for your mercy and if you can please explain why they didn't do it that would be a nice touch.

#### Robert Jordan

Padan Fain didn't because he wasn't in the right place at the right time. He would have if he had been in the right place at the right time, but he wasn't.

#### Isabel

This is a question from Theoryland, at least that's what I remember. Ouch, and there I was thinking yesterday we had finally a case for Fain. He should stop with ruling out every character. I am still not going for Graendal. Sorry, don't see it. And I use almost the same quotes other people use to prove Graendal did it, to prove she didn't do it.
