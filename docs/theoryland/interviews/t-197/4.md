# [Interview #197: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=197#4)

#### Question

Have any of the members of your fandom affected your writing? For example have any of the latter minor characters been reflections or poked fun of anything you have read?

#### Robert Jordan

No, no, I don't believe in poking fun at my fans. (Tells a short story about using a name or two from individuals he has met. He mentions a couple of Aes Sedai names, missing Aes Sedai, from names of some fans who sent a letter to him without a return address.)
