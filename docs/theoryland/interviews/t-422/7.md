#### Damon Cap

This is going to be a little bit of a morbid question, but if you were going to start this large epic, who would you say now you would want to finish it up based on your notes? If you had the chance, in this day and age...

#### Brandon Sanderson

OK. Who am I going to give it to? If I kick the bucket, give it to Patrick Rothfuss. He'll probably be too busy, but I think he would do a great job. Let's see... Who else would I give the book to...? Well. Let's see. Oh, I know his name. Shadow in Summer...

#### DAMON CAP

Daniel...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Daniel Abraham. I like Daniel Abraham's writing a lot. He hasn't done the big, massive books, but I think he would do it justice.

#### DAMON CAP

That's pretty fair.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah. There you go. One of those two guys.
