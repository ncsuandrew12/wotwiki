# [Interview #422: Book Expo America Interview, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=422#9)

#### Damon Cap

I know that we've talked about what the Dabel Brothers are doing, the comic book adaptation...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I just picked up a couple of them myself. They look gorgeous.

#### DAMON CAP

Yeah, they did look really good. Is it more of a Harriet thing? I know we're also talking about the movie itself. Are you involved in that, have they been coming to you and asking you your opinion on things, or is that more of a Harriet...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That's been mostly Maria. Maria's been handling that. Maria is the continuity expert on staff. And so she's been handling that. I suspect they will come to me when they reach these books more. But I've been so busy, that really it's been her and Jason from Dragonmount that have been consulting on those. And I've just not wanted to stick my nose into it because I've got so much on my plate already with these books. So that's mostly Maria. So if you want to ask about those, interview Maria.
