# [Interview #657: Elf Fantasy Fair - Myranya, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=657#2)

#### Myranya

There is one thing I learned from RJ's tour in the Netherlands. I never believed Sheriam was a Black by choice, but I used to consider her being turned to the Shadow as a valid option. Perhaps that would leave her not completely willing to find out as much as she could (letting Siuan do a lot of the work). Also, since she was the one who told Egwene about the turning being possible, she would be a prime candidate plot-wise. Yet
[one question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=135#38)
asked at an online chat held while he was here...Unless RJ is
*really*
trying to throw us off (which is possible ::grin::), this means that he hasn't used it yet, not turning anyone 'off-screen'. For now, I'm convinced Sheriam isn't a Black at allâ€”voluntary or involuntary. :)
