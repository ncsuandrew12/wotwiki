# [Interview #657: Elf Fantasy Fair - Myranya, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=657#1)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked what happened to [Sheriam's] Warder at Elf Fantasy, and got a RAFO, as I'd pretty much expected, but I had to try :) I asked "I know this is probably going to be a RAFO, but I really wonder if you forgot about him." RJ did laugh and almost seemed to hesitate as he answered, but I don't know if that meant that he did forget about that one small appearance in
*The Fires of Heaven*
when he wrote the
*Path of Daggers*
scene, or maybe it was because I admitted I kinda expected RAFO, or what.
