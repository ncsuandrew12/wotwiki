Now, the world you created is filled with very complex politics, and much of the work reads almost like a political thriller. How do politics in the real world affect your portrayal of politics in the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I'm not certain I can actually point at anything and say, "That has affected this." I have lived through my own time, so of course what's happened affects what I write. I don't think it is possible for any writer to filter his or her times—his or her
*life*
—out of what he or she writes. And that's awfully damned awkward; I'm going to stop using 'he or she', if you don't mind.

#### Rick Kleffel

Absolutely.
