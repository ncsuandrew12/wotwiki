#### Rick Kleffel

Now, your books are described as fantasy, even by you, but they don't really read like what usually falls under that label.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I'm not sure what usually falls under that label. I suppose you mean great fire-breathing dragons, or something, or damsels in distress. The problem is, of course, there are a lot of things that are fantasy that aren't called fantasy. You know, A.S. Byatt writes fantasy, and so does Doris Lessing. The magic realists are
*all*
fantasists. But, if you have ghosts, if you have ESP, if you have anything that is unreal, and unscientific, you're writing fantasy. But if you want to stay out of the ghetto—if you're afraid of that word 'fantasy'; you think, 'Aw, they slapped that word on me, I gotta be tarred, ah, never get out of it, never, never escape it,'—then you say that you're writing 'magic realism', or you're writing something else, that you are writing 'a novel', with perhaps a few....ahem, '
*fabulist*
'—"'Fabulist', yes, that's a good one; we'll call them 'fabulist' elements..."—Well,
*I*
write fantasy.

#### Rick Kleffel

That's great.
