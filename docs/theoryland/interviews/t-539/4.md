Finally,
[InkWing Arts](http://store.inkwing.com/)
, the store started by Mistborn and Stormlight Archive artist Isaac Stewart for merchandise based on those series, is having a drawing for a free T-shirt. If you saw me on the
*The Way of Kings*
tour you may have seen me in one of the T-shirts or received an Epic Bookmark. Anyway, it's all pretty cool stuff and Isaac's designs are great. Check it out.
