#### Brandon Sanderson

In other news, I've posted a couple more annotations for
*Warbreaker*
. First I talk about the
[God King's arrival at the Court of Gods](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/391/Warbreaker-Chapter-Fifteen)
. Then I discuss the
[life-sense aspect of the magic system](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/392/Warbreaker-Chapter-Fifteen-Part-2)
.

We've got two new things up for you on the Writing Excuses podcast site. First is the newest episode on
[creating suspense](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/09/26/)
. Next Dan, Howard, and I recorded
[an acceptance speech for our Parsec Award](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/09/28/)
. Once again we missed the awards ceremony, though Dan and I were both there at Dragon\*Con . . . (And don't worry about the way I sound; my voice has since recovered.)
