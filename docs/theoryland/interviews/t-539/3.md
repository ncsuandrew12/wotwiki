#### Brandon Sanderson

There's been some Wheel of Time news I haven't mentioned here. First, two early reviews of
*Towers of Midnight*
have gone up, from
[Leigh Butler on Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/09/the-wheel-of-time-towers-of-midnight-advance-review)
and
[Jason on Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/tom/i-have-read-towers-of-midnight-r36)
. And today I received
[proof covers from Tor](http://twitpic.com/2sw661)
. The book comes out in a mere 34 days. Are you ready? My tour schedule is on my site, along with a few conventions I'll be attending later. Oh, and the paperback and ebook versions of
[*The Gathering Storm*](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/store/item/38/The-Gathering-Storm)
came out today.
