Also, I wanted to say thanks to Paul for the invitation to do this. I appreciate the welcome!

Others, feel free to still post in this thread (unless Paul decides it should be locked). I'll still read your replies and comments if they're here, I just won't be able to respond. (Except for the questions asked above, which—as I noted—I'll keep working through.)
