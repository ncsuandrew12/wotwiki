# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#19)

#### Vicc

Could you tell us, if you know, whether the Prologue of
*The Gathering Storm*
is going to be published early? It was for the last three books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really wish I could give you something firm on this. I know it was done previously, and I've asked for it to be done againâ€”just because so many people want to see it. But there's a big time crunch on this book, and I don't know if Tor can spare the energy for this right now. We'll see. I'll ask again.
