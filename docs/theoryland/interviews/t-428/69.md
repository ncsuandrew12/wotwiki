# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#69)

She (and I) would also like to know more details of the Mistborn movie. The last she heard, you'd rejected it being a TV series. So, yeah. Any more details?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Did a big post on this
[just above](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#60)
. I think that will answer the request for details.

Note that I rejected the tv series not because of the idea of doing a tv series itself, but because I wasn't confident in the production studio who was making the offer. More details will come once contracts are signed.
