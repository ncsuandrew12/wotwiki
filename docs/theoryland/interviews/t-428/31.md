# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#31)

When it comes to crazy plot twists, fascinating characters, magic systems, humor, religion, etc., what do you feel, for you, is the hardest part to get on paper or come up with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that the most difficult parts have to do with getting a character's internal conflicts (if they have them) right. Sometimes, this can take a lot of exploration. Sazed in Mistborn 3 took a LOT of work before I was satisfied.

Second hardest is getting the humor right, particularly witty style humor like in the Lightsong sections of
*Warbreaker*
. There are frequently times when I spend hours on a single line in sections like that.

By the way, all of your work is pure Awesomeness!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks! I try my best to avoid watered-down awesomeness, if only because of the aftertaste. ;)
