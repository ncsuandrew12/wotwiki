# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#18)

Next, I've been hearing about
*The Way of Kings*
series you are starting. Are you planning to have that as a single book or going to try and make it a trilogy like Mistborn or a large ten or more book series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's going to be a big series. No promises on length right now, but I feel that it is going to be long. I have 10 books plotted right now, though some of those might get combinedâ€”essentially, there are 10 plot arcs I want to cover. But expect it to be big. The first book is done, and came in at 380,000 words before editing.
