# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #87](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#87)

#### Rachykaych

I've just read
*Warbreaker*
twice now and really enjoyed it both times.

I read that although you've planned another book in the
*Warbreaker*
world you're not certain of when you can begin writing it. As it is the only book of yours that I've read to date, I've had to skip some of your answers to other questions that contain spoilers for your other book One thing I noticed in my skimming was that the character Hoid has turned up in other books of yours.

He's very intriguing and at one point I thought he might be Vasher in disguise. Is he a Returned or is he not constrained by the magical construct?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, he's certainly not Vasher in disguise. Keep an eye out for him in other books of mine you read. He's constrained by magic like everyone else, but he has some extra experience, so to speak.
