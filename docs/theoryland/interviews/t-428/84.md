# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #84](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#84)

#### Chaos2651

In the days of the Final Empire, how does one acquire a Kandra Contract? It's not like they can just walk up to their hidden Homeland and ask for their services.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Same way you would go about hiring an assassin. Secretly, using contacts who have used them before. You have to be in the know and well-connected, either with the upper-class or the underground.
