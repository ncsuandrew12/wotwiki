# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #50](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#50)

Is it possible that there could be more than four
*Alcatraz*
books, or will the story conclude there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I pitched the series at six books, but only signed on for four at first. And so, while I'll be fulfilling my four book contract (happily) I don't know that I'll have time to write an
*Alcatraz*
book in 2010 (for 2011 release). I may have to let it stop at four for now, as to not take time away from the Wheel of Time. We'll see how I feel once I've finished all three of those, and we'll see how interested readers are in the books. But there's certainly a possibility.
