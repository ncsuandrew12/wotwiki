# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#13)

#### Liago

Paul recently wrote an article about loving maps in stories and it inspired these questions from me.

How do you come up with and create the maps for your novels? Is it a process of thought while creating the story itself or does it come later once you've written the story as a means to depict the places you've written about? Also do you scetch them yourself before having them drawn or is the process usually entirely done by a separate artist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I usually sketch myself out something vague to use as reference, then make it more and more detailed as I work through the book. At that point, I approach and artist and have them help me come up with a good visual style for the book and the map. If it's an artist I know well, I can sometimes let them do more of the workâ€”the Mistborn maps, for instance, were developed by Isaac with very little input from me beyond the text and some basic instructions.
