# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#65)

If you were going to write a novel in a genre other than scifi/fantasy which genre do you think that you would write in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmm... Perhaps a historical. Something I could really sink my teeth into. I could also see myself writing a mystery or a thriller.

The thing is, unless I'm under some kind of restriction, I know that any of those three would probably end up having fantasy or sf elements. It's just how I think.

#### iwinUlose2

Have you ever considered writing a non-fiction book based of
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have indeed considered it. We'll see. I guess it depends on how much interest there is.
