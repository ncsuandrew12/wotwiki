# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#8)

Who or what was your inspiration to start writing fantasy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I was 14, I discovered the fantasy genre through Barbara Hambly's
*Dragonsbane*
. After her, I read McCaffrey and Rawn. They are really the ones who inspired me to start. When Robert Jordan's books came along, I was done for. ;)

Which of your books is your favorite?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tough call. Right now,
*Warbreaker*
is the best written—though
*The Gathering Storm*
is better, I think. I think that
*The Way of Kings*
will be awesome too. But you didn't ask for the best, you asked for my favorite. In that case, I'd probably have to say
*Elantris*
, as it was my first.

Which of your characters is your favorite?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tie between Lightsong and Vin.

#### carmen22

Were books a natural part of your childhood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Unlike a lot of writers, I wasn't a big reader when I was younger. I came to it late, when I was in eighth grade. Until then, none of the books (mostly ones about boys with pet dogs) that people had given me worked. And then I discovered fantasy. From then on, you never found me without a book. Often two or three.

#### carmen22

And do you have a favorite book or author?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right now, Pratchett is my favorite living author. Jordan was my favorite for a long, long time. I'd add the original three ladies—McCaffrey, Rawn, and Hambly—to that as well, as they were the ones to get me into this genre.
