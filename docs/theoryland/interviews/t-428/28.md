# [Interview #428, Entry #28]: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#28)

#### MarlonRand

Also, how did the experiment with
*Warbreaker*
turn out, and are you planning to do this with any other things you write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's so hard to tell, sales-wise, how it helped or hurt. I don't, honestly, think it hurtâ€”and I think it could only have helped, as more and more WoT readers turned their eyes on me and were able to grab a book to read for free. I do plan to do it again in the future, most likely with the
*Warbreaker*
sequel.
