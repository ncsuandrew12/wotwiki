# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #71](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#71)

If the gang from
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
were put in a horror film, obviously Dan would be the killer. But what order do you think everyone would die in? And how would they die? (The victim list includes: you, Howard, Jordan, Pemberly, Stacy, and Peter.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha! Well, let's see. If Dan were the killer, I think he'd try to take out Howard first, since Howard is obviously the most dangerous of us all. Though he sees me more often, so he might try to get to me first. I'd put it in this order:

> Howard
>   
> Me
>   
> Jordo
>   
> Peter
>   
> Pemberly (he'd leave the women for last because he's a very gentlemanly killer.)

And then Stacy would take Dan down in a surprise ending. She'd edit him out of the script or something.
