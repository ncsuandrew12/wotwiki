# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#64)

I'm feeling a little bewildered; I keep seeing references to "Hoid" throughout these boards and the twitter page, and I'm assuming this is a character who makes a short appearance in each book. If so, is there an actual story going on with him, or was he just someone put in as a sort of "Easter egg"?

I think I've covered this in responses I gave before getting to your question. My forums have a lot more information. (And a lot of guesses.)
