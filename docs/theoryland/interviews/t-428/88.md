# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #88](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#88)

#### Rachykaych

Also I wondered whether you will ever publish an encyclopedia of your interlocking worlds and their relationship to each other within their cosmos?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I plan to do something like this, as things progress. It won't happen until the future, however, and will likely happen only on-line. There will eventually be short stories showing some of what is going on behind the main stories of the novels. I do have some novels planned which would deal with all of this in a more direct way, but they are decades away from being written.
