Brandon:

A huge "thank you" from me and everyone on the forum. Wow. So much information here! I know you've spent way more time here than you expected and, believe me, we all appreciate it!

Good luck with everythingâ€”
*A Memory of Light*
,
*The Way of Kings*
, etc. Know that we will be featuring all of these books when they are released!

Thanks again!

Paul
