# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #78](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#78)

Which is your favorite Pratchett novel and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Truth*
is my favorite. As a writer, and one who likes to explore the nature of the truth in his works, a novel that deals with someone trying to publish a newspaper in a fantasy world mixed philosophy and laughs in the way only Pratchett can. However,
*Guards Guards*
is the book where I suggest people new to Pratchett start. (I suggest avoiding the
*Colour of Magic*
as your first experience, even though it's technically the first book in the series. They are all stand alone novels, really, and
*Guards Guards*
can be seen as the beginning of the best sub-series within the series.)
