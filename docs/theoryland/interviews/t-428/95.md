# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #95](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#95)

#### Aldoth

A bit left of center question. Are you a role player? I ask because on Writing Excuses I think I heard you mention it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I am a role player. Have been since I discovered the TMNT RPG back when I was a young teen, and have been doing it pretty much ever since. When I play, Iâ€™m almost always some kind of magic user (duh). When I GM, I prefer to homebrew my own system.
