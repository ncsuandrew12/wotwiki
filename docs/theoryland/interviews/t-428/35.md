# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#35)

#### Brandon Sanderson

And...wow. These forum pages are pretty long, aren't they? I originally looked in and thought "Three pages? I can do that pretty quickly." And then, I realized they kind of go on, and on, and on....

I'm supposed to be here through tomorrow, but I'll probably keep accepting questions until tomorrow evening, then make a post that 'ends' the submission phase of the process. Then I'll slowly work through the questions that were posted before then. That's going to be enough work that I don't think I'll have a chance to say anything on the other thread(s) about my books specifically, so if you want something answered there, move them over to this thread. (If you don't mind.)
