# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#30)

#### iyer5

Just one question, though I'm expecting a RAFO: Will the White Tower, the physical structure itself, be destroyed at the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
or any other point in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sorry, but...well, RAFO. I'm under contract not to give things like this away.

We do know that Egwene has foreseen a strike by the Seanchan on the White Tower. We don't know how this will happen, though, or even if she's interpreting things correctly.
