# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #56](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#56)

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Is
*The Way of Kings*
your biggest work planned or do you have something on the shelf that's bigger?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well...depends.
*Dragonsteel*
is plotted at seven books. And I plan two more trilogies, eventually, in the Mistborn world. But
*Kings*
was always planned and plotted to be the big war epic, focusing on large numbers of characters across a large number of books. Mistborn will span hundreds and hundreds of years, though, so it could be 'bigger' by some definitions.
*Dragonsteel*
also is in the running, but for reasons I can't really explain without giving away things I don't want to.
