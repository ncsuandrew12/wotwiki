# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #53](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#53)

#### Raven\_Lunatic

First of all, I want to say how awesome your books are. The Mistborn series, in particular, is on my list of "best fantasy books ever read".

Now my question: is
*Warbreaker*
going to be the start of a series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've talked about the sequel. I wouldn't call it a series, though, since I'm only intending it to be two books. I actually plotted it at one, then during drafting decided that some of the things I wanted to do would be better in a sequel, and started calling it a two-book series. Tor signed me for two, and have put the second one on infinite hiatus, allowing me to turn it in whenever I want.
