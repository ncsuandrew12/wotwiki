# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#42)

Do you know when we'll start seeing
*The Way of Kings*
? Sample chapters in particular. This series sounds freaking amazing and I can't wait to see more of it. So, yeah..now that the first draft is finished (congratulations, by the way), I'm quite curious...

#### Brandon Sanderson

My plan is to start releasing sample chapters of
*Kings*
next year sometime in the spring. Not too close to draw any attention away from the release of
*The Gathering Storm*
, but far enough ahead of the
*Kings*
launch to give a good preview. February, perhaps? If you don't see them by then, I officially give you permission to send my assistant a reminder email to 'poke' me into doing it.
