# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#29)

Finally, do you have any advice for people that would like to write for a living?

#### Brandon Sanderson

First and foremost, don't give up. It can take a while. It takes time to master anythingâ€”whether it be writing, playing the piano, or brain surgery. People are willing to dedicate eight years or more to becoming a doctor. If you really want to be a writer, you need to be willing to dedicate the same amount of time and effort. Practice. Practice some more. Write a book, then write another, then write another. (I didn't sell my first, or my second, or my fifth.
*Elantris*
was my sixth book.)

Secondly, write what you love. Don't try and guess the market. Read the type of books you want to write, pay attention to what they do, and decide what it is you want to say and how you will add to the discussion. What makes your additions to the conversation unique? Write it because you feel it inside of you, not because it's what seems to be hot right now.

Finally, if I may make a plug, hop over to

and listen to me and the others on our writing podcast talk about this sort of thing. ;)
