# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #57](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#57)

#### Joshua\_Patrao

The Eternal Question: Mac or PC?

#### Brandon Sanderson

PC. Not out of any avid devotion, but because it's what I've grown up on. My wife is a Mac person, though.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Your word processor of choice?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Word. Same reason as above.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Do you have music on real loud when you write (I've heard Steve King writes like that) or is it soft in the background?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Soft in the background.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Your favorite movies?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Gattica*
.
*The Fifth Element*
, actually, is up there too.
*The Prisoner of Azkaban*
movie.
*Empire Strikes Back*
.
*Sneakers*
. Jackie Chan's
*Operation Condor*
. (I know, I know.)
*The Emperor's New Groove*
.
*Star Trek: First Contact*
.

To be honest, that's probably not a great list. Those are the movies I watch over and over, but there are a lot of movies I love, but have only seen a few times. I'm not generally a 'watch it over again' type of guy, so it's hard to pick favorites. I come back to the genre films or things like Jackie Chan because they're quirky and rewatchable, but that doesn't actually mean they're my favoriteâ€”or that they've influenced me as much as other films. For instance,
*Lawrence of Arabia*
blew my mind, and
*The Sting*
influenced how I write quite a bit. But I've only ever seen those films once. But I do keep coming back to
*Gattica*
as one of the movies I think does what storytelling should do, when done perfectly right.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Your favorite music?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on the month. Right now? Daft Punk. Before that? Anything by Harry Gregson Williams. (Often, his music is better than the film it is in.) Metallica has been a long-standing favorite of mine, though I've been listening to a lot of Desprez lately.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

I'd also like to thank Brandon here for being so wonderfully accessible. It's an excellent gesture Brandon, great of you. Your fans will always love you for it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No problem! Though that list above made me work. (Wipes brow.) I'm terrible at the "What's your favorite..." type questions.
