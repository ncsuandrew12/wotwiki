# [Interview #428, Entry #90]: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#90)

#### Nikleas

Is the world of
*Alcatraz*
part of this whole system or is that completely different since targeted to different readers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Alcatraz*
is NOT part of this system. The
*Alcatraz*
books (indeed, most of the Young Adult books I've planned or written) need to be off on their own.
