# [Interview #428, Entry #92]: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#92)

#### Nikleas

WOT question: Rereading the series right now to get ready for
*The Gathering Storm*
, currently on book 4. Has RJ included details in his notes about who made
*Callandor*
and who placed it in the Stone of Tear (and how)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There were notes on
*Callandor*
, and the sword will play a part in the final three books. More, I cannot say. However, I'll make a note to suggest that Harriet consider this question when creating the Encyclopedia, so anything that doesn't end up in the last books is revealed there.
