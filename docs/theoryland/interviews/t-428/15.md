# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#15)

#### Chubby\_Monkey

Are you annoyed that people call you BS? After all your initials aren't the most flattering acronym.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Honestly, I've lived with it all of my life. I've been called that since grade school. Heck, I sign my books with my initials. So no, it doesn't bother me.
