# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#21)

#### Nadine

Will
*The Way of Kings*
series be based on one of the worlds and magic systems you have already created or are you inventing a totally new one for this series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will be new. There are going to be a lot of different types of magic in the world (I see there's a question below asking about that, so I'll answer more there.) But there will be two main magic systems for the first book. The first will deal with the manipulation of fundamental forces. (Gravity, Strong/weak atomic forces, Electromagnetic force, that sort of thing.) The second will be a transformation based magic system, whereby people can transform objects into one of the world's ten elements.
