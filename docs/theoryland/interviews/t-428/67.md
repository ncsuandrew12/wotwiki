# [Interview #428, Entry #67]: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#67)

#### Melhay

Is Adonalsium going to be mentioned by name in
*Warbreaker*
and
*The Way of Kings*
or is he going to be an underlining "God"(I don't know what to call him yet) idea? I am curious now, so I will have to keep my eyes open for him.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Adonalsium (Ahy-doe-Nahl-see-um) will be mentioned by name again. Ruin and Preservation were what have been called Shards of Adonalsium. (The Voice from
*Warbreaker*
is another Shard.)
