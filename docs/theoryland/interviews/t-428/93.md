# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #93](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#93)

#### Nikleas

WOT question: Probably RAFO, but same question about the land beyond the Aiel Waste (don't remember the name)? Has RJ done some worldbuilding on it and are we going to see it before the series ends or is it some Tolkienish "Oh yeah, forgot to mention or include it on the map but there's some other kind of lands out there, just so you know. But you ain't going to see it, besides they probably don't care about the fate of the world out there".

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. (But don't hold your breath. Robert Jordan said specifically: "I have no plans to send Rand to Shara" and I know several other times where he said similar things.)
