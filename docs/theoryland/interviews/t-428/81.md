# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #81](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#81)

#### Chaos2651

Can you tell us what the rest of the Feruchemical and Hemalurgic powers are? Since, you know, you won't be writing in the Mistborn world for many years, and those Feruchemical and Hemalurgic Tables might not even come into existence if the Allomantic Metals one doesn't sell. Pretty please?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will release this eventually. I'm still tweaking the powers—their names, and how they function—and so I'd rather hold off on revealing anything specific right now. We might include them in the RPG, though.

#### Chaos2651

When is the Table of Allomantic Metals coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Printer emailed me today for final confirmation. Should be very soon now.
