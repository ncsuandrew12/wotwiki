# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#12)

#### Clippership14

Also just some technical questions—did you get noticed from JABberwocky from a cold-query or did you have connections?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Originally, I queried. I got turned down. I then met Joshua at the Nebula awards and he told me to query again. That time, he liked the query and read sample chapters—then rejected those, but told me to submit to him what I wrote next. That happened a number of times, each book getting a rejection—but stronger encouragement that I was getting closer.

#### Clippership14

What was the journey like when you first sought publication?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Long, frustrating, and difficult. I wrote 13 novels before I sold
*Elantris*
, which was my sixth. The big change for me happened when I managed to figure out how to revise. I always had good ideas and got better and better at storytelling. But it was the power of revision that finally got me published.

#### Clippership14

How long did it take?

#### Brandon Sanderson

About eight years of dedicated writing and being rejected.

#### Clippership14

I'd wager not long, considering how well written
*Elantris*
is. =)

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're too kind. But remember that it was my sixth book. The first ones were dreadful.

#### Clippership14

Are you comfortable working with editors and marketing people by now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, actually. I've always been very comfortable with that part of the job. I think that after working so long on my own, being ignored, I was just finally happy to HAVE editors and marketing people.

#### Clippership14

What is the best part about promoting your books? (in your opinion)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Easy. Meeting my readers and having the chance to thank them, in person, for supporting me in my writing addiction.

#### Clippership14

As a writer, what's your favorite part of the process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first few chapters of a new book. When the world is exciting and new, and I get to do something different and challenging.

#### Clippership14

Do you have a "drawer-full" of ideas waiting to be put to paper?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More like a brain-full, but yes. It's particularly bad now as I had to shelve a number of projects I was working on in order to do the WoT. I don't regret it at all, but those stories keep pounding on the inside of my skull, yelling and begging for me to let them out.
