Any plans to tour
*Warbreaker*
or
*The Gathering Storm*
in Toronto or other Canadian cities?

I'll be in Montreal on Saturday the eighth! Less than a week away now. I'm hoping to get to other cities in Canada for future tours, but I'm going to start with this one visit. We'll see. We might be able to manage a several-city Canadian Tour next year.
