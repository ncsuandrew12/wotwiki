# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #63](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#63)

#### Zas678

What is the X in Aon Mea? Is it one of the Shard-pools?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Afraid not. Aon Mea references the expanded region within which the "Elantris Effect" will create Elantrians. The X is fertile valley with a high density of life, a place with a lot of cognitive activity. (Cognitive as defined by Realmatic Theory includes the 'thoughts' of all things that exist, not just human beings. The more complex the life form, the stronger its presence on the Cognitive Realm.)
