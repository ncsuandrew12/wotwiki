# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #54](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#54)

About your characters, Brandon: Which ones are the most like yourself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's a piece of me in every one of them, but I'm not really like any of them. People who know me well say that Alcatraz's humor reminds them of my humor (which is different from Lightsong's humor or Kelsier's humor, which are different from mine.) Elend in the original Mistborn book represents some of how I've been known to act (bringing books to social events). Shuden in
*Elantris*
has a lot of me in him, actually. Raoden has my optimism, Hrathen my logical and thoughtful (and dangerously devious) mind, Vin my pragmatic determination, and Sarene my utter lack of skill with painting or drawing. In the end, I don't know if I can pick one who is most like me. Perhaps you should ask my wife. She'd probably be better at seeing this than I am.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Your favorite male and female characters you've written?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by favorite. A lot of people ask me this question, and my response is often different. Who am I writing at the time, what I am feeling at the time? Lightsong makes me laugh, but Kelsier is conflicted in a more personal, dangerous wayâ€”and that appeals to me. Vin is best rounded, but Sazed is (perhaps) closest to my heart.

#### Joshua\_Patrao

Your favorite male/female characters of all time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Man, I'm bad at answering questions like this. Okay, male is probably Jean Valjean. Female...urg... Moiraine, maybe? Sioned from
*Dragon Prince*
is pretty awesome too. Double urg. I don't know. Jenny from
*Dragonsbane*
has long been one of my favorites, so maybe I'd pick her.
