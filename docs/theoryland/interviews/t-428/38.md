# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#38)

#### Jeremy\_Carroll

I've got a few
*Warbreaker*
questions: Is Clod a Lifeless Arsteel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Good eye.

#### Jeremy\_Carroll

Are/were all the Five Scholars Returned?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Jeremy\_Carroll

How could Vasher become Drab, since he would have to give up his Big Breath to do so?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Divine Breath can be hid. Essentially, you have to view yourself NOT as a god at all, using a very specific bit of mental gymnastics. As a Returned, your body changes based on how you see yourself. (This, by the way, is an indication that Lightsong was more pleased with himself than he ever let on.)

You don't lose your Divine Breath, but it does go into hiding, making you look like a normal person. But you're still Returned, and are consuming a Breath at one a week. If you give away your other Breaths, you retain this hidden one, but your body will still consume its own spirit if left to do so. So you still need a Breath a week to survive, and will die the week you don't get one.

I left this as an intentional place to explore the magic in the sequel, which I had planned to be writing (and posting on my website) by the time
*Warbreaker*
was out in stores. The WoT has diverted me, and so I feel bad, since this ends up being a confusing question that a number of readers have had. The hints toward how this is working are very difficult to find. (The biggest one is probably in the opening, where Vasher thinks about how he could reach the Fifth Heightening instantly, if he wanted to.)

#### Jeremy\_Carroll

Can you give any history on Denth? I don't know what he did as one of the Five Scholars. What was his roll during the Manywar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Boy, you know, I'd rather leave the history of the Five and the Manywar for the sequel. Denth was there, and at first he tried to stop it, work as a peacemaker, and eventually took Vasher's side. Until the death of his sister.

#### Jeremy\_Carroll

How would a tongueless God King give up his Breaths?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It involves the God King having a child. (Yes, it's possible.) I talk a little more about this in the annotations, but don't want to give too much away here.

Backup plan is to have a Returned heal him, like actually ended up happening.

#### Jeremy\_Carroll

If you could pick any actress to play Blushweaver in a movie based on
*Warbreaker*
, who would you pick? Monica Bulluci and Salma Hayek are top picks on your forum!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Monica Bellucci is a fantastic choice. Either her, or Angelina Jolie.
