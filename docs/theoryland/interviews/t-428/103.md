# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #103](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#103)

#### MarlonRand

Just a sudden question that popped into my head: Do you like Joss Whedon's work, specifically
*Firefly*
and
*Dr. Horrible*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I enjoyed
*Firefly*
quite a bit; I was actually among the (apparently small) group of people who watched it during its original broadcast run. I'm impressed with Joss's writing, though I'm not an enormous fan of his on the level of many of my friends.

I missed
*Dr. Horrible*
. Been meaning to watch that, actually...

There. Just added it to my Netflix queue.
