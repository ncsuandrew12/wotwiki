# [Interview #428: BarnesandNoble.com Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=428#41)

What's the earliest that we'll be seeing more of
*Scribbler*
(I'd heard a bunch about it at TWG, and so I found the sample chapters on your site and now I'm REALLY wanting more of it, so I'd like to know when I should start looking again...)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sigh. I really want to do something with
*Scribbler*
, but I can't justify it right now. I'm doing the fourth
*Alcatraz*
because I can't put it off any longer because of contracts, and
*Kings*
because Tor really wants a solo Brandon book next year. But I can't justify working too much on a project that hasn't been sold and which—if published—would end up pulling me into another side trilogy. I have to leave the WoT with the space it needs and deserves. Until it is completed, I have to shelve side projects. That, unfortunately, includes
*Scribbler*
. For now.

There are some things in the works with it, and I'm very excited about the possibilities. But there's nothing tangible I can give you now. It's coming. Maybe sooner than I've made it sound, but best to be careful as nothing is set yet.
