This is a collection of WoT-related tweets only. For a complete catalog of Brandon's tweets, visit the
[Twitter Portal](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/)
at Brandon's website. The catalog of tom:wip tweets (that is,
*Towers of Midnight*
: Work In Progress) is a little more sparse than the amol:wip catalog, where I pay more attention to the conversation with the fans.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 September 2009)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4461973681)

Today's work: Write the wind's scene in
*Towers of Midnight*
. (As I've noted, I'm not going through the books in order, but by viewpoint.)

## [Entry #2](./t-45/2)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 October 2009)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/4634825591)

Tossed the section from
*Towers of Midnight*
I wrote on Friday. I knew at the time it wasn't working, but sometimes you need to finish so you can redo it.

## [Entry #3](./t-45/3)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (1 December 2009)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6252163590)

1200 words of
*Towers of Midnight*
written today. The ball is rolling again, and the exhaustion caused by the tour is wearing off.

## [Entry #4](./t-45/4)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (22 December 2009)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/6942433913)

Two things are slowing me. First, I feel
*Towers of Midnight*
will need to be longer than
*The Gathering Storm*
. Second, a major plotline needs an overhaul.

#### Footnote

Brandon later
[indicated](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=547)
(as many fans suspected) that the overhaul was Mat's plotline.

## [Entry #5](./t-45/5)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/7694223915)

**Q:**
Why has the
*Towers of Midnight*
progress bar been stuck at the same number for so long?

**A:**
Been doing revisions. Plan to do a
[blog post](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/870/Some-Long-Awaited-Updates)
soon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/7694308342)

Problem: I want the book to work on its own, and not feel like "All of the stuff that didn't go in
*The Gathering Storm*
thrown together."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/7694546315)

This book needs to be at least as good as
*The Gathering Storm*
, if not better. Either way, it's probably going to be longer—consider yourself warned.

## [Entry #6](./t-45/6)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (22 February 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/9501011919)

Today's work: Re-reading Perrin chapters from
*The Path of Daggers*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/9502208401)

I'd totally forgotten about the scarf-in-the-mouth moment. Ha. Wonderful. (And no, this isn't meant to be a clue about anything.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/9502249470)

I just feel it important to often re-read Jordan's original writings to make certain I don't let the characters voices stray.

## [Entry #7](./t-45/7)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 February 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/9551190977)

Man, it's been too long since I read through the WoT straight through. Elyas snuck up on Gaul? Totally forgot about that moment.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/9551254034)

That might be the most challenging part of writing these books—the need to constantly be re-reading the originals to keep myself accurate.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/9551347078)

Even then, I miss things. Witness my Bashere/Tenobia goof from the last book. Thank heaven for Maria and Alan.

## [Entry #8](./t-45/8)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 March 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/10536488675)

Twelve more chapters to go in current
*Towers of Midnight*
revision. It's going very well. I hope to have this section in Harriet's hands by Jordancon.

## [Entry #9](./t-45/9)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 April 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/12087429741)

Also, I want to say that YES the manuscript for
*The Way of Kings*
went in to Tor. A tad late, but it is done. Back to WoT!

## [Entry #10](./t-45/10)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (26 April 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/12913087891)

I am revising a chapter of
*Towers of Midnight*
while I wait for my assistant to bring me papers to grade. Deadline to get the book in has been set: August 17.

## [Entry #11](./t-45/11)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (29 April 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13085788413)

Just cut about four pages off of a chapter of
*Towers of Midnight*
. Sorry. It's for your own good.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13089539325)

To respond to questions:
*Towers of Midnight*
is still on schedule, though it will be very tight. I need to turn it in early August at the latest.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13090582333)

Whew. That chapter was very full of fat. Trimmed a lot.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13097703395)

About two hundred pages of
*Towers of Midnight*
revised; two hundred more in this part before I can write new material. Right now, one hour off for dinner.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13108775765)

Hope to get five more chapters revised tonight. That will place me in a position to do a new chapter tomorrow.

## [Entry #12](./t-45/12)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (3 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13319369162)

Back to work on
*Towers of Midnight*
! Had a stomach bug over the weekend that slowed me down a little, but I'm fine now.

## [Entry #13](./t-45/13)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13352676421)

Finally back to writing new material for
*Towers of Midnight*
. Started a new chapter tonight.

## [Entry #14](./t-45/14)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13413994015)

*Towers of Midnight*
was at 320k words. Dropped to 275k after merciless cutting of bad chapters. Now back up to 280k. Makes progress bar tough to estimate.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13446547808)

Getting ready to send a chunk of
*Towers of Midnight*
to Team Jordan. First, need to see if I spelled anyone's name wrong. I'm looking at you, Gallenne.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13447898518)

Grr. Why do I always spell '
*damane*
' as '
*demane*
' instead? I've only written it a hundred times or so.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13449081302)

It's off. 400 pages (about 80k words) sent for first reactions from Team Jordan. You can count this as the first step in turning in the book.

## [Entry #15](./t-45/15)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13524664179)

Very pleased with progress on
*Towers of Midnight*
during the last few days. Wish I could post specifics.

## [Entry #16](./t-45/16)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13807326066)

One of the chapters I cut from
*Towers of Midnight*
is going back in. (After some heavy revisions.)

## [Entry #17](./t-45/17)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/13893237989)

Always pleasant to read back through chapters you wrote months ago and find they're actually pretty good.

## [Entry #18](./t-45/18)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/14029024570)

Yes, Wheel of Time Fans, I am indeed up a 4am working on your book. This section I'm editing now turned out really well.

## [Entry #19](./t-45/19)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/14348454001)

Now at work on some last tweaks before sending the next chunk of
*Towers of Midnight*
to Team Jordan.

## [Entry #20](./t-45/20)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (24 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/14648390472)

Writing new material for
*Towers of Midnight*
again today. Really need to update that progress bar, eh?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/14648491374)

Here's a better way to show you progress: I have sixteen scenes (some long, some short) that need to be written before the book is done.

## [Entry #21](./t-45/21)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (26 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/14748984366)

For those keeping track, I have finished 2/16 last scenes I need to complete before
*Towers of Midnight*
is done.

## [Entry #22](./t-45/22)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/14896724511)

Whew. Chapter done. Very tired. It was a scene you’ve been waiting a long time to read. No, not that one. And not that one either.

## [Entry #23](./t-45/23)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (31 May 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15122856827)

Also, just sent
*Towers of Midnight*
version 7.0 to Team Jordan. Getting close to a complete draft now. Eight scenes left to write.

## [Entry #24](./t-45/24)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (1 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15201697738)

Back at work on
*Towers of Midnight*
. I managed to get two of the shorter scenes done yesterday. Six more left. They're longer ones, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15223426705)

Doing some reading in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
to catch up on something I need for the chapter I'm writing tonight. Let the speculation begin.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15226110022)

Jumped to first quarter of
*Knife of Dreams*
to continue research. Almost have what I need.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15231636293)

This chapter is starting to work now. Last one I'll write before turning to a chunk of revisions.

## [Entry #25](./t-45/25)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15237392266)

Done. Whew. Last new writing on the book for a while, probably a week or two. Four or five scenes remaining. Must revise/prepare first.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15273176163)

I went ahead and moved the
*Towers of Midnight*
bar on my website up to 90%. Five scenes left to write, but a TON of revision on top of it.

## [Entry #26](./t-45/26)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15401056942)

Done with this group of revisions on
*Towers of Midnight*
. Now, the dreaded spellcheck.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15443235906)

Okay, spellcheck done, revisions sent in to Team Jordan. Things are looking very good for the
*Towers of Midnight*
deadlines.

## [Entry #27](./t-45/27)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (7 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15655284914)

Working on
*Towers of Midnight*
. Changing the text based on Team Jordan's first round of comments on the finished portions.

## [Entry #28](./t-45/28)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15765356689)

Whew. 300 pages of
*Towers of Midnight*
edited today. 8.0 draft 1/3 of the way done. Should go back to Team Jordan by early next week. Maybe sooner.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15830677704)

Nine more chapters to revise this time through. Hopefully, they aren't all as tough as this last one.

## [Entry #29](./t-45/29)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15912747299)

'He stood there waiting for one of the Forsaken to leap out of the flames in the marble fireplace, or the earth to swallow the Palace...'

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15912794550)

This is the kind of awesome line I love the WoT for. You miss it the 1st time, but years later, it blows your mind.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/15960796368)

About 150 pages of 450 pages worth of my WoT rereading is done. The next sections I write will be the last new material for this book.

## [Entry #30](./t-45/30)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/16171742933)

Hum. Slow going over the weekend. Maybe I need to find some more Magic cards to motivate myself.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/16179262660)

Just began writing on one of the last chapters I need to do for the book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/16261931753)

Blarg. This chapter I'm revising is really rough. Needs a structural rewrite.

## [Entry #31](./t-45/31)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (19 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/16571768653)

That chapter of
*Towers of Midnight*
I just wrote ends with a cliffhanger. Sorry about that. I pick it up soon, though, so you won't have to wait long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/16573027882)

I promise this cliffhanger chapter isn't the last one in the book. In fact, it's closer to the front.

#### [PETER AHLSTROM (28 JUNE—FACEBOOK COMMENTS)](http://www.facebook.com/Mistborn?v=wall&story_fbid=132871366735608&ref=mf)

This wasn't the final chapter of the book, which he wrote a while ago. This was the last chapter he had left to write, and it happens somewhere before the end of the book.

#### [TEREZ (8 JULY)](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/18069869786)

Are we to assume that the end of
*Towers of Midnight*
will NOT be a cliffhanger? You seemed eager to reassure us. Or RAFO?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18071290908)

RAFO. It was just that chapter I was talking about.

## [Entry #32](./t-45/32)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 June 2010)](http://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson?v=wall&story_fbid=132081006814907&ref=mf)

Okay, two new scenes left to write on
*Towers of Midnight*
. (Along with a lot of revision still to do.) I will write one of them tonight.

## [Entry #33](./t-45/33)

#### [Tragoul (29 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/#!/Tragoul/status/17377833750)

Do you try to write straight through a book from start to finish or do you write random bits and then put them together?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17397303066)

I usually write straight through, sometimes by plot line. But some books—like
*Towers of Midnight*
—don't let me do that.

## [Entry #34](./t-45/34)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 June 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17274672071)

Ladies and Gentlemen, I have begun writing the final chapter for
*Towers of Midnight*
. Expect an "It's done" post later today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17285384553)

And...it is DONE! 359,000 words, 1800 pages in manuscript form. Nobody tell Tor. They asked me to try to keep it shorter. WHOOPS.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17285903896)

Note that I'm mostly joking about the length. Tor does prefer books shorter than 400k, but they've always let me write as long as needed.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17285952315)

And, just to warn you all, I WILL do my standard 10% cut on this book. So expect the final length to be around 320k or so. (
*The Gathering Storm*
was 300k.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17286096923)

Either way, the first draft of
*Towers of Midnight*
is done. We are now confirmed for an on-time release late October or early November 2010.

## [Entry #35](./t-45/35)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (1 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17548019189)

Joke from Harriet and Maria in margins of
*Towers of Midnight*
manuscript. Re: sealing the Bore. DON'T call BP.

#### Footnote

The
[BP oil spill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill)
was fairly current news at the time.

## [Entry #36](./t-45/36)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17555382462)

Thank goodness for Maria and Alan. Every time I start to think I know the WoT world pretty well, they prove that I've got a long way to go.

## [Entry #37](./t-45/37)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17817490678)

Time for everyone's favorite draft, the one where I cut 10-15% of the book, line by line.
*Towers of Midnight*
is at 362k words. Can I get it under 310?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17818830894)

14.5% cut from the first scene of
*Towers of Midnight*
. In reply, I'm hoping to have this done in ten days. Faster, if possible.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17820975603)

8.9% cut from next scene. Trust me, as I warn every time I post about this process, you DON'T want these words. This makes the book better.

## [Entry #38](./t-45/38)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17848115679)

Back at work. 14% or so cut from the next scene. These are various parts of the prologue, if you're curious.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17851153968)

12.6% cut from the next scene. Two more to do in the prologue.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17855092569)

3.5% and 8.2% from next two [scenes]. Many are asking if I can, someday, show what I cut. Maybe someday.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17855126428)

This book belongs to Harriet, so releasing anything—even lists of cut words—must be done carefully. Easier to show you with
*The Way of Kings*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17855410026)

Hello first paragraph of Chapter One. I guess I'm not cutting any words from you....

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17899484724)

Sigh. For those complaining that you don't want me to cut the book at all, the next chapter GREW by 1.7%. Added more than I cut.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17902127746)

14% cut from next one. Editing is not much fun. Maybe I need to buy more Magic cards to motivate me. Open one pack per five chapters? Hm...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17906620650)

760 words cut from the next chapter. It's a big one, though, so that's only 12%.

#### [BRIAN CARBIN](http://twitter.com/Brian_C_AU/status/17924213794)

Ever thought of doing unabridged i.e. not cut spec-eds of your books? It worked for King and Feist.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17926151979)

Thing is, none of these edits are forced on me. These are edits I want to do. If I were ever forced to cut, Maybe.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17924018216)

For @ramhiser and others wondering, I run a spreadsheet to tell me how much I've cut. I find if I measure, it makes me more rigorous.

## [Entry #39](./t-45/39)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (7 July 2010)](http://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson#%21/BrandonSandrson?v=wall&story_fbid=131255600248472&ref=mf)

12% and 15% on the next two chapters. The one coming up is one of the ones that needs the most work. Joy.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17929007237)

Lots of repeated description, passive language, and unneeded dialogue tags. Also, some distracting character ponderings.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17934531807)

Okay, major overhaul to that chapter is done. 8.5% cut, though that's only a weak indication of the gutting—then rebuilding—it was given.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/17987986516)

2% added to the next chapter. (Sigh.) 12% cut from the one after that. 5500 words total cut so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18012419824)

Back to editing. People are asking what chapter I'm on, but the chapters don't have numbers yet. Order isn't 100% nailed down yet either.

## [Entry #40](./t-45/40)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18014359054)

9% on the next chapter, then 15.5% on the next. (Which is one of my favorites, but needed a mighty trim anyway.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18023625529)

Last for the night: 8%, 10.5%, 12% cut from three chapters. We are about 15% of the way through the draft. Going slower than I wanted.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18068177740)

1/2 of 1 % cut from the next chapter. Stated that way, it doesn't seem like I've been doing anything for the last hour. (Had to add a lot.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18072062075)

9.8% off the next chapter. That's more like it.

## [Entry #41](./t-45/41)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18107723806)

10% cut from the next chapter; last for the night. Need some sleep.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18153923774)

Angry email today from someone telling me to stop 'whining' about
*Towers of Midnight*
's length. Not whining, dude, just trying to push myself hard to edit.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18153995722)

The goal of this revision is to cut, not to add. I'll do either one to help the book, but I set goals for myself and try hard to meet them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18154072194)

The final book will be the length it must be. But during this edit, my mindset HAS to be "Cut" or I'll get lazy and let bad language slide.

## [Entry #42](./t-45/42)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18183457366)

Short night working tonight. 7.31% cut from the next chapter. Have to get up early tomorrow. Can't work as late as normal.

## [Entry #43](./t-45/43)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18377560747)

9.2% off of the next (very long) chapter. This revision is looking good so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18382523632)

4.6% off the next chapter. With some additions. In answer to a question: I am editing in order, not by character thread.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18388999857)

12.8% and 9.2% cut from the next two chapters. All goes well so far. Still a lot of work to do. (This is the 1/4 mark in the revision.)

## [Entry #44](./t-45/44)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18456362019)

15.3% and 12.3% cut from two chapters last night. 10k words cut so far. (Forgot to post this before I went to bed.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18489586318)

Latest revision stats: 20%, 5.6%, and 8.4% cut from what will probably be chapters 25, 26, and 27 in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

## [Entry #45](./t-45/45)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18499466649)

Chapter 28 is the longest in the book, I think. I just cut 12.5% from it, and it's still 8k words long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18507088644)

Off to bed. 12%, 18%, 12% cut from latest chapters. Book is under 350k words now. About 35% through the revision.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18553606245)

14.3%, 14.7%, 13.7%, 15.2% cut from the last four chapters Really getting into the groove of editing now.

## [Entry #46](./t-45/46)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18587709594)

18%, 11%, 13% cut on next three. Whew. This is getting grueling. I'm gonna need to buy more Magic cards. (What? The logic works in my head.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18638839078)

17% cut from the next chapter.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18649870668)

15% and 17% cut from the next two chapters, which means one more and I can open one of those packs of magic cards. Onward!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18657503634)

Whew. 9.5% cut from that chapter. I WOULD have to end up doing one of the longest ones in the book this time. Now, Magic cards!

## [Entry #47](./t-45/47)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18667688696)

Another beast of a chapter done. 12% cut. Why is it I write such long books, again? Anyway, one more chapter, and I get another pack.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18671904234)

13% on the next chapter. And, because I wanted to push on, I managed to do another. 16%. About halfway through the revision now.

## [Entry #48](./t-45/48)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18756677007)

21% and 16% cut from those two chapters tonight. And I'm going to open a pack of cards. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18797752049)

Two chapters edited today: 22% and 14% cut.

## [Entry #49](./t-45/49)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (19 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18936691363)

5.5% cut from my first chapter edited today. Need to work hard the first part of the week, since ComicCon will steal a few days later.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/18945855829)

15% cut, followed by 9% on the next chapter.

## [Entry #50](./t-45/50)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19016798397)

11% cut from the next chapter. At about 60% done now. Maybe a little more.

## [Entry #51](./t-45/51)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19057637404)

By the way, 9% cut from the last chapter. That was a tough one to revise.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19059950239)

Well, that was brutal. 71% cut from that chapter, the remaining bit spliced onto the end of the last chapter.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19059971294)

In revision, I'd decided to do what this chapter did in another chapter, and did it better there. So this one got gutted.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19105812609)

First airport chapter cut by 10%. One of my favorites in the book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19217522511)

15% cut from the chapter I edited on the flight.

## [Entry #52](./t-45/52)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (22 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19233892798)

10% cut from the next chapter.

## [Entry #53](./t-45/53)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19325521485)

Blarg. This chapter is giving me all kinds of grief. Maybe I should just cut the whole thing. (Kidding.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19389350713)

By the way, 17% cut from the first chapter I did today and 7% cut from the next one. 75% done, about 34k words cut from the book so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19394413237)

Well, 1% cut from that chapter. I had a request from Maria to add in a large chunk, which was the right suggestion.

## [Entry #54](./t-45/54)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (24 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19402664524)

12% off next chapter.

## [Entry #55](./t-45/55)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19539044687)

Little note on
*Towers of Midnight*
: Last night's chapter cut 11%. 22 scenes left to do. Goal is to have it done by Thursday.

## [Entry #56](./t-45/56)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (26 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19558677231)

Okay, 16% cut.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19606969835)

8% cut from Chapter 80. In other news, the chapters have numbers now. 94 chapters in the book plus a multi-scene epilogue.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19618725149)

Chapter 81 is a heart-wrenching one. Maybe the one in the book I'm most proud of, despite its contents. Anyway, 18.5% cut from it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19626645877)

Chapter 82—13% cut. I do think that some of these chapters may be combined before the end. I doubt the final book will have 94 chapters.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19634795588)

12.2% cut from the next chapter.

#### Footnote

The 'heart-wrenching' scene was Aviendha's second trip through the crystal columns.

## [Entry #57](./t-45/57)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (27 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19636995121)

Chapter 84: 13.5% cut. On a roll today, though perhaps it's because the end of this stage is in sight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19640581879)

8.3% cut off the next chapter. I think that means I did 8 chapters today, which is a record.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19645319113)

Another 8.3% on the next chapter.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19688771244)

All is coming together. Exchanged emails with Team Jordan. I suspect the final book will end up around 60 chapters, after combining scenes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19689259070)

Also, 9.6% on the next chapter. 7+Epilogue remaining.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19695202025)

After what may be known as the Great Chapter Melding of 2010, I merged many shorter chapters together.
*Towers of Midnight*
is now 70 chapters long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19695240991)

This feels like the right number to me. It may change by one or two from here, but I think we're close to final.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19713139652)

**Q:**
Has the chapter you mentioned earlier (the painful one that is one of your favorites) changed numbers now?
  
**A:**
Yes. It's #60 now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19716716765)

Several of these last chapters are ones that need a lot of revision. So tonight is not going to go as quickly.

## [Entry #58](./t-45/58)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19719243933)

Chapter 66 increased in size by 2.5%. (Really, more like it increased by 10%, then I cut the chapter down.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19724167430)

Whew. 67 edited. That took a lot of work. A lot added, a lot cut. End result: Cut by 7.8%. 3 chapters and epilogue left. (About 100 pgs.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19772419073)

Heh. Line from
*Towers of Midnight*
said: "And Rand did such and such." Brain keeps reading "Ayn Rand." Did Goodkind sneak over and rewrite my manuscript?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19774838304)

5% cut from the last of the three 'Needs special attention" chapters I just revised, added to, and edited. Gets easier from here out.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19776935603)

These are manuscript pages, so in print, that would be more like 50 pages.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19779306131)

Typed in new wordcount for chapter. Excel spreadsheet responds: Chapter size increased by 748%. Uh, think I left a number off somewhere...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19779362207)

After a typo fix in the spreadsheet: Chapter 69 cut by 15.2%. 50 [manuscript] pages left to revise.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19789194845)

Before I left, I almost got chapter 70 done. Finished now, 4% cut. I've been over it often in other drafts, and didn't need as much a trim.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19789418947)

Onward to the epilogue; it's 6k words long.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19791603284)

12% cut from first scene of the epilogue. Five to go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19792591776)

6.8% cut from the next scene. Four to go.

#### [BRANDON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19793702769)

Well, look at this. One last person in the epilogue I forgot to name. Glenn Bergevin. You're in. 7% cut from the scene you are in.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19794421758)

13.9%. Two short scenes left.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19795068994)

12.2%. One more to go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19796076216)

And...13.4% from the last scene. Book length is 320,286 words. 42,614 words cut. 11.7%. About 5k more than
*Knife of Dreams*
; 4th longest in the series.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19796173105)

Hold off on celebrating TOO much, though. Needs a spellcheck, and a spot fix some problems Team Jordan has mentioned about earlier chapters.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19796402554)

Then it gets sent to a secret cabal of beta readers (no, you can't join them. Sorry.) I spot fix problems they find, then a last quick draft.

## [Entry #59](./t-45/59)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (29 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19817299020)

Okay, new draft off to Team Charleston, and I can go sleep now. Tomorrow: More spot fixes.

## [Entry #60](./t-45/60)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (30 July 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19898280911)

Document in the hands of beta readers. Time is counting down to our deadline. Hope they read quickly...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19944617965)

Okay, I stayed up way too late (about 6:00am) getting the
*Towers of Midnight*
document to beta readers. Feeling worn out today. Will read for writing group.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19947863434)

Many are asking about how to become beta readers. Well, it's different for my own books than it is for WoT...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/19947963713)

For WoT, Harriet's in charge; the betas are people she trusts and knows. For myself, it varies by book. Usually people I know, though.

## [Entry #61](./t-45/61)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (2 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20119855868)

Onward. Need to get a tweaked draft of
*Towers of Midnight*
to Harriet tomorrow. Two weeks left on our deadline to get the final, final draft to Tor.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20122532400)

Going through
*Towers of Midnight*
and adding chapter names/icons (both chosen by Harriet) and combining chapters at her direction.

#### [NICK CASSANOVA](http://twitter.com/BreakTheMirror/status/20123128834)

With the newly combined chapters, which is the sad chapter that you had said was number 60?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20123503945)

Don't know yet. I have to check with Harriet on a few more combinations before I will have a final chapter total.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20165449167)

Today's task: Going through
*Towers of Midnight*
and giving italics/cap letters to in world terms. (And taking away caps from others that I got wrong.)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/20192883324)

Ditto. (Re-tweet)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20175540656)

Working on epigraphs for
*Towers of Midnight*
right now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185296529)

**Q:**
Now that the chapters have been changed around, what is the new number of chapter 81? (The one you said was one of your favorite?)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185312166)

**A:**
That is now chapter 50. It should remain there.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185585219)

Good question: @graphicbin\_sean asks "Who chooses the scenes for the cover art for WoT? How about
*Towers of Midnight*
?"

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20185706428)

**A:**
Harriet usually picks. I picked the scenes for
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
, though, as we had to get them painted before Harriet read the books.

#### [SHIVAM BHATT](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/20179299505)

Who writes the [glossary] entries at the back of every WoT book?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20188353292)

Maria does those.

## [Entry #62](./t-45/62)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20717634859)

Okay, up bright and early (well, for me) and starting work on the
*Towers of Midnight*
final draft. Need to do 10% of it today at the minimum.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20739140343)

A visit from an old friend from out of town slowed me, but I'm back on track. 1% down so far. Going to be a long week...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20753458300)

5% done. At least that much left to go today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20759772507)

Okay, 6%. Hit a little patch that needed some extra work, thought, and rewriting. Pleased with it now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20770820359)

9% done on the last
*Towers of Midnight*
revision. Looking good, though Peter tells me I should try for 14% a day if I want to hit Monday's goal.

## [Entry #63](./t-45/63)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20773785888)

Today's 10% done; will keep going. (Note, these percentages aren't cuts, like last time. This is how far through the book I am.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20778010276)

Okay, 12% done today. Will go to bed now. Trying to sleep a little earlier/rise a little earlier this week.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20822776429)

*Towers of Midnight*
update: 15% of the final revision done, despite Limeboy climbing in my lap and insisting that I show him Spongebob on the computer.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20832875928)

17% of the revision done so far. (5% so far today.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20843901805)

19% done so far. (7% today) Had a bit of a slow down with a scene I needed to add, but am through that and moving onward.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20851680664)

**Question from Peter on Facebook:**
Is this final revision final? If you're adding scenes, won't there be more touch-up?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20851784997)

**A:**
After this is turned in, the book goes to copyedit & proofreads. Small things can be fixed/changed then. You could call those 'drafts.'

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20851829971)

I don't see them that way, as this is my last full read-through the book. Maria will do the copyedit approvals. I may still tweak, though.

## [Entry #64](./t-45/64)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20865606397)

Just hit 24% edited so far on the
*Towers of Midnight*
final revision. Whew. Still an hour or so left to go today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20915646814)

27% done on the revision, 3% finished so far today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20925007130)

30% done, 6% today. Approaching the 1/3 mark. Time is running out, though. I foresee a long day next Monday, pushing through to the end.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20949904424)

33.5% done as of this last scene. 1/3 down. Producer Jordo is on his way home and I'm back at editing.

## [Entry #65](./t-45/65)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/20998165146)

By the way, got to 37% last night before I crashed. Back up and working on it again now.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21011459124)

41% edited so far in the book. Halfway point in sight. Might hit it tonight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21031736421)

Quick note. 46% done.

## [Entry #66](./t-45/66)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21043702367)

Okay, guys, I know this is tragic to hear...but your book needs a new scene. Out of rewriting mode. Into new writing mode. (Sigh.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21045859652)

New scene done. (Wasn't very long; added it to the end of another scene.) Onward with editing.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21047349598)

And...small drum roll...50%. Took me four days. At this rate, taking Sunday off, I will be done Tuesday instead of Monday. We shall see.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21050124566)

Ending tonight at 51%. Spent some of my time going back and looking over the new scene, giving it a few drafts. Night, all.

## [Entry #67](./t-45/67)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21090342700)

Back to work on
*Towers of Midnight*
. Canceled Writing Group tonight to get more time. Goal for today is to get to 66%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21093539169)

Hm. This scene needs better description. Well, off to the Big White Book to do a little research on how the area should look...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21100340767)

For those following along, the scene that I cut from
*Towers of Midnight*
, then found a way to add back in, is now in chapter 30.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21106737225)

At 53% so far today. Man, I need to step it up, eh? Not sure what is causing me to go so slowly today. Only 2% so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21110838054)

Okay, at 55%. Much better progress through this hour.

#### [BOB GIBSON](http://twitter.com/HonorGod/status/21052616064)

How do you determine that a book needs another scene, especially so late in the process?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21111226764)

Just instincts. Something needed to be added to properly pace the narrative.

#### [BEL'SHAMHAROTH](http://twitter.com/Bel_shamharoth/status/21101100648)

I don't suppose you'd be willing to give us a hint on what was so important that you needed to add a new scene this late?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 AUGUST)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21130014478)

It's less that it was super important, and more I felt a new scene would smooth things.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21136854497)

Oh, and at 62%. Not sure if I'll hit that 66% mark or not.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21142037926)

Okay, 64% will have to be the end for tonight. 5am. Seems like a good time for bed.

What am I doing? I'm most certainly NOT adding two more quick scenes to
*Towers of Midnight*
. Why do you ask? (Hides under his bed, keeps typing.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21191546597)

Okay, completely rewrote a section of a climactic scene that I wasn't satisfied with, and two new scenes added to enhance it. Much better.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21192545464)

Hope Team Jordan doesn't kill me for adding this so late. Note, none of these were added 'just because.' I really felt the book needed them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21204990541)

Ha! Just looked at the new Beta reader file, and it includes a suggestion for a new scene...doing exactly what I just added on my own today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21208190041)

Okay, new scenes are looking good.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/21162245051)

So what do the beta readers do? Are they pretty much editors like Harriet and look to see how book flows or what?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21303033985)

Betas are like a test audience. Like the kind you'd pre-screen a movie for before releasing it.

## [Entry #69](./t-45/69)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (16 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21293467015)

All right. Sunday's over, and the last push has begun. Book is due ASAP. Let's get this thing done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21296928956)

75% of the final rewrite of
*Towers of Midnight*
is done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21302750062)

78%. Normally, 4:00 would be time to go to bed, but I took a nap today to get me ready for the long haul. Onward we go, then.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21311170466)

At about 85% from the work over night. Is that the sun? Hello.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21324173249)

At the 90% mark on the
*Towers of Midnight*
final draft.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21336612420)

Still here. 93%. Going a little slower than I was earlier in the night, but still determined to make deadline.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21339350691)

94% And a thunderstorm rolls past. (looks upward.) Thanks. Very narratively appropriate.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21340487811)

95% done. Note: though it seems I'm coming down to the wire, know that if I weren't confident the book were right, I'd have pulled it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21340564195)

I went into this revision knowing that we were almost there. I wouldn't release the book at almost, though, regardless of consequences.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21341993352)

96% I am feeling very good about the things I have fixed in this draft. This is going to be a great book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21344466502)

97% done. The end is in sight, folks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21346987293)

98%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21348520300)

99%.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21350398138)

Ladies and gentlemen...last draft is done.
*Towers of Midnight*
is set for an on-time release, November 2nd.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21352347708)

And it is off. Last draft sent to Team Jordan for a final review. They will have some final questions/tweaks for me when I wake up.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21352403630)

I will do those tonight after I wake up from crashing, then will send the book to Tor so it is in by the time people get to work tomorrow.

## [Entry #70](./t-45/70)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21379567457)

Okay, back up. Now for the "epilogue" of finishing the last draft—looking through last moment comments from Team Jordan on what I changed.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21383237437)

And at 1:00, my tireless assistant Peter (Ahlstrom) just left the office (my basement) for home. His copyedit of
*Towers of Midnight*
is done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21397131543)

And...six hours later...all of the final notations by Team Jordan are done. And now, everyone's favorite activity. The Last Spellcheck!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21399039600)

Going over Table of contents...adding glossary...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21399746751)

And the file is off to Tor. Final version crept up to 328,000 words (with the new scenes) and is 57 chapters + a prologue and epilogue.

## [Entry #71](./t-45/71)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (19 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21612066557)

Okay, back at the computer after a few days of relaxing and spending time with the family. Working on a
[blog post](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/911/TOWERS-OF-MIDNIGHT-Is-Done)
about
*Towers of Midnight*
.
