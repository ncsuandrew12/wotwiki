Hi guys,

I read the first NYC signing report, and I thought I'd share. The
[report from David Funke](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=834)
, the MiserableRainGod, is pretty accurate. No announcement from Mr. Jordan or anything. He just came in, sat down and started signing. I got on line just as he came in, so I was pretty far back. The store had the line snake around the bookshelves so you really couldn't hear any of the questions that people asked him until you were pretty much right there. It's too bad.

#### Robert Jordan

I was on line for maybe 45 minutes, and halfway through, Mr. Jordan made a loud announcement so us peons hidden by the bookshelves could hear. I can't remember his words verbatim, but he said something along the lines of "Hi everybody, I have an announcement to make. Someone finally asked 'When the next book will be out?'. And I can positively guarantee that the next book will be printed, released, and on and your store shelves on.... a date shortly after I finish writing it!" That got quite a few chuckles.

#### Byryn

Anyhow, I as I was getting my book signed I asked Mr. Jordan flat out (with a smile), "So are you going to reveal who killed him by the end? Or are you going to let us stew forever?"

#### Robert Jordan

He said that if the natural course of the story brings him there, he will answer that question. But if he doesn't include it, he promised that he will reveal the killer by the time the paperback of the last book comes out.
