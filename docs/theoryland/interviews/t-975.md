And now, notes from the booksellers I stopped at during the tour:

Books-A-Million (757 Brookwood Village, Birmingham, AL 35209)
  
We have 55 copies at our store in Birmingham. If customers want to purchase one, we will need them to purchase an E-Certificate (or gift card) and call us at 205-870-0213. (We cannot take credit cards over the phone for security purposes). We can ship them directly to them.

BYU Bookstore (Brigham Young University, University Hill, Provo, Utah 84602)
  
We have about 15 that are signed with numbers and about 15 what are just signed. We will ship them in the order in which we receive the orders, sending out numbered copies first followed by the signed copies. All signed copies have been signed by Brandon, Harriet and Maria. The link to our page is here.

Borderlands Books (866 Valencia St., San Francisco, CA 94110)
  
We can certainly do mail orders. I think we've got about 20 signed copies left. If you'd like to let folks know, they can call us toll-free at 888-893-4008, or order from us online via Biblio.com using this link.

Bakka-Phoenix Books (84 Harbord Street, Toronto, ON M5S 1G5 Canada)
  
We definitely have signed copies of
*A Memory of Light*
, and also a little signed stock of some of Brandon's other titles (in particular,
*The Emperor's Soul*
). They can call us at 416-963-9993, or email. There's also a 'Contact Us' link on our website. We do charge for shipping.

University Bookstore (4326 University Way, NE, Seattle, WA 98105)
  
I have at least 30 copies of the presigned eds still upstairs. I also have at least 15 or more of the copies signed at the event by Brandon and Harriet. I also have 2 or 3
*Legion*
left, and a stack of
*The Emperor's Soul*
. Customers can call us at : 1-800-335-7323, and here's the page for
*A Memory of Light*
(you may have to click that link twice for it to work). Customers should be sure to note in the comment box at the end that they want a signed copy.

Mysterious Galaxy (7051 Clairemont Mesa Blvd., #302, San Diego, CA 92111)
  
We have a little over 100 signed copies, some of which are also signed by Harriet. 858-268-4747

Quail Ridge Books (3522 Wade Avenue, Raleigh, NC 27607)
  
We have 54 signed copies. Here is a link to the book on our website. Unfortunately it does not reflect the discounted NYT best seller price which would be $27.99. If they are members of our readers club the price would be $24.49. This price would be reflected in the amount charged. No shipping charges on orders $25 or more. Our phone number is 919/828-1588

The Signed Page
  
I have a few extra copies of
*A Memory of Light*
, the final Wheel of Time book! They are 1st Edition / 1st Printing and are double-signed by Brandon Sanderson and long-time Wheel of Time editor Harriet McDougal!

Toadstool Bookshops (614 Nashua Street, Lordens Plaza, Milford, NH 30355)
  
We have a dozen signed copies left over in NH after our signing. I might have asked for more, but Brandon looked like he was going to keel over. We do still have several cases of (unsigned) first editions. Someone at the event pointed out that some of our books were 6th printings, which we swapped out to keep the 1st editions going. Calling us direct would be the best: 603-673-1734 EST at the Toadstool Bookshop, Milford, NH. Open M-Sa 9-9, Su 11-5.
