# [Interview #913: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Fantasy Book Critic, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=913#1)

#### Robert Thompson

With his standalone debut novel
*Elantris*
and the current Mistborn trilogy, the second volume (
*The Well of Ascension*
) of which was recently released in August 2007, Brandon Sanderson has established himself as a writer to watch and has become one of my favorite new fantasy authors out there. So securing an interview was always a goal of mine. Unfortunately, Mr. Sanderson has quite the workload, finishing up the Mistborn trilogy, writing a new children's fantasy series that just debuted (
*Alcatraz Versus The Evil Librarians*
â€”October 1, 2007), working on various other projects (
*Warbreaker*
,
*Dragonsteel*
,
*Scribbler*
, etc.), not to mention the book tour and a new addition to the family :D So, I was extremely grateful that Mr. Sanderson took the time to answer what questions he could and I hope that you'll enjoy the following interview. And for more Q&A fun, be sure to check out
