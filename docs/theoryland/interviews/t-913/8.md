#### Robert Thompson

Cover art is another area that is very important to you and one of the highlights of your books has been the uniquely breathtaking artwork. That trend continues in
*The Well of Ascension*
as artist
[Jon Foster](http://www.jonfoster.com/)
(
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
) outdoes himself in what I think is the best cover yet. So, just wondering what your thoughts are on how the artwork for
*The Well of Ascension*
turned out, how it stacks up to the other booksâ€™ covers, and any other thoughts you may have on the topic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really liked
[Jon Foster](http://www.jonfoster.com/)
's art. I think he captures movement and action well, which was excellent on the Mistborn covers.
[Foster](http://www.jonfoster.com/)
's covers almost look like stained glass pieces themselves, and with the sort of gothic cathedrals I had in mind for some of the scenes of
*The Well of Ascension*
, this was perfect. As far as my personal opinion, I like the cover of
*Well*
better than that of
*Final Empire*
, but not quite as much as the cover for
*Elantris*
. I have to say, though, that the image they've chosen for Mistborn 3 may make it my favorite cover yet.
