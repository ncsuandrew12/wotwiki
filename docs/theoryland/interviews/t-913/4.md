# [Interview #913: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Fantasy Book Critic, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=913#4)

#### Robert Thompson

In both
*Elantris*
and
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
you pointedly made an effort to defy certain age-old, fantasy clich√©s. What formulaic story elements did you try to redefine or avoid in the second volume of the Mistborn trilogy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*The Well of Ascension*
I focused on the concept of prophecy. So many fantasy stories involve the idea of an ancient, infallible, and comprehensible prophesy which guides the actions of the characters. In
*The Well of Ascension*
I wanted to show the dangers of relying only on prophecy to provide a guide for your life. I also wanted to turn on its head my own concept of optimism. Many fantasies, including
*Elantris*
, show that If you are just determined enough you will succeed. I wanted to deal with what happens if you believe in yourself and things go wrong anyway.
