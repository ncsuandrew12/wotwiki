# [Interview #913: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - Fantasy Book Critic, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=913#5)

#### Robert Thompson

Regarding
*Elantris*
, I read a while back that you had no intentions of writing any sequels, but then you had a change of heart. I know that you've been busy with a lot of other projects, but has there been any progress at all on a possible follow-up, or maybe ideas you could share on an
*Elantris*
sequel that have been bouncing around in your head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I doubt I will do a sequel that begins just after
*Elantris*
ends, at least not with the same characters and in the same place. There are lots of ideas I want to explore in the world of
*Elantris*
, though. I might do something about the Seons, or focus on a different culture, or write about something that happens many years after the story of
*Elantris*
.
