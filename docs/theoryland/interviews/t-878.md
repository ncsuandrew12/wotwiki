## [Entry #1](./t-878/1)

#### Austin Moore

Some somewhat minor notes of interest in the Skokie, IL book signing Q&A.

## [Entry #2](./t-878/2)

#### Austin Moore

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon stated that, as we knew before, RJ had the fates of the major characters worked out in the notes but that some had to be done by Brandon based on the current emotional moment of the story and what worked best.

## [Entry #3](./t-878/3)

#### Austin Moore

#### Brandon Sanderson

A fan asked who Nakomi was from book 13. Of course, Brandon said RAFO but that there was a clue in
*A Memory of Light*
. When I heard this I thought of when Aviendha asked Bair about Nakomi and Bair said it was an old name so I asked Brandon if that was the clue when I was at the signing table and got a RAFO as well. However, he did say that she was in the book for a reason. She was not, and he emphasized it well, not in the series just to be theorized about.

## [Entry #4](./t-878/4)

#### Austin Moore

Other than those notes of interest, and they weren't huge, there really wasn't anything new said that we didn't know before.
