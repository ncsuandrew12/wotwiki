#### Edward Henry

How much editing do your books get? Does the story or your writing get modified?

#### Robert Jordan

The story does not get modified. Occasionally the writing is modified to this extentâ€”a good editor tells you what is wrong, as another set of eyes. A good editor says, "I don't understand what you're saying here you haven't told me enough, you haven't made me believe that this person will do this or say this." And then I go back and work at making sure the editor is convinced. Remember the editor is the first reader. If the editor isn't convinced, I doubt the fans will be either.
