#### Lyndon Goodacre

I've heard that there is going to be a Wheel of Time computer game. How much are you involved in this (if it's true), and how do you feel about a game based on your work?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, it's true, it's in the works from Legend Entertainment. I'm involved to the extent that I told them I would not accept the first scenario they gave me. I told them there were certain things I wanted done in the game, such as being able to play as a female character, multiple solutions to problems, being able to get through segments without solving all the problems, and they're working on it. Apparently Glenn Dahlgren, who is designing the game, is very much in agreement with me on these things.
