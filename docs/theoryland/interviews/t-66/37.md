#### Egeanin

I was wondering if you accept fan mail...if so, how can I write to you?

Also, how many books long do you think this series will end up being? I have no objections to it being long.

#### Robert Jordan

I like receiving fan mail! Write care of TOR books, 175 Fifth Avenue, NY NY 10010. They forward fan mail to me at fairly regular intervals.

There will be a few more books, but not too many.
