#### Edward Henry

Do you have a favorite character? If so whom, and how do you avoid doing bad things to those you "love"?

#### Robert Jordan

One, my favorite character is always the one I am writing at that moment, even when I'm writing one of the Forsaken or Padan Fain. I always try to get into that character's skin, so that I can write about that character with success. As far as doing things to characters I like, well, if the story calls for bad things to happen, so shall it be. We do not all make it to the end of the road, however good or fair.
