#### Searles O'Dubhain

Speaking of illustrations, do you feel the cover illustrations to your books accurately reflect your characters and settings?

#### Robert Jordan

Probably as well as they could without me doing the drawings. There is no way that someone else can do an
illustration that gives exactly the image that is in my head. Given the limits on how much description I can give Daryl Sweet when he's doing his cover paintings, he's doing a good job. The only way to do it better is do it myself, and I have no skill there!
