#### Jim Porter

Congratulations on
*A Crown of Swords*
. It is a wonderful read. Do you find the extra several months you took to write it contributed to the overall readability of the book and actually made it shorter in
length?

#### Robert Jordan

Possibly. It was actually a good bit more in time. With the exception of
*The Eye of the World*
, which took four years to write, each of these books has taken me somewhere on the order of thirteen or fourteen months.
*A Crown of Swords*
took twenty months. There were several things I had to work out. Too much was happening and the book would have been too long. I had to work to cut things outâ€”and that's not as easy as it sounds.
