#### Moiraine Damodred

I'd like to thank you for your wonderful series. It has provided me with many hundreds of hours of
entertainment at home and at work. Are there any other fantasy authors or titles that you are particularly
fond of? Do you ever re-read your own Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

The only time I re-read is to check on something when I have to make sure of exactly what I said in a certain circumstance about a certain character or incident.

As far as the people I read, there are far too many to list...Tad Williams, Barry Hughhart, Ray Feist, it could be a very long list, but we'd be here quite a time listing authors.
