#### John

Have you ever considered making the Wheel of Time into a movie?

#### Robert Jordan

With almost every book that has come out, and certainly every one that has made the bestseller lists, there's a feeler about a movie, but it always goes away, because any one of these books would have to be a TV miniseries. There's no way that I can see to compress them into a three-hour movie or even a four-hour movie. That's not to say it won't happen, but I don't really expect it.
