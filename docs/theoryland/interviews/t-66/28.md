# [Interview #66: Compuserve Chat, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=66#28)

#### Ammon

Have you ever put your own personality in one of your characters, or do you liken yourself to one of your characters?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I expect there's a bit of me in all of the male characters. My secretary thinks that I am Mat. My wife thinks I'm Loial. Other people have said they detected me in other characters, but I think it's just a bit of me in all of the male characters. I'm not sure how I could have written them otherwise.

#### Footnote

It's not clear whether RJ's 'secretary' is Maria or Marcia Warnock. (Marcia seems more likely as RJ generally referred to Maria as his 'assistant'. She started working for him about this time.)
