#### Ryssgarde

You include a glossary in every novel. Any chance we'll see a companion book with EVERY term defined? How about prequels to this series?

#### Robert Jordan

The possibility of a companion book with all the terms defined is fairly strongâ€”once the series is done of course!

As far as prequels, that would depend entirely on my coming up with a story I'd like to tell that is set there. It's not enough to say, "I just want to write what came before this." I tell the history of this world in great detail already. I will add that we're putting together an illustrated guide which will include some things that are not in the books such as the story of Arthur Hawkwing's rise and fall.
