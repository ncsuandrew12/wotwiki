#### Seanchaâ€™

What are your days like and how do you discipline yourself to write? Is it something you only do when the mood strikes, or do you work at a page, despite it not really flowing, and then edit like hell later?

#### Robert Jordan

A writer who waits for the mood or the muse to strike will starve to death because he or she won't write very much. I write almost every day, I would say every day, but occasionally I actually do something else. My typical day is to have breakfast, answer the phone calls I have to answer, deal with the letters, and then I sit down and start writing. I then write for at least the next eight hours straight, and sometimes ten or twelve or more. Though I do occasionally take a day off to go fishing, my usual week is seven days.
