#### Searles O'Dubhain

I noticed that your other pen name is Sean O'Neal. Did you draw Mat's "Band of the Red Hand" from family stories?

#### Robert Jordan

No. That came from my mind twisting certain mythologies that I had read, certain legends.

#### Footnote

The pseudonym is actually Reagan O'Neal, not Sean O'Neal.
