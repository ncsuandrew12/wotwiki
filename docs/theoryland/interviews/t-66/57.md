#### Searles O'Dubhain

The initiation rituals for raising an Accepted to Aes Sedai seem to be based upon some sort of real-life ceremonies. Where did you get the idea for the three passes through the
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Trinities and threes and multiples of three or seven turn up again and again in mythologies and legends throughout the world and in ceremonies throughout the world. That part is hardly original. It's something that speaks to us on some deeper level. It's so prevalent, it must. It's all pervasive.

#### Footnote

The 'three passes through the
*ter'angreal*
' corresponds to the way in which a novice is raised to Accepted, not how an Accepted is raised Aes Sedai.
