#### Eric Ligner

With the scope of this work, it must have been on your mind for a long time. When did you first conceive the story and how many years after that was the first book published?

#### Robert Jordan

I had the first notions for this book, I guess it was 1975 or '76. For these books I should say. But there were a lot of things to think out, a lot of changes I went through. For instance the character of Rand and Tam were originally one. I spent about ten years noodling the story around in the back of my head before I ever put words on paper, but that's rather typical for me. My books have a fairly long gestation period.
