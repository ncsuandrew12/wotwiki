Are we going to see Moiraine again? Lanfear?

My wife would like to know why none of the main characters have any children. Are there any in their future?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. Most of the main characters are both very young and unmarried. Even some of the older ones are unmarriedâ€”so they have no kids, but read and find out. We'll see what happens.
