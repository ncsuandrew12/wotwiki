Are we going to see Moiraine again? Lanfear?

My wife would like to know why none of the main characters have any children. Are there any in their future?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. Most of the main characters are both very young and unmarried. Even some of the older ones are unmarried—so they have no kids, but read and find out. We'll see what happens.
