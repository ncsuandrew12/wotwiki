#### Matt Campbell

Which of the books did you enjoy writing the most and which was the biggest let-down?

#### Robert Jordan

None of them has been a let-down. And I always enjoy the book that I'm writing the most. I do try to make each book better than the last one I've done. When I've finished with a book, I'm on to enjoying the next one, and working on the next one.
