#### Martin Reznick

Does your world have defined natural laws in terms of: the One Power, the True Power, the weather, etc., or do you make them up as you go along?

#### Robert Jordan

There are set laws—there have to be—if you write stories where anything can happen, they get flabby, you lose focus. I have certain set laws and limits on the One Power, the True Power, and all of this. And these limits and laws come out in pieces, they are not the focus of the stories so they only come out in bits and pieces.
