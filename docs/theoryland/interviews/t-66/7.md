#### Edward Henry

Mr. Jordan: How do you create the personalities for your main characters? What inspires you to help make your people believably different?

#### Robert Jordan

I sit down and do a sort of descriptive sketch of each character. What do they believe about certain things? What do they like to do, and what do they not like to do? It's very useful as long as I make sure that a character continues to react as they would. The fault, the mistake is to decide to make a character behave or speak in a certain way because you need it to happen in the story...and the devil with whether the character would do or say that.
