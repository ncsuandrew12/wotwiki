#### Dawn Rosen

Thank you—I've really enjoyed the series and look forward to reading your current book. I'm having trouble placing the amount of time that has gone by since the early days when the Aes Sedai came to the Two Rivers. How long has it been? Also, will Nynaeve and Lan ever get together, face to face?

#### Robert Jordan

It's about two years since the beginning. Roughly—very roughly. As to them getting together, read and find out, my dear, read and find out (he chuckled richly).
