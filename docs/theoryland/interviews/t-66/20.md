#### Karl Schwede

First I'd like to thank you for such a wonderful series. I'm curious about something, do you ever look at some of things people theorize about your books, in your newsgroup for example? Do you ever look to see how close other people's theories are?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, but only when someone sends me a FAQ. Sometimes someone will send me a print out of the latest FAQ from the latest source, or send it on disk (it helps if I can access it through Wordperfect 5.1). Generally these things divide up evenly...a third of the answers are right, a third are almost right, and a third are very off-the-wall.
