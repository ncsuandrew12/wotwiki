# [Interview #66: Compuserve Chat, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=66#39)

#### Ha T. Nguyen

I really like the romance in your stories and I was wondering if you could tell us how and where you met your wife (if it's not too personal) and, also, if she ever pulled a Moiraine/Lan on you, i.e., pouring ice water over you while you slept?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I met my wife—the actual story is very long and complicated—but I met her because she had come back to Charleston to set up her own publishing company and I was in the process of quitting my engineering job to write. As far as the ice water, no, she has never poured ice water over my head, but she has made motions toward my belly button with a paring knife. She says this is wholly unconscious. I have my doubts.
