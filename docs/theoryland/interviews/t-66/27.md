#### Steven D. Salisbury

Why introduce a somewhat important character like Cadsuane so late in the series? Is the fact that it seems a little odd supposed to be a clue?

#### Robert Jordan

She's introduced late in the series because this is the place where she was supposed to come in. I didn't expect her to be a part earlier in the seriesâ€”there was nothing for her to do! We introduce no character before her time. With apologies to Orson Welles.
