#### Jeff Jarrell

What made you decide to make male Aes Sedai go insane versus female Aes Sedai using magic somewhat safely?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm not sure about the last of that question, but this was part of the basis, the foundation of the story. If women had gone insane using the power and not men, it would be a much different world, a much different story, and not the story I was interested in writing!
