#### David Berenthal

Considering all the work you've been through already, you'll probably hate this question, but when can we expect the next book, and how many more do you expect?

Will you be writing any other books that are similar fantasy/fiction?

#### Robert Jordan

First, I expect to deliver the next book in the fall of next year, which means that it will probably be published in the spring of 1998.

I do not know how many more books there will be. There will be at least ten total, probably more...but the safest way to say that is to say "there will be a few more, not too many, and please god not as many as have already been written!"

Other books? Not until I finish the Wheel of Time. I am already working in my head on what I'll do after that. It is indeed a fantasy series. I have a long gestation period for my books. The Wheel of Time gestated for at least ten years before it appeared on paper, and Shipwreck seems to be doing at least that.
