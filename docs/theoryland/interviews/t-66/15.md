#### Eric Ligner

I like your use of strong female characters. Was there any inspiration for this?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, I grew up in a family of strong women. Most of the women I knew growing up were quite strong. I very early on realized thatâ€”well, it seemed natural, this is how I saw the world. There were strong women and strong men and when weak men came along they were ridden over. But the fact that there were strong women didn't mean no strong men. Again, it's a given, there had to be a balance.
