#### Hopper

Speaking of book signings, is there a tour in the works? If so, when?

#### Robert Jordan

Not for
*A Crown of Swords*
per se. There is a tour in the fall, I don't know exactly when, for the reprinting of some of my historical novels. It looks as though that will be expanded to include some areas where I normally wouldn't appear for those, to make it a partial tour for
*A Crown of Swords*
. The Tor Books website will give details (and so will Book Preview).
