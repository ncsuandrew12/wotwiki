#### Mark

Mr. Jordan: I like the fact that the main characters are a little unsure of themselves about how to proceed in their world, particularly Rand. Instead, the traditional "superhuman" is Lan, who plays a background role thus far. Will we see more of him?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, some more.
