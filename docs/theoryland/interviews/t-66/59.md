#### Lyndon Goodacre

It seems to me many authors say they write because the books they wanted to read hadn't been written yet. Is this true in your case?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, I suppose it might be. If I were just a tad lazier of course, I could quite happily sit back and read other people's stories forever. The truth of the matter is that I have these stories that I'd like to tell. If someone had gotten there ahead of me, I might never have written. Or, who knows, I might have found I had another set of stories to tell that no one had written.
