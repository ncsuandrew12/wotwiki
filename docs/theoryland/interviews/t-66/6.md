#### Lyndon Goodacre

First, I'd like to thank you for such a great series. The Wheel of Time is probably the best I've read... My
Question: Do you know roughly what will happen between now (Book 7) and the last scene of the last book, or are you making it up as you go along?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes and no. I know the last scene of the last book. I know the major events I want to happen between now
and then. I know who will be alive and who will be dead at the end of the series. I know the situation of the world. I know all of those things, but I leave how to get from one point to the next free...so that I can achieve some fluidity. I don't want it too rigid, which is what I think will happen if I plan in too great a detail.
