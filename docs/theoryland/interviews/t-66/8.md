#### James Tillett

Being English, I cannot help but notice that you are very much centered in the US. Bearing this in mind, do you consider yourself an international author who is based in America or an American author who just happens to have an international following?

#### Robert Jordan

I would have to say I'm an American author, and more specifically that I'm a Southern author. My voice is both very American and very Southern. I've been lucky in that people in a great many nations seem to enjoy that voice, though.
