#### D. John Witherspoon

In the first five books, the pace of the story, switching between character situations and the action in
general was high speed and covered significant periods of time. In
*Lord of Chaos*
, the story seemed to slow. Was this intentional or only my perception?

#### Robert Jordan

It covered a shorter period of time, but in
*Lord of Chaos*
and
*A Crown of Swords*
there were a great many things that happen in a short time that made it necessary to have the books, if not slower paced from the reader's point of view, slower as far as the chronology is concerned.
