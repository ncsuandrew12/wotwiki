#### Charles W. Otten

Mr. Jordan, I think your series is the most detailed and still the most broad in scope series currently running. How do you keep everything straight? Also, how many books do you see in the future before this "series" of the Wheel is done turning?

#### Robert Jordan

I keep detailed files on every character, every nation, every culture, every facet of the world I can imagine. If I printed out all of the manuscripts of all the of the books, and all of the notes, there would be twice as many pages of notes...and of course that doesn't encompass the great quantity of things I have tucked away in my head, so solidly fitted there I feel no need to put them in the notes.
