#### Lexie

Will there be other crossover characters like Hoid?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There already have been.

#### LEXIE

Really?

#### BRANDON SANDERSONM

Yes.

#### LEXIE

Can you tell?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I cannot say more than that, I think that they’re placed quite obviously, they were not very obvious before this book, they do exist, other crossovers do exist. But none so obvious as Hoid. I think there are several obvious ones in this novel, no one has yet found them that I know, but I think once they see them- once you look closely they’re there
