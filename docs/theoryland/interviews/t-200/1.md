# [Interview #200: Atlanta Signing Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=200#1)

#### Jennifer Liang

Robert Jordan was signing books today at the Chapter 11 store at the intersection of Peachtree Road and Peachtree Battle. I arrived early with my husband and a box of leftover goodies from Dragon\*Con that we wanted to get rid of. For those who don't know, Tor sent us 900 sample booklets of
*Knife of Dreams*
and
*The Eye of the World*
, and 2,000
*Knife of Dreams*
bookmarks. We still had quite a few left after the convention and we don't want to store that many, so everyone who attended the signing got to take some of those with them.

The bookstore policy was that Jordan would sign only two books and they had to be purchased from the store. However, Jordan immediately brushed that aside and signed anything you put in front of him and as much as you gave him. He even did a few personalizations upon request for people.

Since the signing wasn't very well advertised (I found out about it from the Jordans on the last day of Dragon\*Con), turnout was low. I was the "flapper" for Jordan. That's the person who opens all the books to the right page for signing so that the author can sign more quickly. If you were there, I was the girl in the green and brown suit and my husband Jimmy was the Asian man in gray talking about sword forms.
