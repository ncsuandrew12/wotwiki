# [Interview #200: Atlanta Signing Report - Jennifer Liang, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=200#2)

#### Jennifer Liang

There were no startling plot revelations from Jordan this time. The only questions asked were personal or repeats of questions asked at Dragon\*Con or previous interviews, so I don't need to repeat much of it.

#### Robert Jordan

There is only one book left in the series but it will be a doozy. He will fight to prevent it from being "George R.R. Martined," or split for publication. He plans to do a signing in Anchorage, Alaska for
*Knife of Dreams*
, but it will be during the salmon season so he can do some serious fishing while there.
