# [Interview #135: Dromen and Demonen Chat, Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=135#41)

#### Rand

Mister Jordan, what do you think about the short movie that they're going to make about Lews Therin breaking the world (I read it on the Dragonmount site). Do you approve that idea?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't know anything about someone making a short movie about Lews Therin breaking the world, but if someone intends that they better talk to me first. I know lawyers who eat shotgun shells for breakfast.
