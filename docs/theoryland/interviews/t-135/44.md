# [Interview #135: Dromen and Demonen Chat, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=135#44)

#### Indy

I'll try this question again: I really hope you have a long and happy life, but have you taken any precautions for the finishing of WOT in case something happens to you?

#### Robert Jordan

I have not only not taken precautions to make sure that TWOT is finished by someone else than me, I have made that as difficult as possible. So if you want to see the end of TWOT, you wish that I live a long and healthy life guys!
