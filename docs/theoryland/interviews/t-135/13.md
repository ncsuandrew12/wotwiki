#### Punisher

Mr. Jordan, my question is not directly related to your books. I wrote one myself, and I am working through an online company to make it available until I can get it published properly. Through this company, I'm hoping to get a copy in your hands. Will you read it if they get you one? And perhaps review it?

#### Robert Jordan

Sorry, I really just don't have time to read manuscripts.
