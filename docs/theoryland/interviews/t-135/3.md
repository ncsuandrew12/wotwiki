#### Question

How many books will there be, and when's the next one published? Are you related to Michael Jordan?

#### Robert Jordan

There will be at least three more books. The next book will be in bookstores very shortly after I finish writing it, and Michael Jordan is my kid brother whom I taught to play basketball.
