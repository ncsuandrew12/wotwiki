#### Medin-Sedai

Maybe this is a stupid question, too: but you told us that when you had your first thoughts about Wheel of Time, Tam and Rand al'Thor were the same person. Now I have a question about Nynaeve. When you first thought about her, was she the same person as she is now? (Did you already think about her tugging her braid???) P.S.: You won't answer this one I think: but was it Demandred who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

Nynaeve in the beginning was actually going to be the love interest for Rand/Tam, but she was the same kind of womanâ€”quickly temperamental and not suffering fools gladly.
