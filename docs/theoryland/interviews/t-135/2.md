#### Sander

The Prophecies of the Dragon are a fair-sized book. Do the prophecies of the Sea Folk, the 'Jendai Prophecy', have a similar size, or is it much smaller? And who or what is or was 'Jendai'?

#### Robert Jordan

The Jendai prophecies are smaller in length but similar in scope to the Dragon prophecies but limited to the Sea Folk.
