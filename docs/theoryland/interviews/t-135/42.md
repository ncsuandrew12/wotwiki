Are there any dragons (like real dragons (=animals)) in Rand's world? If not where did they get the idea of dragons?

#### Robert Jordan

There are no animal dragons of any kind in this world. The people speak of a man called the Dragon. They know that the banner that has a certain creature on it was the banner of this man and they have taken to calling this creature the dragon. To them it is a simple association with the name of this man.
