Do the 'lesser' characters in the books have any real significance in driving the story forward, or are they just there for packing? I like them myself, but many on the sites seem not to. Are they there just to add a touch of relief from the main players?

#### Robert Jordan

The lesser characters usually have real significance in driving the story forward. I am not talking about someone who appears for four pages and then vanishes, but secondary and tertiary characters have real purposes.
