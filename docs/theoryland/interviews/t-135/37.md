#### Malivar

If a Fade's blade will not produce lightning except against other Thakandar-wrought blades, and power-wrought blades, why do Thom's daggers produce it when he attacks the Fade at Whitebridge?

#### Robert Jordan

Thom's daggers did not produce the effect. It was produced before Thom reached the Fade.
