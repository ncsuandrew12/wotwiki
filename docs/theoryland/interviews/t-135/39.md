How come the first character you came up with isn't a 30-year-old Rand any more? When did this change?

#### Robert Jordan

The first character I came up was not a 30-year-old Rand, it was that the first version of Rand was a 30-year-old man. I changed that because I wanted the character of Rand to find everything beyond his village to be strange and new.
