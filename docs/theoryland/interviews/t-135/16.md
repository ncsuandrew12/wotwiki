# [Interview #135: Dromen and Demonen Chat, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=135#16)

#### RV\_NL

What exactly are Mat's memories, are they from his ancestors, as they all seem to be connected to Manetheren?

#### Robert Jordan

Mat's memories are NOT from his ancestors. He said I want to have the holes in his head filled, but he did not specify exactly what he wanted them filled with, and so he received scraps and bits and pieces of memories stolen from other men.

#### Footnote

RJ is obviously talking about the memories Mat received from the Eelfinn, so this quote does not rule out Old Blood as an explanation for the Aemon memories in
*The Dragon Reborn*
Chapter 19 (before Mat ever visited the Aelfinn or the Eelfinn), nor does the
['Glimmers' interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=5#13)
rule out past life memories as an explanation.
