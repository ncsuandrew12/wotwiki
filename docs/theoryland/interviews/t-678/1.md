According to Valeria Ciocci, who is the [Italian] translator, the next book should be out around November, but much depends on how fast the translation goes. However Fanucci's intentions are to publish two books every year, while Jordan has said that the series will include a total of 12 volumes. In addition there will be three prequels.

#### Robert Jordan

One is
*New Spring*
, which was published in reduced form in the book
*Legends*
2. Actually, Silverberg had asked Jordan to write a story for
*Legends*
, but Jordan wrote a novel. Since it was too long to be included in the anthology he shortened it considerably, and the result was what we were able to read even in Italy. When Jordan's American publisher learned of this story, he asked Jordan if he couldn’t expand it into a novel.

One of the other two prequels (Jordan said he will write them only after he has finished narrating the events in the saga) covers Tam al'Thor and his decision to leave the army to retire to the Two Rivers. The other, I don’t remember.
