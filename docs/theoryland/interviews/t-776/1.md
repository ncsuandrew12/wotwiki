# [Interview #776: TWOK Signing Report - rew, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=776#1)

#### rew

I talked personally to Brandon today (September 18) at a book signing at the Orem Barnes & Noble.

I asked him two questions, both about "The Seven-Striped Lass." He "accused" me of working for Dragonmount or Theoryland, but said that I could report back to them on what he said. Sadly, I didn't have a recording device with me, so his answers aren't verbatim, but the words in quotations are the words that he used and the content is what I remember him saying. If there are mistakes they are probably mine, not his, as I am only human and cannot fully reproduce a spoken conversation word for word hours after the fact (despite the notes I jotted down).
