#### Question

Why did he choose to release Chapter 8 [of
*Towers of Midnight*
]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said it was strategic, because he knew that the prologue would be up for sale, and chapters 1 and 2 would be up for free on Tor's site. As well, chapters 3, 4 etc. wouldn't have worked "because they build upon each other. Chapter 1 builds on the Prologue, Chapter 2 on Chapter 1, etc." And thus, chapter 8 was the earliest chapter that would work as a teaser without spoiling earlier things or getting in the way of the other early releases. He also confirmed that, yes, chapter 8 is the first Mat POV in the book.
