# [Interview #368: Rolling up the Wheel of Time Panel, WorldCon, Denver, CO - Peter Ahlstrom, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=368#2)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

On Saturday, August 9th, I had the privilege to take part in the Rolling up the Wheel of Time panel at the
[World Science Fiction Convention in Denver](http://www.denvention3.org/)
. I had thought some podcaster would probably record this panel, but apparently that didnâ€™t happen. The following is a somewhat cleaned up semi-stream-of-consciousness reconstruction of the panel from the copious notes I took throughout.
