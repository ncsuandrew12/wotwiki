# [Interview #368: Rolling up the Wheel of Time Panel, WorldCon, Denver, CO - Peter Ahlstrom, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=368#17)

#### Question

There’s a question from the audience about the pronunciation of Nyneave; the audience member says that years ago he heard Robert Jordan in a panel pronounce her name as “nih NAH veh” but Brandon said “nigh NEEV.”

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon says he tends to use a lot of the pronunciations from the audio books, and Tom says that since Jim approved the audio books, their pronunciations are probably the way to go. Brandon says that he once asked how Morgase was pronounced and got three different answers—from Harriet, Maria, and Alan, and they’re supposed to know!
