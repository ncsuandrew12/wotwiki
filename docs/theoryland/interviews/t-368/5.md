# [Interview #368: Rolling up the Wheel of Time Panel, WorldCon, Denver, CO - Peter Ahlstrom, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=368#5)

#### Tom Doherty

Tom loved Brandon’s book
*Elantris*
and liked Mistborn even more. While Jim was originally against anyone else writing Wheel of Time books, toward the end of his life he became convinced that since he would not be able to finish the last book, someone else needed to. Tom calls The Wheel of Time a series that “will be read for generations,” and he says, “We’ll be proud of Brandon’s work going forward.” Tom mentions that Jim also planned to eventually write some books taking place about 10 years after
*A Memory of Light*
that would mostly focus on Mat and Tuon [the books known as the outrigger novels].
