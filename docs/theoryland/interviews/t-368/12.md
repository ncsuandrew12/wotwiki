# [Interview #368: Rolling up the Wheel of Time Panel, WorldCon, Denver, CO - Peter Ahlstrom, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=368#12)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

By this time a lot of the questions I gathered from the fans have already been answered just in the course of the discussion; I ask Tom one that’s left. “Will the dedication page at the beginning of
*A Memory of Light*
be for Robert Jordan himself, or will there be some sort of tribute to the original author in the book?”

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tom and Brandon both answer that all the previous books were dedicated by Robert Jordan to Harriet, and they’re sure RJ and Harriet wouldn’t have it any other way for this book. However, Tom says there could be something like an explanatory introduction written by Harriet. We’ll see.
