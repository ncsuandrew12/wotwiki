#### Question

There’s a question from the audience about the remaining two prequels besides
*New Spring*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon answers that the decision on whether or not those ever get written is completely up to Harriet. Brandon is not even thinking about those at this point; he does, after all, have his own books to write after he finishes up
*A Memory of Light*
. But then if Harriet does ask him to write the prequels—he’ll say yes, because after all, he still doesn’t want anyone else doing it.
