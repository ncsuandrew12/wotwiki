#### Question

“What do you do to keep sane?”

#### Brandon Sanderson

He writes. It relaxes him. Brandon’s wife hadn’t read the series beyond
*The Eye of the World*
, which is something that needed to be corrected! Brandon says that the response from the fan community has been generally positive—with only two death threats so far! He gets two to three dozen e-mails per day wishing him luck. A common refrain from the series is: “You will do well.” Brandon is putting in long hours working on this book. He feels like he’s a medical student working on his residency. He and his wife often sit in the same room working on different things while he writes—they’re together, but they’re in different worlds.
