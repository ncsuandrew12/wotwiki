# [Interview #368: Rolling up the Wheel of Time Panel, WorldCon, Denver, CO - Peter Ahlstrom, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=368#6)

#### Moshe Feder

Moshe then asks Brandon how he got involved in
*The Wheel of Time*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon says his story starts when he was in 8th grade (in 1989?). He wasn’t a reader. For a school book report, he wanted to do a
*Three Investigators*
novel he’d read years before. [Hey, some of those books are excellent!] His teacher gave him a book and said to do his report on it instead—that was
*Dragonsbane*
by Barbara Hambly. Brandon’s reaction upon reading the book: “Somebody’s writing books for me!” After this he started devouring every fantasy he could get his hands on.

The next year was 1990, and Brandon saw the
*Eye of the World*
paperback in the bookstore and was immediately drawn by the cover, which he believes is the best cover Darrell Sweet has done. And the page count made him say, “I have to have that one! It’s so big!” When he started reading the book, the level of complexity made Brandon’s mind spin—in a good way. Also, Rand, Mat, and Perrin were his same age, which made him more interested in their story.
