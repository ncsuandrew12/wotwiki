*A Memory of Light*
did indeed
[hit #1 on the
*New York Times*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/01/a-memory-of-light-debuts-at-1-on-the-new-york-times-bestseller-list)
bestseller list for hardcover fiction. It also hit #1 on the
*USA Today*
list, which is much harder, since the

list covers all print books, whatever the format, whether fiction or nonfiction. That's the sendoff we had hoped to be able to deliver for Robert Jordan's legacy. I'm honored to have been involved. Thank you to all the readers who made this a reality, and I hope you're enjoying the book.
