Pat Rothfuss's
[Worldbuilders](http://teamheifer.heifer.org/worldbuilders2012)
charity drive runs until midnight tonight Central time. Today is the last chance to donate this year, with a good chance to win a cool donated book.
[The latest batch](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2013/01/even-yet-more-author-donated-books/)
includes a signed leatherbound copy of my novella
*Legion*
. By the way, last week's
[*The Gathering Storm*
auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Gathering-Storm-set-Hardcover-1st-1st-signed-by-Brandon-Sanderson-2-pins-/181060571127?pt=US_Fiction_Books&hash=item2a280d0ff7)
went for $300. This week's
*Legion*
just goes into the general pool of prizes for people who donate $10 on the
[Heifer International](http://teamheifer.heifer.org/worldbuilders2012)
page. (Each additional $10 donation gets you another ticket in the drawing.)
