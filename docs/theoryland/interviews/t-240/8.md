# [Interview #240: KOD Signing Report - Caychris, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=240#8)

#### Caychris

All in all I found RJ very captivating as a person. I hung around while he signed stock books when nearly everyone had gone and just listened to some of his observations on his and other writer's fans and anything else that came up.

The book store staff were wonderful and helped me find some stuff I'd been looking for. Martin is going to be there on the 18th, so I'm thinking about going there as well.

If I remember anything else I'll be sure to post it.
