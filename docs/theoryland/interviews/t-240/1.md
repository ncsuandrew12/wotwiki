# [Interview #240: KOD Signing Report - Caychris, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=240#1)

#### Caychris

This was a fairly well attended event at a rather small book store. Since this was my first book signing ever I didn't know what to expect except what I've read about the others.

#### Robert Jordan

He did give a small speech concerning the same news and events about book twelve, the new series, the prequels, and the possibility of a couple of one-off stories outside of the main characters. He went over some pronunciation.
