# [Interview #240: KOD Signing Report - Caychris, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=240#5)

#### Caychris

Then someone who came in late asked the question. [about who killed Asmodean]

#### Robert Jordan

RJ wound up with a fist like he was going to punch him, and the groan that had run through the store turned to laughter.

He reiterated why he isn't telling, and that he has tried to place a few clues in the latter books. He said that if occasion permits in the last book, and it seems appropriate, the character doing the deed will probably think to themselves about killing Asmodean. However he gave no guarantee. But he did say he will reveal Asmodean's killer if he doesn't in the book before the paperback of book 12 comes out.

He also went on to mention that there is one website that gets it right with a very complete listing of the suspects with motives and facts that gets it right. He wasn't going to tell us which one. He said they got the right 'why' as well, and they used only facts in prior to the murder. I later asked him if he could say when he found out about the website and he said he couldn't remember, but it was quite some time ago.
