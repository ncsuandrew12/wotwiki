# [Interview #364: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Denver Followup and AMoL Update, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=364#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you all for your responses. I did mange to get a book signing set up for the weekend before Worldcon! It will be at the Lone Tree Barnes and Noble in Lone Tree, CO. (Which is part of the greater Denver metro area.) Specifics are:

Saturday, August 2nd from 2:00-4:00 PM

Shoppes at the Meadows
  
8374 S. Willow Street
  
Lone Tree, CO 80124
  
303-706-9660

I'll post a reminder on the blog when it gets closer to the date, and I may actually try to set something else up as well at an independent bookseller.
