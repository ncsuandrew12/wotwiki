# [Interview #364: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Denver Followup and AMoL Update, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=364#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've finished through my big revision of the first section of
*A Memory of Light*
that I have done, but I'm leaving the percentage bar at 50%. I plan to turn my attention to writing the next chunk of the book, but will leave this simmering, and probably read through it one more time at the end of the month. I know that Mr. Jordan never let people read his material until he'd done several drafts, and I want to have at least read this over once more before sending it to Harriet.
