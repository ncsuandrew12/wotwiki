#### Brandon Sanderson

Other news and notes: New Writing Excuses is up. This week,
[we talk about how to be both a businessperson and an artist](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/04/21/writing-excuses-episode-11-business-of-writing/)
. This is the second of two episodes we did where we were having microphone issues, FYI. it still sounds just fine, and you can hear all of us, but we had to use a center microphone rather than individual ones. We'll be back to the old way next week, so don't worry.

My pal
[Brandon Mull](http://brandonmull.com/)
, the other Brandon writing fantasy in the Utah area, just released his new book. It's the
[third in the Fablehaven series](http://www.amazon.com/Fablehaven-Grip-Shadow-Plague/dp/1590388984/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208818576&sr=8-1)
. Congrats, Brandon!
