# [Interview #613: PolarisCon Report - herid, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=613#6)

#### herid

I asked about Galad and his parallels with Mordred that I
[discussed here](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/blog/110/entry-1320-galad-as-mordred/)
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He started nodding before I finished describing the parallels and said that yes, he was aware of those. But he of course didn't say anything specific about how exactly this might play out. He did say that he has much less freedom with Galad than with some other characters as Galad's plotline was mapped out in detail by RJ.
