# [Interview #613: PolarisCon Report - herid, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=613#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that up until the last few weeks of his life RJ didn't want anybody to finish the books in case he died and even wanted all the notes, outlines etc destroyed. He only changed his mind a few weeks before his death. I suspect he mentioned this in prior interviews but this was the first I've heard about it myself.
