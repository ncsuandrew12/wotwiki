# [Interview #613: PolarisCon Report - herid, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=613#5)

#### herid

I asked him whether the second method to destroy
*cuendillar*
(the first is True Power) can be figured out based on available info and the laws of the world of WoT.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he doesn't think so but that the method is such that when/if we see it we should feel that it does conform to the rules of the WoT universe. Unfortunately, I can't recall his exact wording but I don't think the way he said implied that we would definitely see it happen.

#### Footnote

Brandon
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#14)
that the second way to destroy
*cuendillar*
is by weakening the Pattern. (The first way is with the True Power, as we saw in
*The Gathering Storm*
.
