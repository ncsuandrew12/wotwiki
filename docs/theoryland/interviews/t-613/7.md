# [Interview #613: PolarisCon Report - herid, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=613#7)

#### herid

I also asked him again (
[Terez asked him about it on my behalf before](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#32)
) about why Taim when he first shows up in
*Lord of Chaos*
says that he shaved because of the heat, yet it's mentioned twice in that very scene that he is not sweating and he later teaches Rand the antisweating trick and tells him that it works so well that Rand would soon be able to completely ignore even extreme heat and cold. I
[discuss this in detail in my blog](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/blog/110/entry-1158-taim-is-an-impostor/)
as I believe it proves that Taim is an impostor.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that this issue is not discussed in the notes and he missed it himself previously so the best he can say is that this is meant to show that Taim is a suspicious character who is not to be trusted.

#### herid

This doesn't exactly lend support to my theory but I don't think it contradicts it either. I didn't ask him if this proves that Taim is an impostor as he'd RAFO that.
