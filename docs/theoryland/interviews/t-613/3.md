# [Interview #613, Entry #3]: PolarisCon Report - herid](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=613#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that the scene with the Borderlander farmers in
*The Gathering Storm*
prologue and the one with the Borderlander Watch Tower in the
*Towers of Midnight*
prologue were written by RJ and that they were some of the last complete scenes RJ wrote (he mentioned this in earlier interviews).

He refused to say who wrote "The Last That Could Be Done" from
*The Gathering Storm*
.

He wrote the scenes of Egwene's dinners with Elaida in
*The Gathering Storm*
. RJ's notes suggested just one dinner scene but BS decided that it would work better if it was split in two.

#### Footnote

Brandon said
[at a signing](#5)
that he did write "The Last that Could Be Done" (which is chapter 22 of
*The Gathering Storm*
). He might have started with something RJ wrote, but it's not likely, as he has
[indicated](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#2)
that most of what RJ did in this book was in the prologue and in the Egwene bits.
