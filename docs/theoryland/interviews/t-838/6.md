# [Interview #838: DragonCon 2012 - AMOL Update Report, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=838#6)

#### Chris Lough

#### Brandon Sanderson

When an audience member asked the author what scene from the entire series really stuck with him, Brandon provided three that were particularly resonant; his favorite being when Rand visits Rhuidean. A close runner-up was the sequence at the end of
*A Crown of Swords*
, where Nynaeve loses her block and Lan rushes to her aid. And another reliable favorite for Brandon? Perrin during the siege of the Two Rivers in
*The Shadow Rising*
.
