#### Chris Lough

The discussion of multiple viewpoints prompted one audience member to ask about the growing amount of secondary viewpoints in the series itself, most notably in the prologues.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon pointed that Jordan himself began that trend in the prologues; "Embers Falling on Dry Grass" being among Sanderson's favorite uses of that device, and revealed that readers should expect even more in the final volume.

How many more?

Upwards of 80. In a single chapter. Thatâ€™s around 70,000 words and which takes place near the end of
*A Memory of Light*
. (We're very curious to see if that chapter is titled "Tarmon Gai'don.")
