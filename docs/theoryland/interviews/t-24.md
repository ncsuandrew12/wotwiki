## [Entry #2](./t-24/2)

#### Robert Jordan

Easing the Badger: An in joke between RJ and wife. "A ceremony."

## [Entry #3](./t-24/3)

#### Robert Jordan

Chicago: "In Chicago, the bookstores were recommending hotels. They doubled their book order."

## [Entry #4](./t-24/4)

#### Robert Jordan

Covers: Rand originally had Darrel K. Sweet's build. Finally he's tall enough. The monkey girl is Egwene. "They're fine." (the covers)

## [Entry #5](./t-24/5)

#### Robert Jordan

World Design: about 10 years before writing commenced. Stopped being a nuclear engineer to write.

## [Entry #6](./t-24/6)

#### Robert Jordan

Tam and Rand: Originally same character—the soldier comes home to a small town. He is
*not*
Farstrider. He is a blademaster and Second Captain in Illian.

## [Entry #7](./t-24/7)

#### Robert Jordan

Red Ajah: not all lesbians—just manhaters. RJ knows non-manhating lesbians. Not based at all on Agnes Scott girls. Based on some girls he knew as a child.

All women in Randland—based on his wife. "Does she tug her hair?" "No. Mine."

## [Entry #8](./t-24/8)

#### Robert Jordan

Verin: "I don't know what she'd drink but I drink very strong coffee in the morning and tea in the afternoon and evenings." (A description of exactly how strong the coffee is followed.)

## [Entry #9](./t-24/9)

#### Robert Jordan

Girl at Citadel: "She is a liar. She and the guidance counselor deliberately whited out all references to her gender." (Followed by about 10 minutes of impassioned talk about how running in combat boots saved his life in Vietnam—fascinating, touching and irreproducible.)

## [Entry #10](./t-24/10)

#### Robert Jordan

Sniffs and Snorts—you have to decide which sounds sound like what. "Siuan snorts". (Why do women sniff and men snort?)

## [Entry #11](./t-24/11)

#### Robert Jordan

How many books?—"I don't know. Two, maybe three, maybe four. I know the last scene. But after I write the last scene that is all there is for these characters." (No Eddings sequels) "Maybe a series in another Age."

What other books?—"More books planned than I have years to write them."

## [Entry #12](./t-24/12)

#### Robert Jordan

Language—It is planned. Based on Russian, Chinese and a bit of Spanish with a lot of Gaelic thrown in.

Cultures of influence—he's real big on Chinese history right now.

Why the swords?—As in Japan, gunpowder is suppressed so martial arts are developed and are based on the sword and on agricultural implements.

## [Entry #13](./t-24/13)

#### Question

When did you start reading?

#### Robert Jordan

Age four. Started with
*The Letters of Thomas Jefferson*
and
*Forever Amber*
. After, when he got a library card, he found the children's section extremely limiting.

## [Entry #14](./t-24/14)

#### Question

Will we see Jain Farstrider?

#### Robert Jordan

Read the books. If he's not seen by the last page, he's not in there.

## [Entry #15](./t-24/15)

#### Question

The dagger—could Mat have chosen anything else?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, but he wouldn't be Mat then, would he? A dagger would attract him more than a chalice or whatever. It's easy to stick it in the belt.

## [Entry #16](./t-24/16)

#### Question

Is Bela
*ta'veren*
?

#### Robert Jordan

He quoted John Novak's Darkfriend Social scene. (He called it the "Darkfriend Social". He got the name from Judy.)

## [Entry #17](./t-24/17)

#### Question

Do you get to keep your frequent flier miles on this tour?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. And he's going to Sweden next year for the Swedish sci-fi convention.

## [Entry #18](./t-24/18)

#### Question

Are the sword forms based on reality?

#### Robert Jordan

Sort of based on Taekwondo and Karate—but from books, not experience.

## [Entry #19](./t-24/19)

#### Question

Isn't
*Lord of Chaos*
half of a book?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. He wanted to experiment. There's something else which is experimental, but he won't say what.

#### Footnote

I asked Erica about this concept that
*Lord of Chaos*
is 'half a book', since it was mentioned a lot in reports of the period. I told her I thought it was odd, since now (2011)
*Lord of Chaos*
is by and far one of the fan favorites. It's interesting, because the older fans generally tend to favor books 1-3, and Erica herself was most impressed by
*The Dragon Reborn*
. One has to wonder if RJ didn't slow down to show them what 'half a book' was really like (aside from being worn out after completing his
[six-book contract](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=9#19)
with book-a-year deadlines).

## [Entry #20](./t-24/20)

#### Question

What is the world called?

#### Robert Jordan

Earth.

#### QUESTION

What about Randland?

#### Robert Jordan

Chuckle.

#### Footnote

The fandom calls it 'Randland', but this is not very helpful since it is used to refer to both the planet itself and the continent bordered by the Aryth Ocean, Blight, Dragonwall, and Sea of Storms.

## [Entry #21](./t-24/21)

#### Question

Why did Mat's battle happen off screen?

#### Robert Jordan

That's the way battles really happen. You don't actually see anything happen from the point of view, it's all a matter of waiting and trying not to die.

## [Entry #22](./t-24/22)

#### Question

What's the title of the next book?

#### Robert Jordan

Haven't decided.

## [Entry #23](./t-24/23)

#### Question

Is the "binding like criminals" meant to be using the Oath Rod?

#### Robert Jordan

No comment.

## [Entry #24](./t-24/24)

#### Erica Sadun

Unasked but may be answerable by his rules:

1. When Morgase thought "two beautiful children", was she thinking of Gawyn and Elayne or Gawyn and Galad?
  
2. Was the Verin "Moiraine sent me"/"I did not send her" incident a mistake or plot device?
  
3. Why did Ishamael split in two at the end of
*The Dragon Reborn*
?
  
4. Who was Kari al'Thor? And what did it mean to be second captain in Illian?
  
5. Is Egwene the reincarnation of Eldrene of Manetheren? And is Eldrene's veil significant?
  
6. Is Lews Therin Beidomon?
  
7. Is there organized religion in Randland?
  
8. What did your readers guess that you thought they'd never pick up on because you thought it was too subtle?
