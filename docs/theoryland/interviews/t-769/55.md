# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#55)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Those of you who've read the book before should recognize the case study Raoden mentions in this chapter. The woman who was miss-healed by the Elantrian is none other than Dilaf's wife—he speaks of her near the end of the book. This event—the madness and death of the woman he loved—is what drives his hatred of Elantris, and therefore Arelon and Teod.
