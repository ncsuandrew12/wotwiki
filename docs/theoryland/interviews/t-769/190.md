# [Interview #769, Entry #190]: Elantris Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#190)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### RAODEN VIEWPOINTS

It was essential to this chapter that I establish that Raoden can catch glimpses of what's happening around him. I went to a lot of work to get him into place above the city where he could make the connection, looking down on Elantris and the outer cities. The pool, actually, simply grew out of my need to find a way to put Raoden on the slopes of the mountains near the ending of the book. I like how it turned out in the final storyâ€”it added a dimension of mysticism to the Elantrian belief system, and it worked very well into the plotting I had developed. My only worry about it is that it was too far away from the Elantris, but we'll talk about that later.
