# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #132](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#132)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 48)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/62/Elantris-Chapter-48)

Now we're getting into the most heavily-edited chapters of the book. From here, if you're curious about the Mad Prince version of the book, look in the
['Deleted scenes'](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/46/Elantris-Deleted-Scenes-The-Mad-Prince)
section. For the rest of the annotations, just realize that what the Mad Prince once did, Telrii now does. There is, of course, a lot of cut material—however, all of the essential elements of the plot still occur.

Basically, the Mad Prince gave aggravation and problems to Hrathen in these late chapters. He'd had so much success with his Elantris-poison plots that I knew I had to give him a few more wrinkles during these chapters. In the original draft, he instigated the arrival of the Mad Prince, then realized that he couldn't control what he'd unleashed.

These were all difficult edits. I still think the Mad Prince worked better in the role than Telrii does—however, the book as a whole works better without the Mad Prince in it. Sometimes you have to cut something good in order to achieve a better over-all effect.
