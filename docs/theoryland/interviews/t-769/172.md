# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #172](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#172)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 58-2)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/77/Elantris-Chapter-58-2)

I don't know if you remember or not, but there was some small confusion on Raoden's part earlier about who Sarene was getting to bring supply shipments into Elantris. They always came and left at night, and didn't want anybody there to greet them. I realize we haven't seen the beggars very often, but I thought I'd use them again in this section. It made sense that they would be the ones Sarene used, assuming she knew about them. I'd say that Ashe found them in one of his information-gathering excursions.

#### Footnote

The leader of the beggars whom Sarene meets is Hoid.
