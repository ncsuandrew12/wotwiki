# [Interview #769, Entry #216]: Elantris Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#216)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Wrap-up)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/99/Elantris-Book-Wrap-Up)

So, that's my book. It may be about seven years old to me now (it was written in '99), but I still retain a great fondness for it. You have no idea how exciting it is to finally see it in print.

Hopefully, you enjoyed these annotations. I want to do them for all of my novels, but we'll see how things go. (Note from future Brandon, who is posting this after he wrote it some months earlier. There WILL be MISTBORN Annotations starting July, 2006!)

For now, I've got about 40,000 words here—a good half of a novel for free. Keep coming back to the website for more information, and make certain you check out the other bonus materials. (Deleted scenes will be posted throughout June.)

Oh, and make sure you go by MISTBORN when it comes out! If ELANTRIS was this good and I did it seven years ago, think of what kinds of things I'm working on right now!

I did most of these annotations while doing the copy edit of ELANTRIS—which is probably the last good read I'll give the book in the drafting process. Ten drafts. And now I turn away from the book and call it complete. Thank you so much for reading.

The ELANTRIS project
  
Begun 9-27-1999 (First Word to Page)
  
Finished 10-18-2004 (Final Annotation Written)
