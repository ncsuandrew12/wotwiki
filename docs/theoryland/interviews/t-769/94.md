#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 36)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/49/Elantris-Chapter-36)

Dakhor. One of the better words I came up for this book, I think.

Be patient with me—I'm going somewhere with this whole Dakhor monastery thing. We'll get there eventually. For now, enjoy Hrathen's visions. Or, rather, be disturbed by them. (Dakhor, if you haven't noticed, isn't a very friendly place. . . .)
