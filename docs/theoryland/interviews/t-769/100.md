# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #100](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#100)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This chapter is supposed to be something of a small redemption for Iadon. First off, we have his proclamation, which gives validity to his structure of rule. I think everything in the Arelish government makes a lot more sense now that we understand why Iadon did what he did.

The second bit of redemption comes at the burial site, where Sarene watches the barrow being built. Her thoughts don't excuse what Iadon did, but I hope they give something of an explanation. I like this scene because of the way it feelsâ€”there is a reverence about it which gives the proper atmosphere for a funeral.
