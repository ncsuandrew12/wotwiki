#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 28)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/41/Elantris-Chapter-28)

I've actually been called a 'square peg' before. I believe the line was "You're one of those creative types—you're a square peg, trying to fit into a round hole." I was twenty-two, and was getting let go from one of my first jobs.
That's another story, though. Just note—apperantly, fantasy writers and 'creative types' don't make good librarians. Go figure.
