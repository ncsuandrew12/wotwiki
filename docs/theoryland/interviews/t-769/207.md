# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #207](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#207)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### DAMSEL IN DISTRESS

Now, I'd just like to note here that Raoden's just returning a favor. Sarene is the one who gave him the clue that led to his fixing the Aons, then finally restoring Elantris. Now that she's in danger, he gets to rescue her in turn. Just because someone finds themselves in danger or trouble does not mean that they themselves aren't competent.
