# [Interview #769, Entry #147]: Elantris Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#147)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 53 part 1)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/68/Elantris-Chapter-53-1)

I hereby dub this chapter the official start of the Brandon Avalanche! Let the rejoicing begin.

On a more serious note, I'll get to some of the major events in the chapter in a moment. First, let's talk over some smaller annotations. I like the fact that Lukel doesn't like Kaloo—it seems like a perfect characterization for both of them. I will note, however, that Lukel has much better lines in this chapter than Kaloo does. His crack about Ahan getting sick by sheer laws of probability makes me chuckle every time I read them. Kaloo, on the other hand, spends all of his time trying to be honorable and true. Raoden is a good hero, but he can be dreadfully boring sometimes. Maybe that's why he threw himself into the Kaloo persona so eagerly.
