# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#24)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dilaf's outburst in this chapter is my first real hint that things are not going to go well between him and Hrathen. In a way, this chapter is a paradigm for events to come—Hrathen sets up what he think is a perfect, careful presentation. Then Dilaf arrives and throws chaos into it. Yet, despite that chaos, Dilaf has a profound—and arguably successful—effect on those around him.
