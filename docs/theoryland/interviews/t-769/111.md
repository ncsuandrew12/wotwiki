# [Interview #769, Entry #111]: Elantris Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#111)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 42)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/55/Elantris-Chapter-42)

Hum. I forgot how short many of these chapters got. Usually, I don't let my chapters get this short in a book. I like longer chapters, and tend to be pretty stable in my chapter lengths. ELANTRIS, however, is an aberration. It has a good twenty chapters more than my average book, despite being shorter than many of them.
