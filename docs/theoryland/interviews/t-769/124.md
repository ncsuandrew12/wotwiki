# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #124](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#124)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hrathen's deal with Eventeo here is the final piece of his most brilliant plan in the book. He milked those two vials of poison for a whole lot. He managed to regain his own faith, defeat Dilaf, turn himself into a hero, and get Eventeo's promise all with a few clever political twists. After he's pulled off a few tricks like this, three months suddenly doesn't seem like an unrealistic amount of time to convert a nation. (Or, at least, convert its nobilityâ€”which, as Hrathen has pointed out, is the same thing.)
