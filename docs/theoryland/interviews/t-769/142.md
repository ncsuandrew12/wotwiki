# [Interview #769, Entry #142]: Elantris Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#142)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Originally, this scene happened outside, at the Mad Prince's pyre. I liked the death imagery there a little betterâ€”Dilaf sifting through the ashes of a funeral pyre made for a very interesting image. However, the visuals in this newer version have their own advantages. I was able to use the lantern to half-light Dilaf's, and the smells from the tent make a nice sensual addition to the section.
