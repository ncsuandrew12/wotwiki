#### Brandon Sanderson

As for the first section break, I just really like ending with having Hrathen poison himself. This makes our first section incredibly longâ€”it takes up well over half of the book. I thought that was all right, however, since I figured increasingly short sections would enhance the pacing near the end of the book, speeding things up (hopefully.)
