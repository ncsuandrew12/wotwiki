# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #136](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#136)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 49 Part 2)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/64/Elantris-Chapter-49-2)

So, in this chapter we get to have a nice look at the 'mathematical' style to AonDor. To be honest, I'm not really a math person. I did well in my classes, but I never pursued the skill long enough to get deeply into theoretics. That's why there aren't any specifics in these chapters—I try to give enough to imply that AonDor works like mathematical proofs, but I don't include any specific ratios or equations.

My goal was to get across the 'Feel' of the magic without actually having to get into number crunching—which is something at which Raoden's much better than I am. (Though, it's less numbers and more of an understudying of length, location, and combination.)
