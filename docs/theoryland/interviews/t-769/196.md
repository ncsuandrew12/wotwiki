# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #196](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#196)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 61-2)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/87/Elantris-Chapter-61-2)

#### SHUDEN'S CHAYSHAN

The several mentions of the ChayShan, along with both of the scenes where Shuden performs it, were added to the book to give a feeling of scope. I wanted the reader to understand that there are things in this world that are different from the increasingly-familiar magic and society of Arelon.

We'll talk a little bit more about this event in the text. However, realize that the ChayShan wasn't ever intended to be effective or successful—it's not a Deus Ex Machina for the people trapped inside Elantris. It is a hint of things I plan to do with the future of this world.
