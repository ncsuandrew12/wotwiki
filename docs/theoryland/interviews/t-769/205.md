# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #205](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#205)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### LUKEL

And, here we have Lukel joking again. Just like a the end of last chapter, where he faints. Comic relief shouldn't be underestimated, I think. Especially comic relief like thisâ€”jests and levity given in-character by people who are trying to lighten the mood of a stressful time. Lukel isn't there simply to entertain the reader, he's there to show a different side of human reaction. I think that if I were in his situation, I'd be trying to find a way to laugh about what happened too.
