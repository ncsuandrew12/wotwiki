#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 34)](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/47/Elantris-Chapter-34)

I know it seems like I'm setting Shaor up for a return, but I really don't intend to bring her back. At least, I didn't when I wrote this chapter. The truth is, I just didn't want to write a scene of the madmen returning with the torn up body of a little girl.

However, every time I read this section, I can't help noticing that I left one of the book's most dangerous villains alive (potentially.) Ironically, because it seems so obvious from the text that Shaor is still alive, I think I'd avoid doing anything with her in a sequel. It seems like in fiction, any time you don't see a body, you automatically assume (often correctly) that the villain is still out there somewhere.

However, in this case, it really doesn't make sense to use her again. Shaor wasn't a threat because of any special skills on her part—I see no reason to bring her back.
