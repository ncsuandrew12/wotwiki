# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #128](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#128)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This ending scene is where Hrathen and Raoden come the closest to speaking to one another. Hrathen stands there, looking down on Raoden. Then he leaves. In case you were wondering, no. They never say a word to one another throughout the entire book. Sarene mixes with both of them, but Hrathen and Raoden barely interact.
