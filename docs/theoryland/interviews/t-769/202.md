# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #202](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#202)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### THE SALVATION OF ELANTRIS

Yes, Raoden lets the Dakhor monks go. That's the sort of thing that happens in this book. If you want something more gritty, you can read MISTBORN. (Which is gritty for me, though nowhere near the genius sadism of George R. R. Martin's books.)

I like having this scene from Lukel's viewpoint. If nothing else were gained from his other sections, I think the scene of the Elantrians emerging from the flames would be enough to justify his viewpoints in these last few chapters.

So, anyway, that's one major plot line finished. Elantris has been restored. Most fantasies, however, are about characters more they are about plot. I love great twists and revelationsâ€”but the book isn't over until the characters are fulfilled. So, onward.
