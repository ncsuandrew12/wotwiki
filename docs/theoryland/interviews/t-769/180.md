# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #180](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#180)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, and yes, Elantrians can go unconscious. They can fall asleep, after all. The Elantrian brain is the one organ that continues to work very similarly to the way it did before the Shaod. So, taking a large amount of trauma can make it black out. The Elantrian won't remain unconscious foreverâ€”but when he wakes up, the actual physical damage will be there. That's why Raoden loses his sense of balance and everything gets fuzzy.
