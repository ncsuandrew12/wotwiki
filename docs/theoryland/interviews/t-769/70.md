# [Interview #769, Entry #70]: Elantris Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#70)

#### Brandon Sanderson

And, as a note on the final exchange, did you forget about the cliffhanger at the end of Raoden's chapter? My hope was that knowing, from Raoden, that the gates to Elantris opened sometime after the attack, the reader would assume that Sarene actually failed to stop the soldiers. Now that she has, however, stopped them, you are reminded that SOMEONE is entering the city. One guess who it is.
