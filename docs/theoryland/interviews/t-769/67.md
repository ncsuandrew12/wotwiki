# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #67](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#67)

#### Brandon Sanderson

We have a nice little cliff-hanger at the end of this section. However, you have to remember the format of the triad systemâ€”when we go back to Sarene, we'll be jumping back in time a bit. That means that you won't immediately discover what is going on with the gate of Elantris.
Dramatically, this is my favorite of the triad structures. We get to hold this cliffhanger for a long time, building it through the next chapter.
