# [Interview #769: Elantris Annotations, Entry #91](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=769#91)

#### Brandon Sanderson

About here, I decided to start having Ahan be less helpful in these meetings. The subtext here is that he's been playing both sides, intending—yet never quite managing—to overthrow the Sarene's group. Early in the book, he was having fun just playing the game—and he never did anything incriminating against the king. Now, with Iadon gone, he's reworking his motivations. So, that's why he's a bit less communicative in this chapter.
