# [Interview #144: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=144#4)

#### Aan'allein

After that little episode Jordan asked:

#### Robert Jordan

Okay, so who would like to ask me any questions?

#### Aan'allein

People were still hesitant, so I was once again the first to raise my hand.

#### Robert Jordan

\*smiling\* Ah Sander... Of course Sander has a question.

#### Aan'allein

You talked before about the same Age in different Turnings, you can compare them to tapestries, they look alike at first sight. I was wondering, when at first sight, what would make a difference... Two points I'm really interested in. [\*grumble\* A stupid mobile phone was apparently not switched off here; yet again... I think Leiden was the only question session not interrupted by this.] Level of technology and gender related...if for example the roles of men and women were switched between Ages, would the tapestries still look alike at first sight?

#### Robert Jordan

Ah, but you're not gonna have that sort of switch. In this Age, how can you have a switch? One of the things for instance in the Age that I wrote. One of the things...For instance, I've been accused by some people of ignoring the feminist struggle. Well, there is no feminist struggle in this world, because there is no need for one. No one says a woman can't do this because she is a woman. A woman wants to be a blacksmith, she can learn to be a blacksmith, and she becomes a blacksmith, or a merchant or a wagon driver, or a worker on the docks, or wherever else. All of that took place, took place a long time ago. And they're very good at it. That sets the whole reasons why this should come about. Three thousand years ago the world was destroyed, by men. There is one group that has survived for that three thousand years, one organization that has managed to stick together for three thousand years, and have a great influence on history, and that is a group of women.

Okay, so you just don't have, you just don't have it. To have a reversal of roles means... absolutely nothing.

#### Aan'allein

Okay, so the sociological results would always be the same, every Turning...?

#### Robert Jordan

Ah, that is one of the things, one of the things that would be a large, a very large change. Uhm, it's gonna be the smaller details, smaller things than that which change.
