# [Interview #144: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=144#19)

#### Aan'allein

I don't remember too clearly what caused this, but suddenly he was talking about faking his own death and starting a new life. Either as a rock star, or in the circus. Harriet was rooting for the rock star idea. Yes, just faking his own death, putting a coffin full with rocks into the ground, and going to go off and start another career somewhere. Hmm, and I managed to tape one line of Jordan suddenly starting singing: "Take me in pretty woman, ride the snake."
