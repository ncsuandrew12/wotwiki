That afternoon there was a signing session by Robert Jordan.

It was horrible cold, so I and Liandra, Wolf Gaidin and the rest sneaked into the signing room to warm up (that was one of the only places were it was warm).

Someone from the publisher also came in later, but she didn't send us away, because I told her RJ knows us. I didn't mention that we had no permission however to be there. :)

But RJ didn't seemed to mind. He signed a lot of books for us. :-)
