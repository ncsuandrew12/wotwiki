# [Interview #144: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=144#13)

#### Aan'allein

Then there was a 15 minute break, and afterwards W.F. Maryson, one of those Dutch writers, would interview Jordan a bit before more audience questions were allowed.

He started pretty badly by saying that he would ask only bad questions, because he'd been told that if he asked a good one Jordan would talk for half an hour, while that much time wasn't allowed him. So Jordan monosylabically answered the first few questions, and the poor guy Maryson began feeling very uncomfortable. (Luckily for him someone else had already asked the "how many more books," because in the discussion between Dutch writers that went before I'd learned that was to be one of his questions, and he didn't seem to heed my warning about it.) After a few questions things went better though.
