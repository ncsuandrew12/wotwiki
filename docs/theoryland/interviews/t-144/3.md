# [Interview #144: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=144#3)

#### Aan'allein

Nobody was really going first, so he looked at the front row, and said:

#### Robert Jordan

Isabel? [laughter from those who'd been to signings before] Actually Isabel, why don't you just bring me your passport right now so I can see it.

#### Aan'allein

Apparently Jordan didn't really believe her about her age either. If you remember back to my first signing report about when he was in Leiden, you might remember me saying that she probably was a lot younger than she looked like. Well, she really is 17 (which is why Jordan told the entire audience her passport said she is 13), and she looks like she is 17, but she behaves as if she's pretending to be a lot older than she really is (ouch... forgive me, Isabel, if you ever read this).
