#### Question

A question about other things Jordan would want to write.

#### Robert Jordan

I have a list of the books I might want to write. I continuously add things to it. I used to keep it on paper, in a notebook...and the notebook became full. That was just basic, basic plotlines of...thoughts of what I'd like to write here or there or the other thing. And I realized twenty years ago that the list of books I wanted to write, the stories I wanted to write was impossible. I would not live long enough. I would not live long enough if I lived three or four lifetimes. I would have to live at least five or six lifetimes to complete the list as it then stood. So, you make choices.
