#### Question

Don't remember anything about the wording, but it should be clear from the answer...

#### Robert Jordan

There's a strict border between my writing and the rest of my life certainly, but the story involves itself in my head. And I continually think about it. I'm always thinking about how I'm going to structure things, how I want the flow of words to work, the rhythms and patterns of words. The difficulty is, I must...I have two rituals at night that are necessary. If I fail... The first is that I read...someone else. And I must read for several hours. And then having read for several hours, work myself from the books, I must make sure that there...for half an hour or so, I won't drift back with my thinking to my own books. So I drink a very, very large brandy...yes, 6 or 8 ounces. And just straight down. And this makes me sleepy enough that I will drift off, and that's the night.
