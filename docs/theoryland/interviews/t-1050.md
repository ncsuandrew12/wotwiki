## Entry #1

#### macros

The signing was awesome. Brandon is a really cool dude. As for my questions, I asked:

#### Footnote

[Paraphrases replaced with transcription.]

## Entry #2

#### macros

Based on what we know currently about the ten heartbeats, why does Szeth require ten heartbeats to bring forth his Honorblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Perception is a very important part of how these things all work, and remember, the Honorblades work differently from everything else. Everything was based upon them. Why don’t you read and find out what’s going on there, but remember, the characters’ perception is very important.

#### macros

So then that’s why at one point Shallan requires ten heartbeats and now she doesn’t.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, just like—it’s the exact same reason why Kaladin’s forehead wounds don’t heal, because he views himself as need—as having those, somewhere deep inside of him, and that can’t heal until that goes away. And it’s the same reason why in
*Warbreaker*
, when you bring something to life your intention, rather than really what you say, is what matters. It’s all about perception.

## Entry #3

#### macros

I finally asked if he could write anything in my book that we did not already know about the Skybreakers. I will upload the picture when I get home but it is the second oath of the Skybreakers which says:

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I will put the law before all else."

## Entry #4

#### macros

Hope everyone else had a great time. Unfortunately I showed up too late to meet anyone.
