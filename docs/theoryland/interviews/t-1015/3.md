Reread Wheel of Time 1-10 or find summaries somewhere and start on 11?

I'm really torn on this one. It's been nearly 7 years since I've read any of the books and 10+ for some of the early ones.

I'm leaning toward a reread but, damn, i know it's going to take me nearly 10 months to get through them all. Probably about the time Sanderson has the last one done.

Are there even any good thorough summaries out there for each book?

Edit\Update: So I decided to start rereading them and am nearly done with the first book. I'm really glad I'm not doing the summaries, it's almost like reading them the first time since it's been so long. There's so much I had forgotten and I'm really enjoying the read.

I just purchased the last few books, and am restarting the series from the beginning. As you say, I'm pretty good up until
*Lord of Chaos*
. After that... will be a bit of grind. The one where nothing happens in the entire book (brings all characters up to 'a great disturbance in the Force') shits me.

I think I will stick in there, but it will take some time.

I've always liked
[Encylopaedia WoT](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/)
's summaries, they break down each chapter for each book with plenty of embedded references.

Encyclopaedia WoT is basically my go-to quick reference in working on the books. I went so far as to get a copy from the creators to upload locally on my machine so I'll have it for internet outages. It's great for quick reminders, or for locating the right scene I need to re-read in the books in order to get a viewpoint or scene right.

Don't know that I can weigh in on this more than that. What has been said here is excellent. The summaries sgtpsycho posted are great. TarValon's wiki is a good resource too. But whether to reread or not...depends on personal preference. I will say that the books that people tend to feel drag felt a lot less draggy to me during my last reread, as I knew the ending.

Having an ending in hand changes things, at least for me. Instead of raging about a book because it makes such little progress, and one has waited for it for years, one can read the slower book and appreciate the side stories being told, as you know the ending is right there waiting. I suspect more people will have this response once the last one is done.
