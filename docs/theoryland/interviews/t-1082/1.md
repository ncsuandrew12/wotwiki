# [Interview #1082: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Khyrindor, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1082#1)

#### Khyrindor

Shards can talk to dead people. Are the Tranquiline Halls where everyone in the cosmere goes when they die? Or does each world have its own heaven.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

There is an afterlife that is not heaven that the Shards don't know about, or can't look into. Each world has its own heaven depending on its religions. The real afterlife is different across the cosmere, and the Tranquiline Halls are different.
