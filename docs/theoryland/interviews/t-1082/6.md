# [Interview #1082, Entry #6]: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Khyrindor](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1082#6)

#### Khyrindor

Was Allomancer Jak in the newspapers in
*The Alloy of Law*
just Hoid in disguise?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

No. I actually just published a short story with him in it.

(He also said that he came up with the idea for him in an RPG writing group, or something along those lines.)

#### Footnote

The short story in question is in the Alloy of Law supplement of the Mistborn Adventure Game.
