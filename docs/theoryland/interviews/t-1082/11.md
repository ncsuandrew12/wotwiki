# [Interview #1082, Entry #11]: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Khyrindor](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1082#11)

Hoid went through Cultivation's Shardpool to get to Roshar as opposed to Honor's. Yet, he notes he never got along well with Cultivation. Why did he choose her Shardpool rather than Honor's?
