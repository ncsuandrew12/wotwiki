# [Interview #1082: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Khyrindor, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1082#11)

#### Khyrindor

Hoid went through Cultivation's Shardpool to get to Roshar as opposed to Honor's. Yet, he notes he never got along well with Cultivation. Why did he choose her Shardpool rather than Honor's?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

You're making assumptions!

(I asked if it's possible that it was Honor's and he said it's possible.)
