## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#1)

#### Question

I just wanted to say thank you. I'm in the last two months of my Emergency Medicine residency, so it was eight years of medical training, and you're the only fiction author I've read.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow. I feel impressed.

#### Question

I don't have time for fiction really.

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I was in grad school I didn't get much reading done either. I wasn't in your style of grad school, I was in easy grad school, but I still understand.

#### Question

Yeah, every time you release something, I make time for it. I'm very appreciative of being able to participate in your world.

#### Question

Thank you for writing Secret History. That was a definite love letter to Cosmere fans.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was the point of it, yes.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#3)

#### Question

Are the Shardblade practice guards... Are they made of aluminum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

U-huh! \*laughs\* Good question! RAFO! But you have an excellent question, you're the first to ask that, and I think you're a very smart person.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#4)

#### Question

When you're writing, do you hear Michael Kramer in your head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do now. I asked for him by name because I liked how he and Kate Reading did the Wheel of Time books. Yeah, I get a big kick out of doing Wayne's voices and trying to figure out how Michael's going to try to read those.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#5)

#### Question

What were your inspiration when you wrote the [Mistborn] series, or for particular characters...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, Mistborn-- I passed, honestly, through a fog bank at 70 mph driving from my mom's house, and I'm like, "This looks cool, I've got to use this." That's the first thought I can think of. Feruchemy goes back to being in high school and being an insomniac, being really tired and wishing I could store up my sleep, so I'd be sleepy when I wanted to be sleepy. Kelsier's inspiration was a guy who had been only out for himself, who realized the greater import of doing something.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#6)

#### Question

What is your favorite Harry Potter book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My favorite Harry Potter book is the Patronus one. Is that three? Yeah, that's three, isn't it.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#7)

#### Question

Can you share any abilities that Hoid has accrued so far in the books, has he-- I can't even pronounce the L-word...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, lerasium, he is indeed an Allomancer. That has happened. I haven't confirmed much else, but he does have that.

#### Footnote

confirmed

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#8)

#### Question

How involved are you in that [audiobook] process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, I pick the reader, and then I read all the names in the book and send them an audio file of that, and they listen to it and they sometimes follow what I say.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#9)

#### Question

You've said that Shardblades can be made in other magic systems. So if it's not like a Shardblade from Roshar, what makes it a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The “shard” refers to the heavy investiture of a Shard of Adonalsium. Most of what you’ll see will be the Roshar ones, but it is technically possible to make them out of the other magic systems. It's going to be a heavily invested magical weapon is kind of how I would define it.

#### Question

So are the Bands one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ummm... I would not call them one, but they are close, they're not Invested enough.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#10)

#### Question

I think the UK covers are really cool.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the UK has this thing - the US likes to have different cover artists for different series, the UK likes to have a single cover artist for an author. So there's kind of a different style and philosophy.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#11)

#### Question

Is there any plan to revisit [Legion]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I plan to do one more.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#12)

#### Question

In Words of Radiance, there is a character named Iyatil... Is she a member of the race that we see in Bands of Mourning in the--

#### Brandon Sanderson

She is related to them in the same way that I am Danish.

How many words do you think you average a day?

I average about 2,000.

#### Question

[Laughing] That's actually a goal I could hit!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, not too many - I'm just incredibly consistent.

#### Question

What is your favorite Beatle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ringo Starr, because he lucked out. [...] I have never had anybody ask me my favorite Beatle, particularly not someone who looked like he was seven.

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#15)

#### Question

I want you to know that our third graders think that our librarian is evil now.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh good, good, good. I'm very pleased to be corrupting your third graders.

#### Question

And they're very suspicious of anyone in horn-rimmed glasses.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmm. I need to get myself some, because it would be like, cognitive dissonance to the kids. [...] You tell them they're not allowed to have as bad handwriting as me. MY third-grade teacher thinks it's atrocious that I never learned how to have good handwriting. She'll never forgive me.

#### Question

That one right there [pointing to a book?] - he named his son Kelsier.

Wow.

#### Question

He was having a really tough time when he first came out, so he named him after the Survivor.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, give him the best. That means a lot to me.

#### Question

What is your favorite female A name, and it cannot be [?].

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, uhhh...Anastasia? I think it's a very pretty name. Arwen is good too. Very nerdy, so...

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#18)

#### Question

On the scale of not-very to extremely... how confused should I still be about Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Pretty confused, it’s not-- I mean, I haven’t even dug into really what it is.

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#19)

#### Question

You mentioned that the flakes of metal are catalysts to access the powers of Preservation. What do the birds from Patji use as catalysts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You don't always have to have the exact same thing for catalysts, for that it’s kind of more of an innate connection, in the same way that the metals have an innate connection. They ARE the catalyst if that makes sense.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#20)

#### Question

If Hoid was on Scadrial during the original Mistborn trilogy, and had a bead of lerasium, and took it and gained Allomantic powers, could he go to Roshar during Stormlight and still have those Allomantic powers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes… Most of the magics are not re-- area centric, though a few are.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#21)

#### Question

Lady taking photos: Best baby photo ever, huh?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m just glad you didn’t ask me to sign the baby, since that’s happened to me before. I feel very weird signing babies.

#### Question

You're definitely our favorite author. You're the first author [we recommended to each other?].

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, that's great. The first one I recommended to my wife was Robert Jordan.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#22)

#### Question

Because I'm an accountant, I'm curious - ebook vs. regular book: which do you make more off of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, when a hardcover is out, I make more off a hardcover. When the paperback is out, I make more off an ebook.

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#23)

#### Question

As you were constructing the Allomantic powers revealed in the Wax and Wayne books, I was just curious why you chose cadmium and chromium to be metals.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well I picked them way back when I designed the magic system, and I wanted metals that would be easily recognizable but which wouldn't be commonly available in a medieval society, so that as society progressed it would make sense, they would have access to these new metals, if that makes sense. Aluminum was a little in that as well, but I like aluminum because they had it anciently, but very rarely. So it could be a more mythical metal.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#24)

#### Question

The magic system you wrote in the Wheel of Time, that seems like a non-constrained system, and then most of your worlds have a constrained system of magic. Which one was harder to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Time was harder to write, because just my natural inclination is the other way.

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#25)

#### Question

Which of your books do you think would be the best to adapt into a musical?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A musical? Uhh...I have not given that a whole lot of thought...um...Alcatraz, because it's silly, it's kind of a silly idea.

#### Question

Okay. I thought I might ask you one you haven't heard before.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You win a prize. That's one I haven't heard before.

#### Question

I heard somewhere that you were trying to find time to play Bloodborne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did play Bloodborne. I liked it.

#### Question

It was hard for me, man. [... just with the patch?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Get the axe, the big axe, take it to its big thing, learn to use the [charge?] attack, spin around and hit things before they get to you. And then you'll be fine.

Right on. I'll get back to it.

How’s that Lift novella?

It has not been written yet but I’ve got good plans for it.

## [Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#28)

#### Question

I really admire how [prolifically?] you write, just like things that I'd be terrified to write, so I haven't [?]...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Did you hear my speech?

#### Question

I did! But whenever I write something it sounds really hollow...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's okay, it happens to all of us. Everyone kind of starts that way. It doesn't have to be good until you've done revisions. Give yourself the permission to do a crappy first draft.

#### Question

The writing defies me if it's really crappy...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah, but everybody fixes it, don't stress. You've got to learn how to do the crappy first draft. You've gotta trust me on this one!

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#29)

#### Question

A lot of your books deal with dealing with mortality. Do you have a contingency author lined up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't have one lined up, I just have good notes. And my assistant knows what authors I like and things like that, it would really just depend on how long I last. Like right now I'd probably ask Brian McClellan to do it, but who knows, he might be too big by...but hopefully I'd last until I'm like 90 and we just need someone to finish like one book.

## [Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#30)

#### Question

Oo, I'm signing a Magic box. Is this...

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a peasant cube.

#### Brandon Sanderson

A peasant cube! So it includes uncommons, right? Pauper is common only, right?

#### Question

Yeah, yeah, it's not enough diversity with just commons.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I made a common-only cube and it just felt like 4/4's hitting each other in the face.

#### Question

It's aggro, that's the thing. But with this you can get combo, you can get control, red range...

#### Brandon Sanderson

What's the combo? Is there like a storm deck in peasant?

#### Question

You can play [?] storm deck in peasant, all the pieces are common and uncommon, but what I most like is to draft [crystal shards?] and [? drifters]...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, that's a combo after my own heart.

#### Question

And then I had a [Sphinx's Tutelage] in place, so I mill my opponents out, and they're like, Are you seriously going to do this? And I'm like, I seriously am.

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughing] Oh, that's brilliant. That's brilliant. No, you can't [scoop?], no.

#### Question

Do we get to find out eventually where Calamity comes from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Eventually, like the next trilogy I do will dig into that... You've got to remember, in the teen books I’m not going to dig into lore as much, they're written as action novels. So in the next series I'll get you some of your answers, but that's not what the point of these books-- like The Stormlight Archive, the point is the lore. In these books, the point is “have fun”. So you will, but it's going to take a little bit longer.

## [Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#33)

#### Question

What were some of first [Epic] powers you thought about but didn't do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A lot of the early powers I thought of were ones that big superheroes already have and use too much, like electricity or some of these things. So I'm like, I want powers that I can do something new with, not something that I'll just repeat what Marvel and DC have done.

## [Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#34)

#### Question

Are you friends with James Dashner?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Dashner and I go way, way back. I read Maze Runner before it was published, which was pretty cool, and then I gave him this cool quote about how good it is and he didn't even put it on the book when it was published. I was like, "Aw, come on, James!" But yeah, I met him in a middle school, when we were both brand-new writers. He was going in to talk to students, and I went in right after him.

## [Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#35)

#### Question

How long did it take you to come up with the bad metaphors in the Reckoners?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was really hard. I thought it'd be easy, cause writing bad stuff you usually do on accident, and then it took me forever to come up with them. It was the hardest part of the books.

#### Question

Yeah, it wasn't that they were bad, they were just a different way of thinking...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's right.

What was your inspiration for Wit, or who?

Hmm. The closest thing I've been able to say is the court jester from King Lear, he's one of my favorite literary characters. But I'm not sure if I can point to anyone specific other than that.

## [Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#38)

#### Question

WOT pronunciation.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Finding out [how Robert Jordan pronounced things] is kind of hard sometimes, because his wife and his assistant disagree.

## [Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#39)

#### Question

Do you wish you had [?] any of your stories based on fan feedback?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, with the exception of a few things in the Wheel of Time, where there a few things I don't think I got quite right. With my books, I'm pretty confident...I mean, that doesn't mean everyone will love everything about them, but I'm confident that I told the story I wanted to tell, and sometimes that's not the story everybody wants, but it is the story I felt was the right story.

## [Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#40)

#### Question

You think you'll ever make a full novel of Legion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I could ever get the TV show off the ground, I would, but it depends on whether I can get someone to make a TV show of it.

## [Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#41)

Have you ever considered writing nonfiction?

#### Question

Jasnah’s book, would an in world person consider that she is also advocating for gender equality for men?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In-world? Jasnah would, but I don’t think most people who read it would.

#### Question

Do they have a concept of alcoholism in Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Does Dalinar’s family have it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmmmm… That will be answered in the next book, but you should definitely be asking that question.

#### Question

Is there an abolitionist movement in Roshar? In any culture there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In ANY culture? Eh...yeees.

#### Question

Are we ever going to find out about all of Adolin’s failed relationships?

Probably a little bit more. Not a ton. But a little bit more.

#### Question

Do you have a background in biology or medicine, because you come up with so many creative worlds that seem like there's the...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I started as a biochemistry major. And then I jumped ship to English after the math kind of drove me out. Math is fun, but I didn't enjoy the busywork of math, I felt like I was jumping through too many hoops, once I got it I'm like, "I'm done." I mean, I got A's in Calculus, so I did do my math...but it's like, I didn't want to sit and solve equations for Avogadro's number every day all day. I felt like I was doing too much of that and not enough blowing stuff up, which is what I had learned chemistry really was when I was in high school.

## [Entry #46](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#46)

#### Question

I have never signed any shark socks before. I can try to sign the stick, but my signature's kind of...not stick like.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's better than an ice cube.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And it's better than a baby. Someone at a signing asked me to sign a baby once. And a sword - it actually worked really well. I've signed a sword, I've signed license plates, I've refused to sign inappropriate body parts.

## [Entry #47](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#47)

#### Question

Where'd you get the idea for burning metals getting different powers?

Metabolism. Researching metabolism. When I wrote it out, it works. It's weird, but it works.

#### Question

Wax and Wayne. Who did you base them on?

Wax is like a mix between Clint Eastwood and Sherlock Holmes in my head. Wayne - I'm not even sure. He just kinda came out of nowhere at me.

Mistcoat: Duster that’s been shredded into strips. But remember, there’s not like an industry that makes these. Each person commissions their own, and so they vary quite widely.

#### Question

Are they at the waist, or…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s a little above the waist.

#### Question

How do you get to sleep until noon with three children?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have a very, very patient, loving and wonderful wife. And in recompense, we make sure that the company has an assistant for her who comes in at 9 o'clock and helps get the kids off to school and then watches the 3-year-old for a few hours so she can do work. She has some sanity lent in that way. She was a schoolteacher for years, so she can get up, right? It's a schoolteacher thing.

Just my house. Basically - my kids are still little, so it's come home and let them climb on me. That's what we do. Play whatever video game they're into at the moment.

## [Entry #52](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#52)

#### Question

How do you make cultures so vibrant?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dig deep rather than go wide. One or two cultures that play off of each other in an interesting way, where you've considered a lot of the ramifications, are going to be better than trying to create 30 different cultures. Try to keep focused on what's going to be important to the characters and the books, and try to spend your worldbuilding there. So like if the characters are going to have conflict over religion, spend time on religion. But if instead they're going to have different linguistics and that's a source of conflict, spend time on the linguistics.

## [Entry #53](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#53)

#### Question

So in the Stormlight Archive, they have the two Surges, and they have a third power effect, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have kind of effects on each other, like a reverberation. Yes. I wouldn’t call it expressly a third power, I’d call it interactions.

#### Question

So, it seems like...you don’t have to confirm anything, but it seems like Kaladin is able to transfer his powers to his men following him…

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Windrunners are known for having lots of squires.

#### Question

#### Question

When Wax changes his weight, is that weight or mass?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is...he is changing...so he is actually changing his mass, in a weird...It's kind of halfway in between, is really what it is. But it follows the laws of conservation of momentum, so it's not just weight. It's timidly half-stepping in between.

## [Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#55)

#### Question

What is the thing with Adolin's serial dating? Is it just...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is bad with relationships, and that's just it. He's a little bit scared of being good at relationships, and so there's some kind of unconscious sabotaging going on. But yeah, he's young and he's bad at relationships.

#### Question

Do the Radiants have only one gender per [order], or you can have...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You have - yeah. There can be different genders.

#### Question

Why is Dalinar very restrictive of Adolin but not with Renarin and Elhokar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a little bit - I would say a slight flaw on Dalinar's part, he's too hard on Adolin. But that's because Adolin is in line for the throne, and he's the eldest son, and the heir, and all of that stuff. I would say that Dalinar's a little too lax in some ways, a little too strict in others.

There is a metal used to charge in the last Mistborn book, is that lithium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah, nnnnn... [Sounds like he's going to say "no" but then changes his mind] I'll dig into that, that's another RAFO. But I'm glad you're thinking along those lines. Let's just say that.

#### taveren

Did the original Shardbearers know what Shard they were grabbing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Another RAFO. Sorry. You're asking really good questions. Really good questions.

There are different kinds of spren that bond with people and it appears they’re based on a concept. Is it possible to have a concept which would make a Nahel bond that gives two Surges that don’t align to one of the Radiant orders?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, uh...this is a theoretical possibility that has not happened.

## [Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#60)

#### Question

Did something happen to Demoux between Mistborn and Stormlight to turn him into a jerk, or am I misinterpreting his actions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is not a jerk, but he is not...

#### Question

As pure as he is in Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. He's a little more idealistic than pure, how about that?

#### Question

Are we going to hear [his] story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. [...] I'm toying with some stuff in Secret History too [two?], it'll get into some of this.

#### Question

Is there going to be more Secret History?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have to go into the cracks between other books, but not...I am planning to do more right now, I'm not opposed to having more like that happen.

## [Entry #61](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#61)

#### Question

The Cognitive and the Physical Realms...do they [?] to the Shardworld for the character they're related to, or can you go back and forth - like in Secret History, when he passes off of Scadrial and to the outskirts, within I guess the Cognitive Realm, is that something they could do with other Shardworlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Footnote

the question seems incomplete

## [Entry #62](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#62)

#### Question

What is the raw power of the most powerful [relationship?]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that there isn't one.

#### Footnote

another incomplete question

## [Entry #63](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#63)

#### Question

I was curious if the world of Sixth of the Dusk was going to make another appearance...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will likely make another appearance, I am unlikely to do another story there just because I have too many things to do sequels too, but if you keep your eyes open, you can see...

#### Question

Is Hoid related?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will see some more.

#### Question

How long did you work on the signature?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's kind of interesting, since it started off being legible, kind of like that, that's "Brandon" and then a "Sanderson". And then it just over ten years turned into...This is the B and that's the rest of my name, and then that's the S.

#### Question

Speed, efficiency. Looks cool too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, my handwriting's so sloppy anyway that I figure a symbol is better than trying to write it out.

#### Question

It makes you look like a doctor, too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that's right.

#### Question

When Wax's uncle gets blown up and [?] says "you will serve us in another realm", is that a [truth?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wait wait, who says that?

#### Question

With Suit, the end of Bands of Mourning? He gets blown up...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh right, right...So, yeah, that is not specifically answered on purpose. That is meant to be more ambiguous, it may not even be a true statement.

#### Question

So their deity doesn't pick which souls -

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not saying yes or no, I'm just saying, don't take what they say as law, as the actual state of things. It may just be a belief on their part.

#### Question

The ten Surges on Roshar, I think you said are basically a different set of laws of physics.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Question

Are those laws of physics consistent throughout the Cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes, to an extent. You would consider, like - it's kind of weird because I based them on the idea of the fundamental forces, but this is kind of like a human construction. Like you could say that physics is pure and natural, but we're still putting things in boxes. And the scientists on Roshar would for instance consider being able to travel between the Cognitive and Physical Realms as a force, the thing that pulls people back and forth between that, as a fundamental force. I don't know if it would fit our definition of a fundamental force.

#### Question

Marvel or DC?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[big sigh] So Marvel makes better movies, generally, I classically am a fan of Batman and Superman, but I feel like Marvel's been knocking it out of the park and I did not like the Man of Steel movie. And so it's kind of like half and half. I'm going to say Marvel right now until DC redeems itself.

## [Entry #68](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#68)

#### Question

Thoughts on Force Awakens?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I liked The Force Awakens. I thought it was a good film. I was a little disappointed in another Death Star, but I understand that the idea is to introduce a new generation to the concept of Star Wars, and in that case it fulfilled its role. I thought the characters were really good, and that's the most important part.

#### Question

Who was your favorite?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm going to say the Storm Trooper dude, what's his name, Finn.

#### Question

I liked Poe, he was precious.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was, he was. But I really enjoyed Finn as a character.

## [Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#69)

#### Question

How do you decide that a magic system you're working on is done?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I feel like the stories I'm telling are working, I go with it. That doesn't mean I have every little thing worked out - I'm a planner, so I have a lot of them, if I don't have something worked out I like to sort of let people know in the book - here's a hole that the characters have noticed, if that makes sense. But at some point you just have to write. So it's a more by instinct thing.

#### Question

I've created a couple magic systems and done worldbuilding, but whenever I think it's done, I come up with another facet that I think would be interesting.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I say, if you want to tell stories, write the story and write down all the facets in a separate file. Then in a revision, go foreshadow that these things could exist, but don't deal with them until you get to a future book. If you look at Mistborn, there's hints about how Feruchemy works, but we don't really deal with it in Mistborn since there's so much already piled onto you.

#### Question

The guards that are used on the Shardblades, are those made of aluminum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[After commenting that 17th Shard must be talking about it] This is an excellent question that is well asked, and people are thinking along the right lines. I haven't answered 100%, but people are thinking the right way.

## [Entry #71](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#71)

#### Question

[on David's bad metaphors]

#### Brandon Sanderson

It came from me writing a bad metaphor on accident, and then being like, "I'm going to run with this and see where it goes." I like it [as a character quirk] for David because his personality is that he's a little overzealous about things, and so trying so hard on the metaphors is a great way to express that.

## [Entry #72](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#72)

#### Question

What era were you reading comics and what...

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first comic I got into was the original Eastman and Larry[?] TMNT, which I really really liked, and after that I read what people gave me, so like Sandman - I mean, I'm the kid of the 90's, right? The Gaiman stuff, and Watchmen of course, but that's my era, Kingdom Come. the good graphic novels that have a complete story were always my favorite, anytime I would get into something else, I would get into it and then they'd change writers or something like this and I'd get annoyed. Nowadays my favorite comic is actually a webcomic.

## [Entry #73](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#73)

#### Question

Are you doing any video game work these days? I know you did some work with Infinity Blade stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm actually going to LA to hear some pitches on video game stuff on Monday, so yes, but I haven't yet been able to get anything made. So we shall see if it ever happens. I've helped the Infinity Blade guys with their next game also, just as an advisory position thing. That's been fun. Their next game's going to be awesome.

## [Entry #74](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#74)

#### Question

If you were a Leecher, could you destroy a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Umm...I'm going to RAFO that for now, let's just say that it would be incredibly difficult if it were possible, and I'm not going to even say if it is. The Investiture in a Shardblade is much greater than your average Allomancer, but...This type of thing is not unheard of in the cosmere. The larkin, the Leechers, and Nightblood all have a similar sort of thing going on. Destroying a Shardblade would be REALLY hard. And Investiture resists other forms of Investiture, so.

## [Entry #75](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#75)

#### Question

We had a stray cat that we adopted a couple years ago, and we named it Lestibournes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughing] That's a great name for a cat.

#### Question

Can Hoid change how he looks?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He has...various methods of changing how he looks.

## [Entry #77](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#77)

#### Question

Why does Nightblood need to eat Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, Nightblood is… leaky, is how would say it.

#### Question

Does his sheath help with this somehow?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #78](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#78)

#### Question

How did Regalia establish contact with Calamity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think I’ll save that for the next series I am doing.

## [Entry #79](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#79)

#### Question

In Alloy of Law, I noticed that when Marsh is talking to Marasi, he says that Wax is doing his brother’s work, is that referring to Harmony or Kelsier?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s referring to Kelsier in that quote, in his opinion at the moment. I don’t know if I agree with it. He feels that Wax is protecting the people, the little people, which was Kelsier’s work. In his opinion, which is kind of lofty.

## [Entry #80](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1151#80)

#### Question

Are the shadows, are the physical ghosts in Threnody, the same as Cognitive Shades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are a very, very similar breeds.
