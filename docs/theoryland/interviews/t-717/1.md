# [Interview #717: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=717#1)

#### Jason Denzel

In the short time in between when Brandon Sanderson signed a deal with Tor and Harriet to complete
*A Memory of Light*
, and when that news was announced, I had the privilege to be able to talk to Brandon and ask him some questions over email. At the time of this interview, Brandon was preparing to fly out to Robert Jordan's home in Charleston, South Carolina to meet Harriet and become fully immersed in the world of The Wheel of Time.
