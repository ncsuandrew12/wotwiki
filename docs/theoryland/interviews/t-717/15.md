# [Interview #717: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=717#15)

#### Jason Denzel

And now, just for fun:

Who's nastier: Moridin, or Padan Fain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No contest: Moridin. You can't really top Ishamael when it comes to nastiness, particularly if his opponent is just a little Darkfriend weasel. Yeah, Padan Fain facilitated the attack on Emond's Field and all that, but he's still just a weasel.
