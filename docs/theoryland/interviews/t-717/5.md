#### Jason Denzel

What was your initial reaction when you read the outline Harriet put together for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually haven't seen it yet. All I know is that there IS an outline, as well as some other material that Mr. Jordan gave via dictation. I'm flying out to sort through it and speak with Harriet, and will probably be there when this interview goes public on Monday the 10th.
