# [Interview #717, Entry #2]: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=717#2)

#### Jason Denzel

Congratulations on receiving this landmark opportunity. How are you feeling?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Honestly? I'm feeling daunted. And still a little sad. There was only one person who could have written this book the way it was supposed to be written, and he is gone now. I think I'll do a good job (to be honest, I think I'll do a great job) but I can't do the job he would have done. Nobody can.
