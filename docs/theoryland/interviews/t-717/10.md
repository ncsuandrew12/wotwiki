#### Jason Denzel

Which characters or plot threads are you most looking forward to writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Time turns. The most exciting thing for me will be to tie the events of this last book back to those of the first book, as I think that is what this story is all about. On a more personal note, Perrin has always been a favorite of mine. I think his story is the one I'm most looking forward to resolving.
