# [Interview #717: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=717#22)

#### Jason Denzel

Brandon, I'm sure I speak for all the Wheel of Time fans out there when I say thank you very much for being willing to help finish this series we all love so dearly. We wish you all the best, and we hope you'll find some time in your busy writing schedule to drop in at the various fan sites to say hi. You have a legion of fans cheering you on. As Moiraine told Rand in her final (ahem) words to him ... "You will do well."

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you, Jason. I'm going to do my best on this, I promise. I'm actually a registered member of Dragonmount, and have even posted on occasionâ€”though mostly I just lurk. (And I've done so for years.)
