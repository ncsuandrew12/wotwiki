#### Jason Denzel

What are some of your favorite scenes in The Wheel of Time series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's probably a cliché to say so, but my favorite is still that opening scene of
*The Eye of the World*
—that's what grabbed me as a fifteen year old boy and said "You NEED to read this book!" Lews Therin standing over the body of his wife while he calls for her, after being driven insane. . . wow.

Though, that one's probably too obvious. There are a lot of others to choose from. The fight between Rand and Be'lal at the end of
*The Dragon Reborn*
was just plain cool. Another of my favorites is the scene where Lan rescues Nynaeve after that whole Moghedien-balefire incident. (I can't even remember which book that is right now.) Oh, and pretty much anything with Perrin in the later books. Not to mention the cleansing of
*saidin*
.
