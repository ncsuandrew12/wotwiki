#### Jason Denzel

How should fans get in touch with you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

www.brandonsanderson.com is my website. If they want to check out my books and see what they're all about, they can visit and read sample chapters. I even have a free ebook for download there. There is an email link on the front page, and anyone is free to contact me. Know that I'm contractually obligated to not reveal any plot points of this book, and so I won't be able to give them any hints or clues about the upcoming novel.

I read all of my mail, and I try to respond to all of it. Readers can also find me via my forums, also linked from my website. My blog updates regularly, and is mirrored to my Livejournal (where comments are enabled) and to my Facebook.
