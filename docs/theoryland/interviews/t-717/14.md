# [Interview #717: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=717#14)

#### Jason Denzel

Robert Jordan has talked many times about how he knew the last chapter of the last book very well. Are you able to tell us whether or not he wrote that chapter before he died, or will that be something you'll be putting to paper? If so, does that chapter in particular hold any particular challenge or significance for you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I spoke of this above, actually. I don't know for absolute certain, and I'm not sure how much I could say if I did know. However, what I've heard indicates that of all the parts of the book, the ending is the one that is the nearest to completed, if not done itself.
