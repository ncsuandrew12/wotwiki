#### Jason Denzel

I know you probably can't go too deeply into it, but are there any questions about the story you had as a fan that you will make sure get answered in this final novel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Who the flip killed Asmodean? And, beyond that, what's up with Moiraine? Is she alive or not?
