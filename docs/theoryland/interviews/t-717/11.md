# [Interview #717: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=717#11)

#### Jason Denzel

Are there any particular aspects of the book that you think will be especially challenging for you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first is the depth of the setting. Though I've read these books several times, there is just SO MUCH to wrap your head around. Sitting here and thinking, I'm getting names mixed up and trying to remember just who is alive and who is dead. Obviously, I'm going to have to read the series through a few more times to get it all down, and I'm certainly glad for the Internet and the resources fans have created. I suspect you'll find me on Dragonmount occasionally asking for someone to look up an obscure fact or name for me!

The other item of particular challenge is the worry that I'll disappoint the fans. I am confident in my writing, but. . .wow. This is like being the final man at bat in the last inning of the World Seriesâ€”I'm the guy who has to step up and either strike out get a hit to win. All of my training, practice, and studies are coming to a head.

I don't want to be the guy who ruined The Wheel of Time. I'll work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen.
