# [Interview #89: TPOD Signing Report - Justin Howell, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=89#2)

#### Robert Jordan

#### Footnote

RJ managed to slip the 'FO' into the next book. A careful reading of 'A Lily in Winter' answers the question of what Elayne was doing when she was blacked out.
