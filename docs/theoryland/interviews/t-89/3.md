# [Interview #89, Entry #3]: TPOD Signing Report - Justin Howell](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=89#3)

#### Drew Gillmore

The popular "are you sure we should be able to figure out who killed Asmodean" question used up my second trip through the line. Next time through I asked about the chronology of Eharon and Shiota, since Bashere describes statues from Eharon as being much older than the Shiotan statue put on the cover. We know Deane was born in the village of Salidar in Eharon (Glossary from
*Lord of Chaos*
, IIRC), yet part of Bashere's lecture mentioned that Shiota also was pre-Hawkwing.

#### Robert Jordan

It turns out there is a textual inconsistency here. RJ couldn't remember which comes first (apparently historical details aren't as engrossing for him as for me), but one was part of the Ten Nations, and the other covered the same area (Illian + Altara) between the Trolloc Wars and Hawkwing. He said the Guide has the correct order, though since I don't have the Guide I don't know what that order is. A minor error, really; either that statue was from Eharon and Bashere mentioned much older Shiotan statues, or Deane was Shiotan and the statues were as written.
