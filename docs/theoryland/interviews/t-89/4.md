# [Interview #89: TPOD Signing Report - Justin Howell, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=89#4)

#### Robert Jordan

As Paul mentioned, RJ mumbled something about Sammael. My interpretation is simply that he meant "right, he's dead, whatever you say", but I can see how one might take it more seriously. I'll believe my favorite male character died when I see him come back in a new body sucking up to Moridin, at which point I'll go looking for a new favorite male character (Mat or Demandred, probably).
