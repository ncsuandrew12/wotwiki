# [Interview #23: LOC Signing Report - Viren R. Shah, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=23#6)

#### Viren R. Shah

I'm sure that someone else in Atlanta [Erica?? Danny??] will have the interview recorded and will post it. Most of these points we already know from past interviews, so we didn't gain as much info as I'd have liked to hear.

Anything that I've gotten wrong is definitely 'cause of my recollection, not anything else.
