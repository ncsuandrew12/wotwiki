# [Interview #23: LOC Signing Report - Viren R. Shah, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=23#2)

#### Robert Jordan

As regards Randland being the future/part of our world, he made a reference to the game 'Chinese Whispers'. He said that, like in the game, the happenings of our time/age will be changed/twisted [my words] into Randland's myths, and similarly the occurrences in Randland will/have become our myths.

He also mentioned the fact that he tried to 'reverse-engineer' [his word] the current myths that we have into WoT's happenings/history, and our history into WoT's myths.
