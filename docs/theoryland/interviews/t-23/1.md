# [Interview #23: LOC Signing Report - Viren R. Shah, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=23#1)

#### Viren R. Shah

I'm sure someone's gonna post the whole interview on here, but I caught about 8-10 minutes of it, and I'll try and write down the points I remember [I was kinda occupied at the moment, so my recollection might not be too good].

#### Robert Jordan
