#### Question

You mentioned in your newsletter that you were thinking of doing a
*Mistborn*
film, and I'm wondering because it's an internal magic system, how you would differentiate which metal was being burned?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We've got a couple of tricks up our sleeve that we've been working on. One thing that we're changing in the screenplay is, when you burn iron and steel it makes metals glow blue rather than shooting out blue lines. Basically this will keep it less cluttered, and you can kind of dim the screen a little bit and show everything glowing blue. We're doing that, and when you start burning one of the, for instance, one of the metals that influences personality, we're gonna actually kind of like send a pulse out of the person, and have it kind of wash across people, and things like that, so we're coming up with visual clues to show them.
