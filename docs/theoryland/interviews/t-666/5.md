# [Interview #666: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Green Hoodie Mistborn, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=666#5)

#### Green Hoodie Mistborn

Is there any relation between the smoke that is emitted when a Shardblade cuts somebody and the smoke that Nightblood emits in Warbreaker?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there is. You've been...are you a 17th Sharder?

#### GREEN HOODIE MISTBORN

Yeah.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That's a really smart question. [laughter] If you're not aware of this and you're kind of baffled by this, people have figured out that all of my books are connected, and there is a continuing character who was in
*Elantris*
who shows up in
*Mistborn*
who also is in
*Warbreaker*
and
*The Way of Kings*
. This person is trying to figure out some of the connections between the worlds.
