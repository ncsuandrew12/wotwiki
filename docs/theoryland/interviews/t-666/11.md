# [Interview #666: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Green Hoodie Mistborn, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=666#11)

#### Question

I’ve always wondered what Atium looks like when you’re burning it, do you have possible things coming out of you or do have one shadow just walking out or like an accordion of shadows?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I see one shadow that bursts out that leaves a trail, so like a really faint blur, and then the one shadow in the front, for each...and yeah, if you've got like two Atiums then it's a whole bunch of those, but I see one shadow with a blur of all the pieces and things behind it.
