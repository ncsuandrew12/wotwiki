# [Interview #433: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: The Gathering Storm Chapter 1 + More, Parsec Award, Geekarati, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=433#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

My excellent webmaster and brother, Jordan, has added an
[Events page](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/events)
to the site. I know, people have been asking for a page like that for a while—well, it's finally here! Right now it's got all the dates and locations for my
[*The Gathering Storm*](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/The-Gathering-Storm)
tour, as well as an appearance at
[the Book Academy](http://www.uvsc.edu/conted/c&w/bookacademy/)
writing conference later this month and a couple more signings in December (effectively though not technically part of the tour). This page will automatically update itself to remove events that are already past, so it's a good way to
[keep yourself updated](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/events)
on where I'm going to be.

At Dragon\*Con this past weekend there were a slew of
*The Gathering Storm*
-related announcemnts from Tor Books and Tor.com, the first of which is that
[chapter one of the book](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=story&id=53532)
is now available for free over at
[Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=story&id=53532)
(free registration required). The prologue to the book (which is much longer than the first chapter, at somewhere around 25,000 words) will be released on September 17 as an ebook, as were the prologues of other recent volumes. Tor also announced the availability of all the books in the Wheel of Time as ebooks, starting with
*The Eye of the World*
on October 27, and a subsequent volume following each month after that—and each ebook will feature new cover art. And finally Tor announced the organization of fan volunteer Storm Leaders for each city of my upcoming tour. For more information on all of these topics, please check out
