# [Interview #226: KOD Signing Report - Robert Mee, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=226#10)

#### Robert Mee

Verin is NOT, nor has she ever been, a librarian of the Thirteenth Depository. I got a DIRECT ANSWER, not a RAFO. My question was "Was Verin a librarian of the Thirteenth Depository?" (To include both past and present).

#### Robert Jordan

The response was "No." ...which I followed up with "So she's just a bit weird and knows a lot?" and that response was "Pretty much."
