# [Interview #440: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Alcatraz 3, Maze Runner, Names, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=440#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here are a few items I thought I'd let you guys know about. First off, remember that there's a signing this Saturday at 2:00. It's the release party for
*Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallica*
. The book is pretty much sold out across Utah, so if you want one, this is the best place to get it. I'll be numbering the copies there (though I won't be starting at #1, as a few people have already gotten to me for signatures—I think we're on #4.). The bookstore will have plenty of copies, which are pretty much (as far as I've seen) the last available copies in the state. So, come get some books! As always, I'll be signing all my other books too.

I think this is my last Utah signing before the tour for
*The Gathering Storm*
. So it's your last chance to chat with me and get books signed in a more relaxed atmosphere.

Secondly,
[James Dashner](http://jamesdashner.blogspot.com/)
—a good friend of mine and an excellent writer—just released what is hands-down the finest book of his career so far. It's called
[*The Maze Runner*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385737947/?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
, and I absolutely loved it. I've read a number of James's books, but this one is on a different level entirely.

It's in the YA postapocalyptic genre—so, like
[*The Hunger Games*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0439023483/?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
. It's about a group of boys who wake up without memories trapped inside an enormous maze filled with deadly traps. It's getting
[a big push from the publisher](http://www.randomhouse.com/teens/mazerunner/)
, so if you follow YA, you'll probably hear a lot about it in the near future. Really, it's an excellent novel. If you're a fan of fast-paced thriller-style writing, I think you'll enjoy it.
