# [Interview #798: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: June is Audiobook Month, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=798#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Readers have been asking if my forthcoming novellas
[*Legion*](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/Legion)
and
[*The Emperor's Soul*](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/The-Emperors-Soul)
will be released in audio versions. The answer is that they will be—we have deals made for these, but I'm not sure how quickly the audiobooks will be released compared to the book versions. I'll let you know when I have more details.
