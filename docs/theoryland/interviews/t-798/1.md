#### Brandon Sanderson

Readers have been asking if my forthcoming novellas
[*Legion*](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/Legion)
and
[*The Emperor's Soul*](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/The-Emperors-Soul)
will be released in audio versions. The answer is that they will beâ€”we have deals made for these, but I'm not sure how quickly the audiobooks will be released compared to the book versions. I'll let you know when I have more details.
