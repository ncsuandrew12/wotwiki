# [Interview #798, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: June is Audiobook Month](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=798#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

All of my books are now out in audio editions, including the last three Alcatraz books that were missing audiobooks for a few years. There are two different kinds of audiobooks of mine that have come out: standard unabridged readings (from Macmillan Audio and Recorded Books) and full-cast dramatizations (from GraphicAudio). Which type each book has depends on how contracts were negotiated.

Recorded Books has unabridged readings of
[*Elantris*
,
*Warbreaker*
