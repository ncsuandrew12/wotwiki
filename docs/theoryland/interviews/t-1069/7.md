#### Question

Why is Vasher on Roshar? Is he trying to get back Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kind of a RAFO. I won't go into all his reasons right now but there is one thing that was difficult to get on Nalthis that is much easier to get on Roshar. Going to Roshar solved that problem for him.
