#### Question

If a non Windrunner picked up Jezrien's honorblade would they gain Windrunner powers as well?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

If a Windrunner picked up that blade, would their abilities be enhanced?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There would be some compounding but strength is not as much an issue with surgebinding as is the strength of the spren bond and how much Stormlight you are using.
