# [Interview #1069: WoR Signing Report - Awesomeness Summoned, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#10)

#### Question

How much more powerful is Nightblood than a a regular Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I haven't actually quantified that in my own mind so can't give an accurate comparison at this point. I will say that when he is fully consuming Investiture he can do some really freaky things.

#### Footnote

In the past Brandon has described Nightblood as being "magnitudes more invested than a shardblade".
