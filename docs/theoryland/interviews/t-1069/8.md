# [Interview #1069: WoR Signing Report - Awesomeness Summoned, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#8)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

Why did you put Nightblood in The Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood and Vasher were in the original version of the Way of Kings before I wrote Warbreaker. Warbreaker in a way was actually introducing those two characters I'd already created.
