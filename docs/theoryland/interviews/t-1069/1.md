# [Interview #1069: WoR Signing Report - Awesomeness Summoned, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#1)

#### Awesomeness Summoned

I was at the Houston signing last night and recorded the entire book signing Q&A's. Some of these have already been posted above but here is all the WoB from the event. I left out most of the ones we already knew and some are paraphrased since they were hard to hear the exact wording but there was some good info last night. Enjoy!
