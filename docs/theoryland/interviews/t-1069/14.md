#### Question

Lift is my favorite character even though she was only in that one chapter.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will see much more of Lift in the future. Lift is seeded there because she will be very important later on.

#### Footnote

Brandon has said that Lift will be one of the focus/flashback characters for the "back five".
