# [Interview #1069: WoR Signing Report - Awesomeness Summoned, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1069#27)

#### Question

In the chapter 84 code, does the sequence 111 denote a special character such as a space between words

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not believe there is a 111 to separate words unless it was added by Peter when I wasn't looking.

Is this a question from the 17th Shard?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will say this, the key is in another epigraph.

#### Footnote

The code in question was decoded by Darmad of the 17th Shard
