#### Question

Where was Pattern before Shallan drew him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was around. The bonding process had started when Shallan was young but then she pushed him away and he withdrew mostly to the Cognitive Realm until the bonding was started again and she pulled him fully into the Physical when she drew him.
