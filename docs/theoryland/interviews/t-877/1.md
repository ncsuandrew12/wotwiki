# [Interview #877: AMOL Signing Report - khaosbringer, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=877#1)

#### khaosbringer

So, I was lucky enough to get to go to the
*Memory of Light*
signing in Lexington at Joseph-Beth on January 11th.

When I was getting some books personalized, I told him how much I really liked the characterization of Androl and Perava.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He told me that Androl was a fun character for him to write, because it was his "own" Asha'man.

When he agreed to finish WoT, as he was looking over his notes, he asked if he could create an Asha'man to do with what he wanted. Thus, Androl.

He also talked about how Perava was his idea of how the Red Ajah would make their way in the world after the taint was gone from
*saidin*
.

#### khaosbringer

Granted, they were relatively minor characters, but they had the best side story in the final three books, IMHO.
