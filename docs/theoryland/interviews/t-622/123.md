I am a fellow local author and my first novel just debuted on July 31, 2011. Would you consider me as a candidate for your podcast? If so, how do I go about setting up the air-time?

Also, what avenues have you found to be most successful for promoting your personal writings?

Send me an email. I'd be happy to consider you. We record in batches, these days, because we need to fly Mary out to join us. Next batch is in November.

I found the best promotion was to visit bookstores, meet with their science fiction or fantasy reader on staff, and give them a free book. Other than that, writing great books, trying to have an active website, and avoiding the 'pushy' self-promotion methods such as thread hijacking or the like.

I suppose I should probably post a link to myself so you know who I am...

The only self-published person we've had on was Larry Correia, and that was after he had a book deal (I think) so it might be good to have you on and talk about the self-publishing process. I'll have to run it by the others. Can you send me a digital copy to look over?
