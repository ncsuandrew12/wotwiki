Back in books 4-6, I forget exactly where, Elayne and Nynaeve did a dreamworld need walk to find something to tie the rebel Aes Sedai to Rand. They eventually found the Bowl of the Winds, but before they did, they were taken to the '
*angreal*
storeroom in the White Tower. I ask with every intention of getting a RAFO; is this going to be brought up?
