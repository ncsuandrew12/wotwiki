What are 5 epic fantasy series or stand alone books you'd recommend?

Suggestions (Not including my work, or Wheel of time, which are given.) 1)
*Tigana*
. Genius. Actually, most everything by Guy Kay. 2) Melanie Rawn's
*Sunrunner*
books. (Warning, they're a little romancy.) 3) Jim Butcher's
*Codex Alera*
. 4)
*Dragonsbane*
, Barbara Hambly. (The book that got me into fantasy.) 5)
*Name of the Wind*
.
