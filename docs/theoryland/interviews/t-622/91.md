Will you please continue to write until they nail your coffin shut, just like RJ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I want, when I die, them to find me sitting in my chair with my face having fallen on the keyboard and having just typed seven thousand pages worth of the letter 'Z.' In this way, I'll have written even after I die.

If you do happen to croak before your time, take care on which letter(s) your face ends up on. The fandom will be overanalyzing your choice for years to come.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah. My kids will probably try to publish it as my final novel...
