I really enjoyed
*Warbreaker*
, in fact I bought the hard copy when it first came out, and I would love to see another book in this world. The way that it ends is an obvious gateway into another adventure and leaves with so much potential. Have you ever thought about going back to expand on this world?

There will be a second book in the series (though that is the end) eventually.
