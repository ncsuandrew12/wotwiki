Which of the many characters you have written do you like the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a tough call. You kind of get into a character's head, and enjoy them all. I had a blast with Mat in
*Towers of Midnight*
, where I feel I finally started to get him 'right.' But each book has characters that are just plain fun to write. (Kelsier in the first Mistborn, Sazed in the last.) I can't really chose.
