Just out of curiosity—which subreddits are you subscribed to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, boy. A lot.

vMany of the standards, but not politics or atheism. May of the writing related, fantasy and sf. Artisan and artisan videos. Depthhub (love it) and true reddit (also very good.) In depth stories, food for thought. First world problems always makes me laugh. F7U12 is a guilty pleasure. Parenting, specart, LDS. Most of the the ones dedicated to my work or the WoT. Worldbuilding. And some others like unto the ones above.
