We see the know that Dragonmount was created when Lews Therin killed himself. I've always thought this to be 100% an effect of the way he killed himself, but now I'm doubting that to be the whole story. In his death, did Lews Therin's connection to the Land as the Dragon affect the earth in any way? Did his connection contribute to any of the destruction after his death, or even the creation of Dragonmount?

#### Brandon Sanderson

His connection was an influence, but not the primary one. He really did build Dragonmount with the Power.
