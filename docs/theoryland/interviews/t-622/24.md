I was wondering whether you volunteered to finish the Wheel of Time or if you were approached and asked to finish it. Also do you find it difficult to set aside your own projects in order to complete it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was approached. I didn't know I was being considered until Harriet called me on the phone. The hardest part was putting aside all of the quirky little side projects I was working on. I decided I could still go forward with some of my main projects (
*The Way of Kings*
as an example) but would set aside the smaller things. It was tough. It was worth it, but tough.

I'll still get to them someday.
