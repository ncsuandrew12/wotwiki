Are Rand and Aviendha going to get some time on screen together in
*A Memory of Light*
? They had such an interesting dynamic and they have barely spoken for several books.

RAFO. (You knew that was coming, eh?)

Though...it should be noted that prophecy says that Aviendha will have Rand's children...so, that's going to be kind of tough if they don't see one another again.
