Who do you enjoy reading?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I like reading very widely, however my first love of sf/f basically holds the majority of my reading time. It kind of rubs me wrong when I hear of an author who doesn't read in their own genre. It feels like a doctor, not caring to stay up to date on what other doctors are doing.

My favorite living writer is Terry Pratchett. Most recently, I read a big chunk of the Hugo-nominated works this year so that I could vote intelligently on the awards.

#### Footnote

Brandon was probably thinking of Terry Goodkind, who claims not to read fantasy (while also
[claiming](http://cgi1.usatoday.com/mchat/20030805003/tscript.htm)
that most fantasy isn't as good as his, which by the way isn't actually fantasy).
