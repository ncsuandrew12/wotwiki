Brandon, when are you coming to the Netherlands (or an other country in Europe for that matter)? I'd love to meet you some day...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was actually in the Netherlands this summer. (Sorry if I missed you.)

This goes for anyone else—if you want to know when I'll be visiting your area, drop me an email through my website and ask to be on the mailing list. (Also, tell me generally where you live.) I don't spam. I send out specific emails to people when I visit their country/city.

I'll be back in Europe this November to do a tour in the UK. I should be in France again next year. (I was there this summer, as well as last fall.)

#### Athara

Oh no! I can't believe I missed you! Where were you? I'll drop you an email. Thanks for your reply!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It was kind of unannounced. I was in Paris traveling to Oslo in late May, and I had a 10 hour layover in Amsterdam. So I tweeted to people in the city, had my assistant send an email to any who were on my mailing list from the Netherlands, then went out and

and went/ to dinner with them. Then I signed books, went back to the airport, reclaimed my luggage and got on the plane. It was awesome.
