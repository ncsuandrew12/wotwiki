On your Twitter you said that the bar for
*A Memory of Light*
is around 48%; I just want to thank you for putting the effort the book deserves into it, and I was just wondering how long approximately it will take to finish writing? I just don't like guesstimating because I'm usually way off. Absolutely love your work!

For a lot of books, I go faster and faster as I approach the ending.

My goal for this one is to be done November 8th, when I go on tour. That means doing about 5% a week, or 15k words. At six days a week, that's very doable. Assuming I don't do any more day-long reddit AMAs...

Fast speed for me is 4k a day. Slow is about 1.5k.
