I am coming to the Seattle signing for
*Alloy of Law*
. Do you think you'll have time for MTG on this tour? Should I bring my cards? =D

I'll bring mine, but I've got to be frank with you. In Seattle it's hard to find time to play, since I usually end up visiting Google or Microsoft, then going to dinner with friends. (Ken lives there, for example.) So...I'll try, but I can't make promises.
