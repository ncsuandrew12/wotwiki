Do you still have your beard from ComicCon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Still have it.

Question about the beard: Do you think it has the potential to rival Patrick Rothfuss's?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Ha. No, no, probably not. I'm going to grow it out long enough to do some pictures with my brother, who wants some shots of the two of us with big curling mustaches. Then I'll trim it down. I don't like bushy beards; they get in the way of things.
