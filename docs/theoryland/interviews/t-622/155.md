I saw in the thread advertising this IAMA that you offered Kaladin\_Stormblessed to use his name as a character in your book. What do you think about doing (like other authors do) some sort of a donation drive where people will donate to a charity of your choice in return for having their name as a character in your books?

I do it frequently. I think it's a good way to give readers what they want, and to also do a good thing. And there is a very long, grand tradition of it in sf/f. It's hard to take some 'I'm an artist and won't do that kind of thing' stance when a large number of the grand masters of the genre did it.
