Will new versions of the Wheel of Time books be printed with the Ebook covers after
*A Memory of Light*
is released?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm pushing for it. Harriet is hesitant. She wants a re-release with something like the UK covers, more symbolic and classy. I kind of prefer the ebook covers, myself, though I wouldn't mind the UK covers.
