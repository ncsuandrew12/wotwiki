How often is a "weeping" in
*Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Once a year. Opposite it in the year is an extremely powerful highstorm.

When, relatively to the events in
*Way of Kings*
is/will be the nearest Weeping? (I ask, because I started wondering, if this powerful storm was, coincidentally, the one, during which... you know... the face in the clouds and all that.)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Well, there are ten months in year. If I haven't mentioned dates in the last book (I may or may not have) I am planning to in the next. So a timeline should be possible for fans to figure out...
