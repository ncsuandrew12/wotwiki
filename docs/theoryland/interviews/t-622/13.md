#### Terez

Why did Moiraine's bond with Lan break when the doorway burned? Did she intentionally release it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She did not intentionally release it. RJ has something about this in the notes, but I don't have the quote handy. It basically has to do with the severing of the link between worlds.
