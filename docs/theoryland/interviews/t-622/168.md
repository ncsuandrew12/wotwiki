Was Vallano, Szeth's grandfather, also a Truthless? And if not, what did he do to disgrace the Shin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, Vallano was not Truthless.

Szeth was a very respected member of his society, once. There are clues to what happened in his story, but you won't hear it in full until he gets his book. (Which will include his flashbacks.)
