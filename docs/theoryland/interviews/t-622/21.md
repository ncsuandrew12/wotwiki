Am I crazy or was
*A Memory of Light*
originally slated for November of this year?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it was originally. After how hard it was to get
*Towers of Midnight*
out on time (and after using up all of my 'buffer' by having books written and in the publication process before I started on
*The Gathering Storm*
) we revised that date. It was just too much to do. Next year sometime for sure, though.
