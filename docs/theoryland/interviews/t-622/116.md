Turn about is fair play: can you think of anyone who you would choose to take over if you were for whatever reason unable to finish the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are plenty of great authors. Pat Rothfuss would be my first choice, but I doubt he would be the right one, as he has his own series and our writing styles are different enough. It would probably be someone newer at the time, like I was. All of the authors I can think of (Weeks, Butcher) are too busy in their own right to want to deviate by jumping into someone else's huge series.
