Will
*A Memory of Light*
be released as an e-book at the same time as the hardcover next year, or will we have to wait?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's unlikely. Harriet has much worry about the ebook format, and the fact that we wouldn't have gotten #1 on the
*New York Times*
list if we'd done the ebook release at the same time has her extra jumpy. She released the ebook earlier than expected by my request last time, and I think we'll get it even earlier this time. But it probably won't be at the same time.

(Though, it may depend on how the
*Times*
counts ebooks then. Harriet feels it's important for RJ's legacy that these last few books continue the string of being #1 hits.)
