What's your favorite webcomic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

How about my top five? I go back and forth on rankings.

1) Dr. McNinja 2) Sam and Fuzzy 3) Schlock Mercenary 4) Order of the stick 5) Uh...Sinfest or SMBC (I guess it's my top six.)

Really digging Kate Beaton lately, but man, she's worse than Order of the Stick at updating. And that's saying something.
