How did finding out the ending(s) to The Wheel of Time affect you personally? I feel like I have known these characters for so many years, and to not have something else to look forward to is going to be so weird for me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I felt, reading it, that Robert Jordan's ending was deeply satisfying. I liked it a lot. It is also weird to know that, to one extent, it's all over.

I realize this is an older thread, but I just wanted to say how pleased I am to see this comment. Before I found WoT I never thought I'd enjoy reading. I grew up with this series, and I'm so happy to hear the ending is a good one.

I am a huge fan of your work; especially Mistborn and
*The Way of Kings*
. Thanks for doing the AMA :D.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

My pleasure. Thank you for reading.
