My question has to do with
*Warbreaker*
2 should you ever choose to write it. Will you be releasing it piece by piece and then in its entirety for free online like you did with WB1?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I will be.

#### mgowen

Wait... what!? We already have
*Warbreaker*
1 to recommend to friends as a free trial of your work.

Not that I'm complaining, but why make W2 free too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because it was a part of the experience of writing the book for me. It is something I'd like to try again. (Releasing the book chapter by chapter as I write it.)

#### beetnemesis

Was the
*Warbreaker*
experiment successful? By which I mean, were there more, less, or as many sales as, say,
*Elantris*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More than
*Elantris*
or MB1/MB2 initially, not as many as MB3. Now it's about even with
*Elantris*
. (Expected. Mistborn has the series boost, which makes the entire trilogy sell about double what
*Elantris*
or
*Warbreaker*
do.)
