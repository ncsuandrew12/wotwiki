As readers, we hear a lot about your writing process. But could you talk a little bit about your revision process?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am a goal-based revisionist. I come up with a list of things I want to fix, I rank them in order of import, then I go through the book and read it page one until the end, fixing as I go. Every revision also has the goal of cleaning up the language and fixing the line-by-line.
