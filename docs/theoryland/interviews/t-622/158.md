Do you work on one story until it's done, or do you work on one, then move to another, then come back to the first?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I usually write new material for one book at a time, but will often jump off of that for a while and do edits on another, then come back. With
*A Memory of Light*
, for example, I'll probably finish it in November, write something very short to clear my mind, then come back and do edits while I start working on the second Stormlight book.
