Why do you feel
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
was successful when there are hundreds (maybe even thousands) of other fantasy novels out there that failed?

#### Brandon Sanderson

1) Biggest factor, luck. I'm not the best writer out there. Better writers have had less success. I got lucky. 2) I am a big fan of the genre, and feel that I understood (not intentionally, but just because of what I was) the frustrations of epic fantasy readers with things not happening in the genre. I naturally wrote books that went different ways, and these drew attention. 3) Enough of a personal stamp to stand out.
