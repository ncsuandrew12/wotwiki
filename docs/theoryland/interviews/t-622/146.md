Hello, Mr. Sanderson. I've recently (cca 20 hours ago) sent you a desperate message on your Goodreads account. Can you, please, look at it? Thanks. I too am curious if you are planning a sequel to
*Elantris*
. Thanks for answers.

Your Eternal Fan

Hm. Man I almost never check there. (I try, but I don't always get around to it.) Could you send me an email with the question instead, through my website?
