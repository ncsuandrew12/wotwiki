Do you edit as you go, or write a whole draft, then go back and change things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do very little self-editing as I go. I feel it's important for me to lay down a draft to work with before I start tweaking. The exception is if a character just isn't working. (See my other answer on discovery writing.) In that case, I will sometimes go back, tear the character out and replace them.
