Is there an element of fantasy writing that you particularly enjoy or dislike? For example, do you like worldbuilding more or less than individual character development, or are they "different but equal"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Different but equal depending on the stage. I love planning worlds, but I prefer to discovery write characters. (See
[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/k0fp8/iama_professional_fantasy_novelist_named_brandon/c2gkos4)
for more info.)

During the writing of a book, the character moments are the best. During the planning, the worldbuilding parts are the best.
