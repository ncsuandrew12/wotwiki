Do you ever feel a real desire to just start on the Stormlight Archive 2?
*A Memory of Light*
must have its perks to write but do you ever just want to get stuck in to book two?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I do feel that desire to get on to Stormlight 2. However, this is not a new feeling. In every book—at about the 50% mark or so—I want to be moving on to the next book. By then, I've already done a lot of the exciting things in worldbuilding and discovering characters, but I'm not yet to the exciting ending.

This is a challenge for a lot of writers. I know Neil Gaiman has spoken on it before. I have trained myself to remain focused on the project at hand.

#### Jezrien

Do you ever take breaks away from
*A Memory of Light*
and go over notes and ideas for the next installment of the Stormlight Archive?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, I do take breaks and outline other projects (specifically Stormlight.) But not for long.
