Are there any rogue Heroes of the Horn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on your definition of rogue.

#### Ted Herman

As for definition of rogue, I would say if a Hero was acting intentionally or not to either advance the goals of the Shadow or to interfere with the actions of other Heroes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do not know of any. We can MAFO it, but I'm pretty sure that there are none doing that. They don't all get along, mind you. But I don't believe any of them are Darkfriends.
