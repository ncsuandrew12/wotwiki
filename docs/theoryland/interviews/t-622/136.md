Why sell the movie rights to Mistborn to a relatively unknown producer? I get that they understand your vision for the movie and know how they want to be done, but I kind of think that other people in the movie industry would have been able to make your vision a reality so long as you were a consultant for the movie, and it would be more likely to see the light of day.

When I sold the rights, I was not of the level of fame I now am. That's one consideration. It was the first REAL (as in, willing to up-front serious money) offer I'd had. I also knew that Red Eagle had had success with the WoT, being small and then getting the rights picked up by a large studio.

The producer impressed me a lot. He flew out to meet with me, and had a great vision. My agent and I thought that, getting a deal with a smaller producer and retaining some creative control was worth the risk. The worst that can happen is that a buyout doesn't happen by the end of next year, and the rights come back.
