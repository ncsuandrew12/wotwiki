You've been publishing at an amazing rate for several years, though I understand you've largely exhausted your "buffer"—the books you had written before becoming a published author.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wrote 13 before I got published.
*Warbreaker*
,
*The Way of Kings*
, and Mistborn all took pieces of already written works. (Though I started from scratch in all three cases, stealing out the 'best' of their respective unpublished versions.) I still have two of these (
*White Sand*
and
*Aether of Night*
) that have good enough magic systems or concepts that they will see publication (in one form or another) eventually.
