Any plans to write in another genre such as mystery or historical fiction?

Not currently. Anything I think of that is in another genre usually transforms into sf/f by the end. So, there will probably always be at least SLIGHT sf/f elements. I could see myself doing a
*Jurassic Park*
style thriller, though.
