1. How many of the Heroes of the Horn are currently "in the flesh"?

2. How did the Eye of the World's location move about?

Oh, wow. You're going to make me dig into the notes, aren't you?

Why don't I MAFO those? Send me an email and I'll dig through to get your answers, or will have Maria do it.
