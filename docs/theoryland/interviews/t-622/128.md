# [Interview #622: Reddit AMA 2011, Entry #128](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=622#128)

I read
*A Song of Fire and Ice*
by George R. R. Martin because on the front cover there was praise for the book from Robert Jordan. Are there any books that you would recommend?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Many. I posted a list
[above](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/k0fp8/iama_professional_fantasy_novelist_named_brandon/c2gkqzl)
.

To add to the list: Brent Weeks, Robin Hobb, Pratchett (whom I love, but don't start with the first), Daniel Abraham (warning, some people find him very slow.) Read and really enjoyed
*The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms*
recently.

The thing about suggesting books, however, is that it's hard to make suggestions unless I know what someone likes. Someone who loves GRRM will probably like Joe Abercrombie and Scott Lynch, but might find Babara Hambly to be too bland. On the other hand, someone who likes Robin Hobb may find Hambly right up their alley. It's tough to judge. But those are authors I've liked. (Oh, and Erikson is quite good too; I just haven't read enough of him yet to feel like I'm doing him justice.)

#### Footnote

Brandon talked a little more about Erikson
