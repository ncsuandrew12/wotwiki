How are you able to write so consistently?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I see this phantom cubical chasing me, over my shoulder. If I slow down, it catches me, and I have to go get a regular job and become an insurance salesman or something.

#### IDontWorkForRailroad

Hey now, I sell insurance, it's not that bad!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. I knew someone would say this.

Let me put it this way—you're probably good at it. I'd be terrible. I'd be sitting and thinking of all the books I wanted to be writing all day. It would be miserable. Not because selling insurance is miserable, but because—for me—NOT writing would be.
