# [Interview #703: TPOD Signing Report - Jason Atkinson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=703#3)

#### Jason Atkinson

Other than that, there wasn't much new.

For those that have not been to a signing yet, they really do mean it when they say hardback books only. No signing bookmarks for friends. Sorry. He will sign the weapons from Museum Replicas (which he was rather complimentary of) but I did not see any.
