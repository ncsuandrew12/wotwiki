I just remembered one more thing. My brother, who has just decided to join the newsgroup, asked if Robert Jordan had any of the rules worked out for the games mentioned in his books.

His answer was "Some of them." As RJ was literally walking out at the time, there was no chance to ask which ones or if he would market any of them.
