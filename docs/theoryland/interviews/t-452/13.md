# [Interview #452: Ending The Wheel of Time: The GeekDad Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=452#13)

#### GeekDad

On a related point, you released
[*Warbreaker*
as a Creative-Commons licensed e-book](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/book/Warbreaker)
, and I wondered what you made of that, and whether you would do it again?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will probably do it again. It was a fun experiment, and I think in the long run it helped me. There's no way of knowing whether it hurt sales or helped sales. That's not the sort of thing we can really track. The fan reaction was wonderful, and I think it's a better book for having done it. And I think it was specifically very helpful for a lot of the Wheel of Time fans who came to my website right after they found out that Robert Jordan had passed away and not knowing anything about my booksâ€”being able to get one and see it for free just to see who I am.
