# [Interview #452, Entry #5]: Ending The Wheel of Time: The GeekDad Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=452#5)

#### GeekDad

It's kind of a relief to have a lot of Rand and Egwene and some of the other originals...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's what people have been saying. I'm glad to hear that. I was worried that they would feel the lack of some of the smaller characters, though there are plenty of those. It is a Wheel of Time book, so they're not gone. But there are some people who don't show up. By now, the spoilers are around: Elayne, we don't have any viewpoints from Elayne. There's nothing from Lan. We don't hear anything from Padan Fain, or some of these pretty important lesser characters. (I wouldn't say Elayne is a lesser character, but she's had a couple of books that really do her thing, and so it was time for her to take a back seat, I think, to Rand and Egwene.)
