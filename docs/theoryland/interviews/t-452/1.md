# [Interview #452: Ending The Wheel of Time: The GeekDad Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=452#1)

#### Jason B. Jones

Last week, Tor published
*The Gathering Storm*
, the newest book in Robert Jordan's longrunning Wheel of Time series. To alert, but not devoted readers, this may have come as a bit of a surprise, as Robert Jordan died in 2007. But Jordan had left detailed notes, and even finished scenes (he'd talked for years about having the last scene written), and so the possibility existed of finishing the series, based on those notes. Robert Jordan's wife and editor, Harriet McDougal, selected Brandon Sanderson, in part on the strength of a eulogy Sanderson had written for Jordan. McDougal and Sanderson have discussed this process in an interview.

What was to be the final book has turned into a final trilogy, to be released over the next couple of years, but I don't think there will be any regrets:
*The Gathering Storm*
is a well-paced book that is recognizably true to the Wheel of Time spirit.

Sanderson took time out from the bookâ€™s promotional tour to speak with me by phone on Thursday:
