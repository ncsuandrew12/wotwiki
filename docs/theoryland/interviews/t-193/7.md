As for how this all came together, the writer said the answer is a simple one.

#### Robert Jordan

"I wrote a novella called 'New Spring' for the Bob Silverberg anthology
*Legends*
and the Dabel brothers approached my agent about doing a comic based on that. They had already begun George Martin's 'The Hedge Knight' from that anthology—the issues I saw looked spectacular!—and signed to do Bob Silverberg's story as well. Meanwhile, however, my print publisher, Tor Books, had asked me to expand the novella into
*New Spring: the Novel*
. So I told the Dabel Brothers that I wouldn't sell them the rights to the novella, but I would to the novel, if they were interested in doing something that much longer. It turned out that they were and we were off to the races."
