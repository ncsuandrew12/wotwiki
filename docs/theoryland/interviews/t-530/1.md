# [Interview #530: Postmodernism in Fantasy: An Essay by Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=530#1)

#### Kate Baker

Today is my last day as site manager here at the Whatever. As I prepare to hand the blog back to John, I thought I'd give you a surprise for making me feel so welcome. At first, I was going to tape bacon to my kids, but I figured someone would call CPS on me. Instead I'm happy to present
[Brandon Sanderson](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/)
as a last-minute guest blogger! He has written a terrific and engaging essay concerning postmodernism in fantasy. Which is
*super fantastic*
as I'm taking multiple literature courses this fall. Thanks, Mr. Sanderson!

Brandon Sanderson is the author of
*Elantris*
, the Mistborn trilogy, the Alcatraz series of novels and
*Warbreaker*
. He was personally chosen to complete the Wheel of Time series originally penned by Robert Jordan, with the latest installment due in November. If his packed panels and readings at Dragon\*Con were any indication, he is an author well on his way to rock star status. If you haven't jumped in and bought some of these books, you are truly missing out on wonderful reads. So without further ado, I'll let him talk about his new novel,
*The Way of Kings*
.

You're welcome.
