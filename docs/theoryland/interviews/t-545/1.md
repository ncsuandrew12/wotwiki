# [Interview #545: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Another Long and Rambling Post on Future Books, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=545#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

All,

Let's do a quick (okay, it's me, so it won't be quick) update to let everyone know what's going on here at Dragonsteel Entertainment HQ. (Also known as me sitting on a chair in my bedroom while my eight-month-old son throws half-eaten graham crackers at me.)

Warning, this is another of my trademarked long and rambling blog posts. So, I've put in some arbitrary headings to help break things up and keep it focused. At the bottom, there's a quick timeline of books I'm working on or plan to work on soon.
