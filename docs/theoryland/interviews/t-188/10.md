#### Wotmania

Did Ishamael come to Lews Therin Telamon's palace in the prologue of
*The Eye of The World*
to kill him?

#### Robert Jordan

No. To taunt him with his defeat. Ishamael would much rather have had Lews Therin alive and suffering from the knowledge of defeat, not to mention the murder of his wife and other blood kin, than simply dead.
