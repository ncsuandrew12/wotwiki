#### Wotmania

When publishing, a commonly accepted fact is that good editing leads to good results. How much of your writing do you personally edit out after completion, in general? How much and what sort of things does your editor usually edit out?

#### Robert Jordan

After I finish a book, I edit very little. While I am writing, however, I edit constantly, both in the chapter I am currently working on and in chapters already completed. Whenever I make a major change to a chapter, I save the new version with a higher Revision Number, and it isnâ€™t unusual to have Revision Numbers in the thirties or forties. I once reached Revision ninety-six, but that was on a prologue, and those are a good bit longer than any individual chapter.
