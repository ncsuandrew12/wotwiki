#### Dodge

I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the following people, all without whom this interview would never have taken place:

Jessica from Orbit Booksâ€”the UK's publisher for The Wheel Of Time, who fundamentally arranged and then continued to co-ordinate the Interview.

Etzel of Wotmania, many of whose questions appear below.

Spoonman and Obsidian Ashaman of Wotmania, for their proofreading and suggestions.

And, of course, the wonderful Robert Jordan.

Thank you!
