#### [DaneÂ (13 September 2010)](http://bordersblog.com/scifi/2010/09/13/mira-grant-and-jesse-petersen/we-survived-the-zombie-apocalypse-now-what/)

**We Survived the Zombie Apocalypse, Now What?**

It's that time again where we must say goodbye to our current guests and welcome our new guests. Special thanks to Mira and Jesse who filled the last two weeks with all things zombie. I had a blast reading your posts and getting a peek into your world. Do come back again! If you have any last words (or zombie survival tips, or book plugs), we'd love to hear them.

Next up, we switch focus from the undead to the epic with
*New York Times*
Bestselling authors Brandon Sanderson and Brent Weeks (who have both coincidentally started new series with their recent releases)!

In
*The Way of Kings*
, Brandon Sanderson brings us the first in a ten book epic fantasy series called The Stormlight Archive. Brandon was also one of the very first guests on Babel Clash and we're glad to have him back on the blog.

Brent Weeks is also another Babel Clash alum (who could forget
[Brent's epic debate with Joe Aberbrombie](http://bordersblog.com/scifi/category/brent-weeks-and-joe-abercrombie/)
). Brent's new book is the first in a brand new series featuring Gavin Guile, a prism with only five years to achieve five goals.

Welcome back to Babel Clash, Brandon and Brent. We can't wait to see what you have in store for us.
