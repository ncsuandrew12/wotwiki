#### Brandon Sanderson

Much thanks to everyone who has pointed out to me that the
[Mistborn Two Audiobook just hit Audible](http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_AREN_000919&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes)
. The trilogy is finally complete in this format; I apologize that it took so long to get them all up there.
