#### Interviewer

What do fans tell you they like so much about your writing?

#### Robert Jordan

It's a different thing for every person.

#### Interviewer

Really?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Interviewer

What do the women like?

#### Robert Jordan

The women like the women. I was told by a number of women who came to a signing several years ago that they were surprised to find out that I was a man. They thought no man could write women like that. And I like this because my editor used to say that I couldn't write women at all. I find this a very sweet revenge.
