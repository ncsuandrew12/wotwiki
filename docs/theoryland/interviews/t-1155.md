## [Entry #1](./t-1155/1)

#### Question

So for Calamity, like about these others that you mentioned, are we ever going to figure that out? Or--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah, so the next series I’m doing deals with the greater-- sort of interdimensional travel and who are these people.

#### Question

Okay good, because I was like “You can’t leave me like this” at the very end. I really like how it was put together and stuff. My own theories were that David was, his powers were figuring out Epics’ weaknesses—

#### Brandon Sanderson

I considered that, I really did. At the end of the day, when I brainstormed the trilogy I said you know what would be most fun for me in this series is to do a trilogy that is basically an origin story for a character and then when I come back to The Reckoners, if I do, because the next one’s a parallel dimension, right?

#### Question

From where Firefight is? Or another--

#### Brandon Sanderson

That-- We will get into why certain ones are stable and certain ones aren’t and why Megan can pull from and we’ll do something there with a new character. And if I come back, then Mizzy will be the main character in the sequel series.

#### Question

Awesome, […] looking forward to more Mizzy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Does that make sense? That’s where the plan for this is, we’ll see how the new series goes, they’re announcing it next week. And the entirety of the magic system is based on interdimensional stuff.

#### Question

Right, especially with Megan and her--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep.

#### Question

--multiple hundred personalities coming together and stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So it’s kind of like Megan has opened up this idea of a quantum multiverse, and now I’m going to do a quantum multiverse which is not something I can deal with in the cosmere so it’s exciting for me to be able to do it.

#### Question

Yeah ‘cause the first one we see about the others I was like […] this is not the cosmere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not cosmere. Going straight-up quantum multiverse, in kind of a classical sense. I’ve been doing a lot of reading on string theory and things. It’s so hard, string theory breaks my brain. Quantum mechanics break my brain, but they’re fun.

## [Entry #46](./t-1155/46)

#### Question

Is there a correlation between Awakening steel (Questioner later clarifies that by this he means making Nightblood), and summoning a sprenblade (Brandon tries to get him to clarify, live or dead sprenblade, but I don’t think they ended up on exactly the same page).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone should REALLY verbatim this one… the difference here is in one, you’re pouring Investiture into a physical object, in the other, something closer to pure Investiture is entering our realm and taking on a physical shape. Similar but different things. There is a correlation, but (trails off)

## [Entry #67](./t-1155/67)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someday.

## [Entry #71](./t-1155/71)

#### Question

Question about feruchemy and allomancy… what does it take to match allomantic pewter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He imagines that baseline pewter doubles strength, flaring triples. He wouldn’t imagine someone burning pewter and lifting a car. Hasn’t thought about speed and healing. He’s admitting he hasn’t canonized these things.

## [Entry #72](./t-1155/72)

#### Question

Does atium still do the same thing since Sazed has Ascended?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. If it didn’t, Marsh would be dead.

## [Entry #73](./t-1155/73)

In real life, a man got an iron bar through his head and that changed his personality. Would that happen in the cosmere?

## [Entry #74](./t-1155/74)

#### Question

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not even close.

## [Entry #75](./t-1155/75)

#### Question

#### Brandon Sanderson

You should read Secret History, it talks about that.

## [Entry #76](./t-1155/76)

#### Question

Conflicts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Make conflict and setting important to the character. Making a religion that opposes something the character believes will make instant conflict.

## [Entry #77](./t-1155/77)

#### Question

Favorite food?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mac and Cheese.

## [Entry #78](./t-1155/78)

#### Question

Do you worry that you get too repetitious with words?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, he thinks all authors do. (I totally worry about this.)

## [Entry #79](./t-1155/79)

#### Question

How do you set a scene without describing for pages?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One or two really powerful sentences, let the reader fill in the rest.

## [Entry #80](./t-1155/80)

#### Question

If you were gonna build a Cosmere Avengers, who would you have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He doesn’t wanna talk about this to pre-dispose people. He’d have answered if it weren’t being recorded. He’d want someone from every magic system. Would the name of the team be a spoiler? He says, “I haven’t thought about it.” Then he starts talking about the 17th Shard but stops because the guy thinks this is his answer to the question, it doesn’t seem like he really wanted to give that as the simple answer.

## [Entry #81](./t-1155/81)

#### Question

Would Secret Histories be on other planets?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The next one will probably be on (Cannot tell if he says Scadrial or Nalthis).
