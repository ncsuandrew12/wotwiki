# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#3)

#### Question

Are you ticked you know the ending? (The fans, Brandon, and all of us Storm Leaders laughed!)

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm excited." Brandon, in having Robert Jordan's notes on the whole series, has even seen the
"handwritten note of who killed Asmodean" [I didn't know Robert Jordan knew my name!] A moment with a somewhat quizzical look on his face, Brandon went on to say that he does feel a "sense of loss that I didn't get to read a new Wheel of Time book last week."
