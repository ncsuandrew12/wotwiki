# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#30)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon's advice to writers:
  
—Network. Go to where the editors are, learn names. He describes himself as gregarious.
  
—Write compulsively. Be able to send things out constantly, not every editor will like everything you write.
  
—His advice isn't a "silver bullet" of getting published, but he says to "keep at it."
