# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#14)

#### Question

There's a lot of female influence in the Wheel of Time, was it hard to write from their perspective?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In my early years writing, it was hard. I finally got it right in
*Elantris*
. It was harder to write from other cultures, especially Aviendha and Tuon. It took three tries to get Aviendha right..."Aiel are weird."

Brandon describes Mat dealing with Tuon leaving as Mat having his feet knocked out from under him and says that in Robert Jordan's notes it says specifically that "Mat refuses to become husbandly".
