# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#1)

#### Question

Regarding the
*Mistborn*
books, do you think you will ever write a prequel trilogy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon is hesitant to do so. He has considered it though. He [Brandon] "loves epic fantasy" and the "hero's journey, like Rand's journey at the beginning of the Wheel of Time". When writing the Mistborn books, he knew Robert Jordan had done epic fantasy the best it could be done, so thought to himself, 'what hasnâ€™t been done?' The answer he came to was 'what if the hero [e.g.] Rand/Harry Potter/Frodo lost?' The idea was a good one, but that would make a "downer of a book".

#### Meg Lurvey

(The fans, myself included, chuckled slightly horrified at the idea of the Dark One winning, and one fan made a reference to the Star Wars prequels, which also amused the crowd, and Brandon alike.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon went on to say that he wrote Mistborn as 1000 years after the heroes lost, and he is more strongly considering a sequel trilogy that would take place about 600 years after Mistborn.
