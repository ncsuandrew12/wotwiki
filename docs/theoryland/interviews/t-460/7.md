#### Question

Will we see anywhere in the world a visual representation of The Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A video game is pretty likely. The executive option was bought for full rights as well, and screen plays are being written. Jason Denzel and Maria are consulting. If the films get made, they will be full feature films. There are also comic books put out by the Dabel brothers that are accurate, but they may not continueâ€“the Dabel brothers have "visual genius and financial troubles." [We raffled off three of the comic books to excited fans!]
