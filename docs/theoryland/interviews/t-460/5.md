# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#5)

#### Question

Has Mesaana's alter ego been seen yet "on stage"? [I suspect the fan that asked this is one of the Blues I mentioned earlier, though she may be a Brown, too.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm afraid I'm going to have to RAFO [read and find out] that." Any yes/no would set all the fans, especially on the message boards and fans into figuring it out by process of elimination. The crowd pressed him for hints, and he did confirm that she is still in the White Tower. This statement was met with speculative "oohhh"'s and pensive looks as new theories were born then and there.
