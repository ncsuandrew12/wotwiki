# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#4)

#### Question

Which character's point of view is your favorite to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Whoever I'm writing at that moment", they're the most important. With some characters it was easier than others, as "Cadsuane already believes she's the most important." [I think I laughed the loudest at that remark.] He also said that the notes on Egwene were the most extensive and she was a pleasure to write. He also enjoys having more Aviendha viewpoints, as he missed her, and commented that writing Rand is both dramatic and draining.
