# [Interview #460: TGS Signing Report - Meg Lurvey, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=460#19)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Even Brandon had moments of "Aaaah! I knew it!" He also has had the "wait, really?" moments and often, while going through notes, has said, "Ah, that group is right!" [Referring to groups on the message boards.] He also confided that there is one thing that isn't being discussed on any of the forums yet that will blow our minds when we read it. Yay!
