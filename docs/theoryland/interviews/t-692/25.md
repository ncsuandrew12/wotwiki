# [Interview #692: 17th Shard Interview, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=692#25)

#### 17th Shard

Joe from the U.K. asks a terrifying question, "If an Allomancer is turned into a koloss, would they keep their powers?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

If an Allomancer is turned into a koloss? You know...

#### 17TH SHARD

We're scared of this

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, no. That's actually something I've thought about. An Allomancer turned into a koloss would keep their powers because, as you'll recall, an Allomancer turned in to an Inquisitor retains their powers. Whether they would be able to always know how to use them remains to be seen, but you could definitely have a koloss Allomancer if you built them right.
