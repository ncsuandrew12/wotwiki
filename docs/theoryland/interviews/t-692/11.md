# [Interview #692: 17th Shard Interview, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=692#11)

#### 17th Shard

Just in general, how is Stormlight Archive related to the rest of the cosmere? Or can you say?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will tell you that one of the novels I skipped is actually set in the same solar system.

#### 17th Shard

Oh...so this is the series that that book shares.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, this is the series that the book shares that I skipped. I was planning to do it first, but now was the time to do the Stormlight Archive. So you will eventually see a book set on a planet in the same solar system. You could just pick out in the sky of Roshar if you were watching when ..., and it may even get mentioned because it's a fairly close planet.

#### 17th Shard

Is that on Divine Silence?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Silence Divine*
happens there.

#### 17th Shard

What is the name of that planet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hmm...should I tell you?

#### 17th Shard

Yes!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Peter says no.

#### 17th Shard

(laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

You got PAFO'd.

#### 17th Shard

(laughter continues) Go ask Peter and find out.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it's like, Peter and not find out.

#### 17th Shard

(still laughing) PANFO.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, PANFO'd, Peter and not find out. Good.

#### 17th Shard

(more laughter) We just won't leave.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, so, I will tell you the name of that planet once it is out like I've told you the rest of them.

#### 17th Shard

Ok, fair enough.
