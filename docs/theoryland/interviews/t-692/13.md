#### 17th Shard

Can you elaborate more on cadmium and bendalloy's effects? Like, if you're speeding up time, are you speeding up time for you in the bubble or what?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anything in the bubble.

#### 17TH SHARD

Okay.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You create a space around you of sped-up space-time, and anything that gets in there moves more slowly. Like, let's say that I shot a bullet at you and you popped it with sped-up time. That bullet would move really slowly. Everything around you would be slowed. Ah, no, but you would be the same so when the bullet entered it would go the same speed that you are going, but once it's out, it's either faster or slower. Does that make sense?

#### 17TH SHARD

Yeah, it does, it does.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Reversed, yeah. It can have some really powerful effects, but the problem is, you can't change anything. As soon as you get close enough to change it, it's in there with you. So, if you were using it the right way you could dodge bullets, as long as you were able to get it off before the bullet got too close to you, but that's hard to do.

#### 17TH SHARD

Yeah, that would be the trick.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

And, if you're the one who can slow time, you could get someone in your bubble and slow time, then let everyone else move more quickly around you, which, of course, takes a lot more practice to use. You've got to have a buddy who's outside the bubble but who you could stop, he could stop you, and we would see time move the same but everything around us would go super fast. If people were ready for that they could make use of it.

#### 17TH SHARD

That has a lot of usesâ€¦

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah.
