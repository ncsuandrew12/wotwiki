# [Interview #692: 17th Shard Interview, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=692#16)

#### 17th Shard

You said it was because of your work on The Wheel of Time that you were able to do this story justice. What did you mean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wheel of Time forced me to stretch as an author and it forced me to learn to juggle multiple viewpoints. I hadn't had a lot of practice writing sequels or planning sequels, and then I had to write the twelfth book in a fourteen book series. This taught me a lot about working with sequels. Also, seeing what Robert Jordan did for foreshadowing really taught me a lot about how to foreshadow across a big long epic. But I would say mostly it's just juggling the viewpoints, learning how to make sure all the characters are making appearances and we're enjoying them all and everything is balanced all without losing track.
