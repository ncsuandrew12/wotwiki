# [Interview #692: 17th Shard Interview, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=692#6)

#### 17th Shard

You've told us that you took the idea of the Shattered Plains from
*Dragonsteel*
into
*Way of Kings*
and reading
*Way of Kings*
it's hard to imagine the book without them. What did Roshar look like without them? Can you walk us through the process of moving that concept from that series to this one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it looked pretty much like it looks in the books, but
*Way of Kings Prime*
takes place mostly in Kholinar and in a location that has not yet been talked about in the books.

Ah...it took place in another location, how about that?

One of the big things with this book is, as I was saying, that I think I started [
*Way of Kings Prime*
] in the wrong place. I moved some things back in time and some things forward in time. For instance, if you ever read
*Way of Kings Prime*
, the prologue to
*Way of Kings Prime*
is now the epilogue to
*The Ways of Kings*
. You know, the thing that happens in the epilogue with the thumping on the door and the arrival of a certain individual? That scene is now from Wit's viewpoint which it wasn't before. Pull Wit out of that scene and you'll get almost exactly [what happened] in the [original] prologue. So, the timing has been changed around a lot.

As I was playing with this book I found that, like I said, one of the big things I had a problem with was that I felt that Kaladin had taken the easy route when he needed to take the hard route. I was really looking for a good plot cycle. I needed something to pull this book together. I had characters but I didn't have a plot and I've mentioned before that sometimes things come [to me] in different orders. In this book world and character came to me, in fact character came to me first, world came second and then I was building the plot around it. I knew the plot of the entire epic and the entire series but I needed a much stronger plot for book one. Because of the various things that are happening I wanted to deal with a war.

So I was planning a war away from Alethkar, and I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do with this war. Meanwhile I have Inkthinker, Ben McSweeney, doing concept art for me to use in my pitch to Tom Doherty at Tor and he says, "Hey, I just drew up this sketch of some creature that lives at the bottom of a chasm, what do you think?" And he showed me this.

I told him that we were looking for kind of above water coral reef formations, and he sends me this brain coral, which is essentially the Shattered Plains with a big monster living at the bottom and I'm like, "Wow!" I actually did a book where this was essentially the setting. I looked at that, and that's actually what made me say, "Wait a minute, could I transpose this and would the Shattered Plains actually make more sense on Roshar than they ever did on Yolen?" I started playing with that concept and I absolutely fell in love with the idea. Unfortunately for
*Dragonsteel*
, that was the only really good plot cycle from that book.

[You can read Ben's take on this story here. That's also where we got the images, which we've used with permission. —ed]

So, I ripped it out of that book and I put it here, and that means it brought with it a few side characters who no longer live on Yolen because they now live on Roshar. Rock is one of them, though he's been changed. When he came along the Horneaters were born; they had not been in the books before. For those who have read
*Dragonsteel*
, he was Ke'Chan [a nationality, not a name. —ed] in that book. I couldn't bring that culture because that culture is extremely vital to [
*Dragonsteel*
]. I can bring a plot cycle or a little region, and there's certain things you can pull out of a book without ruining the soul of what the book is. I couldn't take the Ke'Chan out of
*Dragonsteel*
; they're just part of what that book is and so Rock had to change nationalities. I had to build him his own nationality, a new culture essentially just for him. And yeah, it worked wonderfully.

Someday I'll let you have that art, and if you remind me to ask Peter you can probably post it with the interview. As you can just see it's not the way that it ended up being because it looks different from how the Shattered Plains turned out, but it was the spark that made me say, "Let's move this over."

#### 17TH SHARD

That's cool, so basically Inkthinker's responsible for the Shattered Plains?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Inkthinker is responsible for them moving to the new book, yes.

#### 17TH SHARD

That's pretty cool.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah.
