# [Interview #692: 17th Shard Interview, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=692#1)

#### 17th Shard

Hey everyone, welcome to 17th Shard's exclusive interview with Brandon Sanderson. In attendance from 17th Shard are Eric, Josh and Mi'ch. This interview is mostly spoiler free, but at the end there are some Mistborn questions that do contain spoilers. We'll warn you before we get to that point. That notwithstanding, we'll mostly ask general stuff about
*The Way of Kings*
. We're all very exited for this so lets get right to it.
