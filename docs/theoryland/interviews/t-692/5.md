#### 17th Shard

On later Stormlight Archive novels will there always be one character we get to see flashbacks for?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, and it should rotate to different characters. I have not yet decided who gets book two yet. It's really between Dalinar and Shallan and I go back and forth on whose story I want to tell next.

#### 17TH SHARD

So, does that mean there's going to be 10 different characters that would be seen?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It's very likely there will be 10 different characters. The only caveat on that is that part of me really wants to do a second Kaladin book. And so I haven't quite decided who gets flashback books. You can probably guess from reading this book some of them who do. But there are some that don't necessarily absolutely need them, so Kaladin may get a second flashback book.

#### 17TH SHARD

So, fingers crossed, fingers crosses, will Szeth get one?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Szeth will get a book.

#### 17TH SHARD

YES! (laughter) We're all cheering.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, Szeth will get a book. Shallan and Dalinar will get books.

#### 17TH SHARD

Adolin?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Umâ€¦I'm not sure on him yet. He's one that could, maybe not. I mean he's got some interesting things going on but we'll see how the series progresses first. There are characters who will get flashback books that you haven't yet met or at least not spent much time with.
