#### 17th Shard

Okay, next question. How is
*The Way of Kings*
related to the rest of the cosmere? What point in time is it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, so far I have written the books/series chronologically. Though, I have skipped books...

#### 17TH SHARD

(laughter)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

And so there will be jumping back eventually, but
*Elantris*
, Mistborn,
*Warbreaker*
and
*Way of Kings*
all happened chronologically.

#### 17TH SHARD

Just in general, how is it related to the rest of the cosmere? Or can you say?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I, uh...officially don't know what you're talking about.

#### 17TH SHARD

(laughter)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I mean, what do you mean by "related to"?

#### 17TH SHARD

For example, the letter...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, just like the letter that I have no idea what you're talking about.
