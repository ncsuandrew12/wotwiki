#### 17th Shard

What can you tell us about the Knights Radiant?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Umâ€¦what can I tell you that's not in the books?

#### 17TH SHARD

A little more about them.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

There were 10 orders of Knights Radiant. Each order was based on a combination of two of the "smaller" magic systems in this world, so to speak. You combine two of them together and they each had something kind of "their own". So if you look at the map in the front of the magic system and you mark circles that include one large circle and two of the smaller circles in between, you can find the 10 orders right on there. The mini circles are the powers and the big circles represent the orders and the essences and things like that. So one big circle, two little circles equals an order of Knights Radiant.
