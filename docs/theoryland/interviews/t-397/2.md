# [Interview #397: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Signing + Mistborn Audible, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=397#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The work proceeds nicely. The Wheel of Time book is interesting in that I've got a LOT of different types of feedback on it. There's Harriet, of course, but also Mr. Jordan's two assistants, Maria and Alan. They are continuity experts, and have been going through the pages I've done and have been fact checking and giving feedback on general issues as well. I had worried that having three editors on this project would make it more difficult to work on, but so far it's simply been a big help. There is SO much going on in this book and this world that having the extra sets of eyes is very helpful.
