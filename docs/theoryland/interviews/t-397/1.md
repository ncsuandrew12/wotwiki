# [Interview #397: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Signing + Mistborn Audible, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=397#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll be doing a signing tonight at 7:30 at the Barnes and Noble at the Jordan Commons (EDIT: I mean JORDAN LANDING There's no bookstore at the Commons) in West Jordan Utah. If you live in the area, drop by! I'll happily sign books and chat.

Also, it looks like
[Mistborn book one is finally up on audible](http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/enSearch/searchResults.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&N=0&Ntx=mode%2Bmatchallpartial&D=mistborn&Dx=mode%2Bmatchallpartial&Ntk=S_Keywords&Ntt=mistborn&x=0&y=0)
. You should be able to find the audio edition other locations as well. Huzzah! Now just one more to go and the entire trilogy will be on audio.

from readers. The second one being the scene that I mentioned in annotations I'd like to see. We really need to get my fanart section up and running. I'll go poke Sprig (aka Jordo, aka my webmaster) on that one.
