# [Interview #814: Other Tidbits From Brandon Sanderson's SDCC Spotlight, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=814#7)

#### Question

Which authors does Brandon currently love to read?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I read a lot of Terry Pratchett. He's a legitimate genius and the books are different enough that I don't have to worry about any unconscious influence on my own writing. Guy Gavriel Kay is the best writer of fantasy today. I frequently read Robin Hobb novels. I love Vernor Vinge."
