# [Interview #814: Other Tidbits From Brandon Sanderson's SDCC Spotlight, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=814#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

About the Mistborn movie:

Brandon conveyed that six drafts of the movie script have been done and that the latest draft, which he really likes, focuses more on the relationship between Vin and her brother Reen as a counterpart to Vin's relationship with Kelsier. Brandon and the independent producers are still shopping the script around to movie studios, however.
