# [Interview #814, Entry #2]: Other Tidbits From Brandon Sanderson's SDCC Spotlight](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=814#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

About The Wheel of Time:

Brandon delivered a little preamble/update on the progress of the book before reading the portion of Chapter One. "We are on time. Well, okay, we're late but we're on time enough that we're going to hit the January 8th [release date]."

He went on to explain, "We know you were hoping we could push it up to a November release, but we need the extra time to make sure we get this right. [Unlike
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
] we don't get another chance at this. This is the last book."

Further, Brandon mentioned that he had been up until 5 AM revising the novel, but added that he kind of likes to do that impulsively anyhow.
