## [Entry #1](./t-655/1)

#### Scot T. May

I didn't get a chance to see
[Pam's T-shirt](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=33#4)
. :( I did see John's marching circuits shirt.

And, Pam did kinda blend in, dressed in black, although there was more black leather than anything else in that neighborhood. I felt out of place in my Snoopy t-shirt and IBM haircut.

Parking wasn't too bad. I parked a couple of blocks west of the book shop and it wasn't even metered. I suppose it must be worse on weekdays.

It was good pizza at Giordano's. Much better than around here at Purdue.

## [Entry #2](./t-655/2)

#### Robert Jordan

Interesting enough, Jordan had three bottles of Perrier and some cheese to munch on for the time he was there. And Jordan was pretty nice, though he had an intense stare. I was surprised that he wasn't cranky after all these trips. I've only gone to one other book signing, and the author there was cranky. He didn't have any cheese, though.

## [Entry #3](./t-655/3)

#### Scot T. May

I only got a chance to ask one question.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan was in Vietnam from '68-'70, apparently.

## [Entry #4](./t-655/4)

#### Scot T. May

Does that particular Tor representative go to every signing, or is he local? He must have been from out of town, I think, as he wasn't in black leather.

Later,
  
Scot
