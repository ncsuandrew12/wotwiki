#### leiftinspace

I've picked up in bits in pieces that it's possible, for some people at least, to use the Shardpools to worldhop...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### leiftinspace

Can non-invested people do that, or do you have to have some form of investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### leiftinspace

Do you have to have any special investiture above and beyond the normal spark of life?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm gonna go ahead and RAFO that.
