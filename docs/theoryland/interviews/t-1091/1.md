# [Interview #1091: Idaho Falls Signing Report - leiftinspace, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1091#1)

#### leiftinspace

Can you tell me how long it was from the Sshattering of Adonalsium to the prelude of
*The Way of Kings*
when the Heralds abandoned the Oathpact?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Current timeline, which I have NOT canonized, is around 6,000 years... I have not finished with my outline document yet.

#### leiftinspace

'Cause I've looked at the current chronology and it's very, very spotty...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes it is... the real trick is... making sure that I fit in, for instance,
*White Sand*
and things with the proper amount... because I haven't released that book series yet, I have to make sure while we're doing the graphic novel, that it fits the chronology, which is why I can't quite canonize things yet.

#### leiftinspace

That one takes place before
*The Way of Kings*
doesn't it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### leiftinspace

'Cause I know one of the worldhoppers from there shows up in
*The Way of Kings*
...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah,
*White Sand*
is one of the very earliest.
