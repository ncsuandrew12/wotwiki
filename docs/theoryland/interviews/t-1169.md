## [Entry #1](./t-1169/1)

#### Question

Are the similarities of Dalinar's last vision and Shallan's flashback experience of Middlefest, significant?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

## [Entry #2](./t-1169/2)

#### Question

Zahel calls Renarin "the son of the most powerful human on thisâ€”" Does that refer to Dalinar or to his wife?
A:

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dalinar

#### Question

How would he have ended that sentence?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"...planet"

## [Entry #3](./t-1169/3)

#### Question

Which eye does the Sovereign have spiked? And what does the spike give?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The opposite eye that Marsh has spiked. And nothing special. More to come in Secret History 2 and 3.

## [Entry #4](./t-1169/4)

#### Question

How did Marsh become regarded as Death in Elendel Basin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Only because he looks scary and has been present at ominous times.

## [Entry #5](./t-1169/5)

#### Question

Has Bloody Tan seen the Sovereign?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #6](./t-1169/6)

#### Question

will Stick make another appearance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

it's really unlikely

## [Entry #7](./t-1169/7)

#### Question

When
is dying, his Breath flares up and does weird stuff, and Vasher says that's really rare. What exactly is going on here?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO card

## [Entry #8](./t-1169/8)

#### Question

Do Vasher and Vivenna hook up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Definite RAFO

## [Entry #9](./t-1169/9)

#### Question

Siri mentions that Bluefinger's ability to keep track of time seems almost supernatural- is it supernatural?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Good Question.

## [Entry #10](./t-1169/10)

#### Question

Can a Returned give their Divine Breath to someone else like how a regular Nathian would give their Breath away? Ie: would that then make the recipient "Divine" or elevate them to the 5th heightening?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They can give their Divine Breath away but it wouldn't make the recipient divine or anything. Basically, this is how they heal someone- by using the "My life to yours, my Breath become yours" command.

## [Entry #11](./t-1169/11)

#### Question

In the written novel of Warbreaker there is a scene where Vasher uses a special command to put all of his Breath into a rope except for his Divine Breath, but it doesn't say what command he uses. In the same scene in the Graphic Audio version, Vasher says, "My Breath to give, for life to live." Is that command canon or was that a construct of the Graphic Audio team?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd have to check with Peter and/or Isaac, but I \*think\* it is canon. Basically you can treat is as being canon for now.

## [Entry #12](./t-1169/12)

#### Question

Who painted the paintings that Lightsong reacted to? Anyone specific?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is one painting that was painted by someone significant- someone you've heard of. Any more than that is RAFO.

## [Entry #13](./t-1169/13)

#### Question

Has Hoid ever submitted a painting to the Court of Gods?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is the sort of thing that Hoid would do, but none of the paintings that we've seen were by Hoid or anything.

## [Entry #14](./t-1169/14)

#### Question

Could Bloody Tan burn bendalloy (because it mentions he steals a large shipment of bendalloy)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*cautiously\* ...which version of Bloody Tan? (If you've read Shadows of Self, then you know why Brandon was hesitant here)

#### Question

The "Alloy of Law" version, not later.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he didn't burn Bendalloy to pull the stunt with Lessie and the bullet or anything. He stole the bendalloy because its expensive and valuable.

## [Entry #15](./t-1169/15)

#### Question

Does Paalm make any cameos in the first Mistborn Trilogy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO

## [Entry #16](./t-1169/16)

#### Question

What does the flute do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

it plays music.

#### Question

\*laughs nervously\* but there must be more to it

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*smiles\* all the flute does is play music. (He said more, but I can't really remember well enough to write down)

## [Entry #17](./t-1169/17)

#### Question

During this same scene, Hoid mentions that he'd been named after a rock, a very beautiful one. Was this a reference to Dragonsteel? When he had the name Topaz?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes

## [Entry #18](./t-1169/18)

#### Question

Stone is sacred to the Shin. Do Oathstones have anything to do with that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Oathstones have a lot to do with their religion.

## [Entry #19](./t-1169/19)

#### Question

It is mentioned that Lift went to the Old Magic. What did she get? Do you know what she got?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is mentioned in Edgedancer.
