# [Interview #248: KOD Signing Report - Sodas, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=248#2)

#### Robert Jordan

While we waited in line, we could see Jordan signing books inside, but Jordan looked extremely tired. At one point when we finally made it inside the bookstore, he mentioned that the line just seemed to get bigger, not smaller. One thing that was very noticeable was that he was very somber, and didn't really crack many jokes (he didn't offer to punch anyone for mentioning Asmodean for instance).
