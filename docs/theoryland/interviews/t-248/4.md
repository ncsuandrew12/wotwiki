# [Interview #248: KOD Signing Report - Sodas, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=248#4)

#### Sodas

Can you please expand upon what Mazrim Taim was up to in Andor prior to meeting Rand for the first time?

#### Robert Jordan

At that point, Jordan stopped writing. Not looking up, he donned a very visible smirk that was in great contast to the very somber look he had the whole evening. His answer was a very crisp "No."

#### Sodas

Thanking him, I decided to exit the bookstore. Due to the size of the bookstore, they would not let people back inside. So instead of waiting another hour for a doubtful few more questions, we decided that his answer was sufficient to know exactly what we wanted.

If you want my opinion, his look convinced me that Taim killed Asmodean. It was
*that*
startling.
