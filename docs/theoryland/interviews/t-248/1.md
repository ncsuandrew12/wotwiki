# [Interview #248, Entry #1]: KOD Signing Report - Sodas](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=248#1)

#### Sodas

Well, the San Diego Signing went very smoothly. There were about 200 people there, all trying to cram into a small bookstore. Jordan looked very fit, but seemed tired. There was no Q&A session, and the store announced that they would be giving out numbers only to people who purchased books at the store that evening. Having already purchased mine, when the crowd moved outside, I was just behind all the numbered people (140 or so). The bookstore people rushed us through VERY quickly, as some people were saying Jordan had an early flight out in the morning.
