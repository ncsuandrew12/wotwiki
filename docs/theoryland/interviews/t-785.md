## Entry #1

#### aurik

I was at Dallas as well, and was able to ask the following two questions while he signed:

## Entry #2

#### aurik

What was the most jaw-dropping scene (or scenes) to you when you read the material for
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verin.

#### aurik

That's what you answered for Book 12. I'm asking about Book 13, which I've already read.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Everyone in line close your ears. The whole Tower of Ghenjei sequence. That was all written by Jim. Also, the surprise proposal at the end.

## Entry #3

#### aurik

Are they using the trick with the thirteen Myrdraal and thirteen channelers to create new Dreadlords?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### aurik

But I've already read Book 13; that's why I'm asking.

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO after
*A Memory of Light*
.
