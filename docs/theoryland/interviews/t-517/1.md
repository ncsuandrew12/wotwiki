# [Interview #517, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Last chance to vote for the David Gemmell Legend Award](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=517#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've mentioned a few times that both
*Warbreaker*
and
*The Gathering Storm*
are among five nominees for the
[David Gemmell Legend Award](http://gemmellaward.com/page/vote-for-the-legend-here)
. Well, voting on the award ends on Monday May 31st. Since the award is based in the UK, I assume the voting closes at midnight UK time, which is 5:00 or maybe 6:00 p.m. Mountain time (depending on whether daylight saving time is taken into account).
If you're struggling to pick between the two books, I recommend
*The Gathering Storm*
since I feel it's more in the spirit of Mr. Gemmell's work. Plus, you know, Robert Jordan collected weapons, and I think an award that's a battleaxe would be right up his alley.
[So go vote!](http://gemmellaward.com/page/vote-for-the-legend-here)
(Assuming you want either book to win.)
