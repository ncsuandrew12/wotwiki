This is a collection of tweets mostly from PRK about answers Brandon gave at SwanCon in Perth. PRK was
[too busy running the con](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188587103758729216)
to write up a report.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (4 April 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/187467350050750465)

Walked along the water in Perth today. I was not attacked by a single snake, spider, or shark. Australia, you're letting me down.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/187470414950318080)

Also, PRK from #swancon did indeed warn me about drop-bears. I will be sure to wear vegemite behind my ears to protect myself.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/187552982408232960)

Had a very lovely dinner at Bonsai with @BrandSanderson and @mdepierres—they're fantastic guests! #Swancon is going to be awesome.

Got RAFO'd on asking where the wind blows from in
*A Memory of Light*
.

Demandred will have some awesome stuff in
*A Memory of Light*
.

In
*The Gathering Storm*
, Egwene was mostly RJ, Rand mostly Brandon. In
*Towers of Midnight*
, Mat mostly RJ, Perrin mostly Brandon.

## [Entry #6](./t-739/6)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### [PRK (7 APRIL 2012)](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188525595817279488)

Brandon tried to get moments for every character in
*A Memory of Light*
. Egwene is ready to be bad ass in the Last Battle; her character development is done.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188539199681593345)

Perth Exclusive for #WoT counted scenes by viewpoint. Rand has the most viewpoints in
*A Memory of Light*
, not a huge margin. Others tied.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188539428346667009)

Caveat, still revising
*A Memory of Light*
, so that can change.

#### [LISA-MAREE BARBA](https://twitter.com/Minaeveiendha/status/188547277810434048)

It's not much but Brandon S just told me that Lan has the most POVs in
*A Memory of Light*
, only just ahead of Rand. But that could change with editing.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188551816991084544)

I thought he said Rand ahead of the other main characters?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188567454895702017)

That doesn't even make sense. :s Sure, Lan is vital, but it's hard to see how the story could focus on him that much.

#### [PRK (8 APRIL)](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/189188554004500483)

Confirmed it was Rand with the highest number of POV scenes in
*A Memory of Light*
(at the moment).

#### Footnote

It might be that Brandon said Rand was first just ahead of Lan, and Lisa-Maree mixed them up, but it seems somewhat unlikely.

## [Entry #7](./t-739/7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### [PRK (7 APRIL 2012)](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188536009745629185)

The Padan Fain / Mordeth hybrid will be in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188536612249010176)

Got a RAFO on how the Mordeth/Fain Hybrid influences the Black Wind.

## [Entry #8](./t-739/8)

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### [PRK (7 APRIL 2012)](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188537828404248576)

Nakomi thing is a huge RAFO.

## [Entry #9](./t-739/9)

#### [Terez (7 April 2012)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188591273840615426)

Ask him if there is a Waygate anywhere near Lugard. We suspect that Ogier-built Shaemal was somewhere in Murandy.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188595628635459586)

Why does it matter where Shaemal is?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188596257328074752)

It only matters because of the possibility of a Waygate in Murandy, which is why I phrased the question the way I did.

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188596311560429568)

It has to do with the theory that Roedran is Demandred. ;)

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188596585523970048)

Okay, I'll ask that one next time!

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### [PRK (8 APRIL)](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188894886936838144)

Answer re Lugard Waygate: "\*chuckles\* That's clever! Anything I say will give away too much, so I'll have to RAFO that one."

## [Entry #10](./t-739/10)

#### [Terez (8 April 2012)](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188985694365032448)

Ask him if the manner of the Aiel service to the Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends was just Singing, or if it was also domestic.

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188988724607074305)

As a follow-up you could ask him if female Voices were also used in non-Earthy scenarios, i.e. to enhance
*saidar*
in particular?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188994993569005568)

And ask him if non-Aiel could really have the Voice (assuming the type that enhances channeling) or if Lews Therin was just confused.

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/189187565272838145)

Lews Therin was confused about time and place, but what he was saying was possible.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/189187913773359107)

There was more than just singing, but Brandon wasn't willing to go into it. Unsure if that was RAFO or irrelevance.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/189188286244331523)

Brandon said he wasn't willing to talk much about the Voice things. I got the sense it was a subtle RAFO.

Even the salt & pepper shakers at #Swancon are themed!

Convinced @BrandSanderson to try the Kangaroo—not sure if he liked it or was being polite. #WeEatOurNationalFauna #Australia
