In the most recent Writing Excuses podcast episode, Mary Robinette Kowal, Howard Tayler, Dan Wells, and I talk about
[breaking the rules](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2013/02/03/)
. We've said that you've got to learn the rules before you break them, so now it's time to talk about why to break them.
