## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sorry for the long time between updates! Touring always leaves me beat. So this post is probably going to be kind of long as I cover all of the things that need to be posted here.

First off,
[*Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones*](http://www.amazon.com/Alcatraz-Versus-Scriveners-Bones/dp/0439925533/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225916428&sr=8-1)
is now officially out! It's a tad hard to find, as most bookstores only got one or two copies, but it's out there. If you are a fan of fast paced, humorous adventure fiction, please consider picking up a copy! Really, I think you'll find yourself surprised by how much you enjoy the
*Alcatraz*
books. A lot of my epic fantasy readers are hesitant, but there's a lot more going on in these than the covers and/or genre may imply.

Anyway, if you are thinking of getting a copy, might I suggest
[contacting the bookstore Mysterious Galaxy](http://www.mystgalaxy.com/)
? I know they have plenty of copies, and I believe they have some signed first editions they are selling for cover price. They're a great store and will be happy to ship you copies of both
*Alcatraz*
books. (I suggest calling before ordering to make sure you get a signed copy.)

Next,
*Elantris*
is finally out on Audiobook! You can find it at
[Audible](http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V5CMZ8)
, Amazon, or the
[publisher's website](http://www.recordedbooks.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=rb.show_prod&book_id=79412&prod_id=DF050)
. We've been waiting for a long time to get one of my epic fantasy books out on audio, and I know a lot of you have asked about it, so here you go! (And the cover is pretty cool, I must say.)

Third, I'll be signing in the Seattle area the next three days. If you live over in that direction, consider stopping by to see me! We'll have books to sign and I should be doing a reading at several of the signings. (I know I'll be doing one at the University Bookstore.) Most of my readings have been from
*Mistborn: The Hero of Ages*
, though sometimes I dip into other projects. (I can't read from
*A Memory of Light*
, though—unless it's the first few lines of chapter one, which are always the same . . . )

## Entry #2

And, speaking of
*A Memory of Light*
, I've updated the book by another percentage point, and it looks like it's time to look at our comparison chart of lengths again.
