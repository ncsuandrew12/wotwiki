## Entry #1

#### Fire Arcadia

I met Brandon today in York, UK. You will soon be able to see a picture on twitter of the cookie I have him. Since I knew it was thanksgiving, it was a thanksgiving-themed cookie.

After getting books signed, I asked him a few questions, listed below as best I can remember them.

## Entry #2

#### Fire Arcadia

Are there 50 Allomantic Metals?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nearly. Does Harmony have a metal?

#### FIRE ARCADIA

Is that an alloy of Lerasium and Atium?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You're along the right lines.

## Entry #3

#### Fire Arcadia

What is the definition of Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. Investiture is off the table as far as questions go.

## Entry #4

#### Fire Arcadia

You have said before that all the planets had their names before the arrival of the Shards. Is Roshar the planet's name before the Shards arrived?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

How do the Roshar natives know the name of the Cosmere?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

RAFO

## Entry #5

#### Fire Arcadia

Is Shallan's memory a Surge?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I want to wait for the right opportunity before revealing more surges.

## Entry #6

#### Fire Arcadia

You have said previously that the Stormlight Archive will include Lightweaving. Is that still the plan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

Have we seen a Roshar native in
*The Way of Kings*
who can use Lightweaving?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, we have seen someone who has potential.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

He seemed to be trying to say that they didn't know that they can use it.

## Entry #7

#### Fire Arcadia

How many Heralds appear in
*The Way of Kings*

#### Brandon Sanderson

More than you might expect. Some have appeared, some have been mentioned but not appeared.

#### Footnote

One of these Heralds that appeared is Shalash.

## Entry #8

#### Fire Arcadia

Can you tell me something about the Cosmere that you haven't told anyone before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are inhabited planets in the cosmere that don't have any Shards there. There may be inhabited planets that only have a Splinter of a Shard. There are 10 core cosmere planets, which tell the overarching story of the cosmere.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

Are all the Cosmere books so far set on these 10 core worlds?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes.

#### FIRE ARCADIA

Are there any of the 10 core worlds without a Shard?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

All 10 core worlds have significant Shardic influence.
