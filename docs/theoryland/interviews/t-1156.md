## [Entry #1](./t-1156/1)

#### Question

The person in front of me asked if Brandon invents ridiculous accents for Wayne just to see if Michael Kramer can do different voices.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it's not just to torture Michael, though Brandon really enjoys hearing how Michael reads the different voices and he's amazed at the various accents, and he listens to all of the audiobooks at least once...
However, Brandon will say he has one voice planned for Wayne that does make him giggle when he thinks of Michael Kramer having to do it. He's going to LAFO (Listen and Find Out) which voice it is, but we'll all likely be rolling around in tears when it happens.

## [Entry #2](./t-1156/2)

#### Cadmium

"Would it actually be possible for a Kandra to "become a rusting bunny?" Also, Thanks for Wayne. He's my favorite character.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, But it would be Tough. They must keep a certain mass to maintain intelligence and a bunny is very small.

#### Cadmium

But obviously being a Harvey sized bunny is totally doable.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah... Good movie reference.

## [Entry #3](./t-1156/3)

#### Cadmium

Would a Connection medallion work for sign language?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Cadmium

Would it make the person’s fingers move or would spoken word be interpreted mentally as the appropriate sign? Would it overcome deafness?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(a non committal “ehhh noise”) It would translate the communication. I can say that.

## [Entry #4](./t-1156/4)

#### Cadmium

Does a Connection medallion account for heavy sarcasm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would. Maybe not the heaviest, most deadpan sarcasm.

## [Entry #5](./t-1156/5)

#### Cadmium

Would a Connection medallion accurately interpret a Listener’s Rhythms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it would, but not all of it, some would be lost in translation. You’d probably lose some of the nuance. It would probably be better to give the medallion to someone who couldn't understand it than someone who spoke it.

## [Entry #6](./t-1156/6)

#### Cadmium

Who cut Lopen’s food for him while he was one-handed?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs) Well, I’d have to say he doesn’t need anyone to cut his food for him, he’d just kind of grr, arrgh (pantomimes, stabbing something on table with fork and ripping into it with teeth) Because he’s The Lopen right, and he can take care of his food himself. Great question. Very unique.

## [Entry #7](./t-1156/7)

#### Cadmium

You’re in Houston, questions of Oil & Gas and energy sources will be naturally be bandied about.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Naturally.

#### Cadmium

Is the gasoline on Scadrial a fossil fuel or biodiesel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh. Hmm. Well It’s fossil fue… no. What they’re using now is mostly biodiesel, I think. It’s not something we really talked out.

#### Cadmium

Ok, we had a whole thread on 17th Shard and even discussed how scientifically fossil fuels could have been put into place during the Catacendre.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, fossil fuels are possible, and I don’t want to seem like I’m clearly giving credence to those that believe in a Young Earth, but Scadrial \*is\* a relatively young planet. Relatively.

#### Cadmium

Young Earth doesn’t bother me, though I know I’m not the majority. Where on Scadrial is it being produced? No mention of refineries in Elendel or the Roughs.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Where on Scadrial… Well It’s… I’m going to have to RAFO that for now. It starts to touch on questions of the future as they will need more fuels for travel and they’ll need to look for different sources.
We’ll just leave it at “If fossil fuels are there, they were placed intentionally.”

#### Cadmium

Okay. I just didn't see any mention of oil derricks in the Roughs or fuel producing infrastructure in Elendel. I’ll just continue to hold out hope that we see Wax fighting some big battle all around an oil derrick.
(I start eyeballing the last question on my notepad trying to decide if I'm going to push it.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ok, well, I need to move on, but thank you, those were really great questions. Good to see you again.
