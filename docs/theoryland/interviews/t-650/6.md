# [Interview #650: COT Signing Report - Sonne, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=650#6)

#### Sonne

RJ also gave me some career advice. Careful not to offend him or imply that his wife is not an adequate editor, I asked if he had any advice for me, a wannabe Assistant Editor.

#### Robert Jordan

The Creator himself merely chuckled and admitted that he mostly tries avoiding New York City and those types, as he hates attending cocktail parties and other dreary social functions! However, he then encouraged me to keep writing, and submit manuscripts. He was pretty adamant about that.
