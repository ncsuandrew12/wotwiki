# [Interview #650: COT Signing Report - Sonne, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=650#1)

#### Sonne

As I navigated my car into a vacant space on the far end of the parking lot of the Chester County Book & Music Company, I noticed a black stretch limo outside of the bookstore. It would be there all night, and it was Robert Jordan’s ride. Immediately, I figured that this man might be a jerk. I’d heard stories and disappointments.

I soon learned that Robert Jordan is a completely reasonable and down to earth person.

#### Robert Jordan

He explained his basic rules of book signing, answered a few FAQs, and took a generous amount of time to take pictures with every person and answer every question. While I waited for my queue number to be called, I stood near the side of the table where the author sat and listened to questions asked by other fans, and Jordan’s answers. Naturally, he gave a few RAFOs (read and find outs), but he discussed and announced some very interesting and key points about his work.
