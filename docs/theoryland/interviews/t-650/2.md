#### Robert Jordan

Firstly, Robert Jordan announced that someone on the internet had used the evidence heâ€™d presented to determine who killed Asmodean. He would not say who got it right, or on what site he found it, or who the killer is. However, this proves that Jordan obviously cares at least somewhat about what we actually think about his work and what we can deduce from it, though as an experienced writer, he will do what he wishes in his own story and with his own characters.
