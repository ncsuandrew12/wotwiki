# [Interview #650: COT Signing Report - Sonne, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=650#5)

#### Robert Jordan

The author suggested setting a daily goal. He said that even if you only write one page per day, you will have 365 pages in one year, and that could be a novel. (I was quick to realize that 365 pages by Robert Jordan, however, would hardly qualify as more than a teaser!)
