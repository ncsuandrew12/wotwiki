#### Matoyak

Have the visions and other such prophecies about Egwene and the Seanchan (such as the running one and the one with the sword) have they been fulfilled yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, none of those have been fulfilled other than the attack on the White Tower. She still has more to go.
