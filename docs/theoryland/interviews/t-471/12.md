# [Interview #471: TGS Signing Report - Matoyak, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=471#12)

#### Random Storm Leader

[note from Mato: had some trouble hearing this next question, take its answer as just a generic "RAFO, not a typo. There were other typos. < insert example >"]

Was Sulin really with Rand orâ€”?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. I will tell you when there are typos or not. This is a RAFO.
Some typos that have been found are Bashere appearing as Faile's cousin rather than uncle...my hands kept wanting to type cousin instead.

#### Random Storm Leader

Ah, what about the Amyrlin stole versus shawl?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Typo. My hands kept trying to switch stole and shawl throughout the book. Giving me trouble. You know how it is when you're going along and your hands want to type something different...
