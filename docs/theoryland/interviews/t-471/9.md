# [Interview #471, Entry #9]: TGS Signing Report - Matoyak](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=471#9)

#### Matoyak

Did the meeting between Rand and Moridin for sure happen in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
or could it have happened in a vacuole?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I...well. I'm going to partially RAFO this. I will not say it for sure happened in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, and I'm not sure whether the other instances of this were
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
either.

#### Footnote

The referenced meeting between Rand and Moridin occurred in
*The Gathering Storm*
15, and Brandon later
[clarified](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#24)
that this meeting took place in Moridin's dream.
