# [Interview #471: TGS Signing Report - Matoyak, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=471#7)

#### Roga

Does Elayne know that Alanna bonded Rand?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh...well...I'll have to check that. MAFO. Good question.

From
*Winter’s Heart*
, chapter 12, Rand speaking to Elayne, Aviendha, and Min: “Anyway, Alanna Mosvani got there ahead of you, and she didn’t bother asking . . . I’ve been bonded to her for months now.”

#### Footnote—Terez

I asked around about this because I believed that Mato had misheard the name, and that the question was actually about whether Egwene knew about the bonding. (Many people pronounce it egg-WEEN instead of the proper egg-WAIN, so it's easy for those people to hear 'Elayne' when 'Egwene' is pronounced correctly.) The question was asked by Roga, a Stormleader, and he clarified:

If this question came from the Dallas signing, then it was from me. I asked about Egwene.

The reason behind the question was, I wanted to know: if Alanna's name had been on Verin's list in
*The Gathering Storm*
, would Egwene have passed over it? However, Brandon pointed out that Verin knew about the bond, so unless she had some reason to keep quiet, I'd think she should've made some kind of special warning note if Alanna had been in her list.

Egwene did not know.
