# [Interview #471: TGS Signing Report - Matoyak, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=471#13)

#### Matoyak

Well there ya have it! Lots of good information here, the death of a faction war being among one of them. Also, I have official proof that Bela killed Asmodean.

For the personalization of my signing I put:

For Mason Matoyak \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ killed Asmodean.

Here's the pic of what he wrote: [Brandon filled in the blank with 'Bela'.]
