# [Interview #515, Entry #8]: JordanCon: Interview with Alan Romanczuk by Richard Fife](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=515#8)

#### Richard Fife

Brandon has often said there is a "Big Thing" everyone has missed in books four through six. I know this is typically RAFO'd, but is there any hint at all you give us? (At this point the room we were in grows quiet and several people cock their heads, listening.)

#### Alan Romanczuk

No.
