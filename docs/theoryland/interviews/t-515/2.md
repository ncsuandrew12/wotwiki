# [Interview #515: JordanCon: Interview with Alan Romanczuk by Richard Fife, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=515#2)

#### Richard Fife

When did you first meet Jim, and when did you get involved with The Wheel of Time?

#### Alan Romanczuk

In 2001, I was hired on recommendation of Maria Simons, who had worked for Jim for years at that point. I had known Maria through our children going to the same school. Maria's work had gotten to the point where she couldn't keep doing the research for Jim—the continuity work, looking up obscure facts—because of all her other responsibilities. So, I was brought on to pretty much take on that aspect of what Maria had been doing.

I met Jim the day I came in. He was sitting at his desk and stood up, and we had a nice little chat about pipe smoking and fantasy, a little bit of this and that, and I then went upstairs to my little burrow in the back of the carriage house, where I've remained for many years.
