# [Interview #515: JordanCon: Interview with Alan Romanczuk by Richard Fife, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=515#1)

#### Richard Fife

Alan Romanczuk can be called many things. He is the "Time Lord" of The Wheel of Time, keeping dates and “who was where when” straight in the notes, and he is also a man with whom I can have long, wonderful conversations about computers and technology. He was the first to find out about the
