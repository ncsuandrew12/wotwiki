# [Interview #515: JordanCon: Interview with Alan Romanczuk by Richard Fife, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=515#3)

#### Richard Fife

Do you have a particularly favorite scene in the books?

#### Alan Romanczuk

My favorite scene is in the fourteenth book. About two-thirds of the way through, there is this fantastic scene . . . .

#### Richard Fife

I'm afraid I haven't read that one yet.

#### Alan Romanczuk

Well, the Last Battle will knock you dead. It will be great.

#### Richard Fife

They do say it will break the world.

#### Alan Romanczuk

Or the bank, whichever comes first.

#### Richard Fife

So, in the published books?

#### Alan Romanczuk

The published books? Ah. I don't have a specifically favorite scene, but in the recent books that Jim had written, the one that comes to mind for me is when Perrin was at his wit's end trying to find his wife and get information on Faile, and he goes to interrogate the captured Shaido they have staked out on the ground. Against all expectations, he chops off the man's limb, and makes it very clear to him that he is not going to kill him, but makes sure he is crippled for the rest of his life and will have to depend on others for his well being.

What is striking about that is not only the surprise in what happened to Perrin's personality, but the fact that we see the depths of this man who had been operating at an almost emotionless state, or at least with a single, fixed purpose, which was saving his wife. We see him, the peace-loving blacksmith who, just through fate, is thrown into a position of leadership, suddenly do something that is completely out of character, or that we think is out of character, when in fact it is springing from his depths, something that needs to be done. So, in that scene, we see an inkling of Perrin becoming the person that he needs to be to take part in the Last Battle.
