# [Interview #515: JordanCon: Interview with Alan Romanczuk by Richard Fife, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=515#5)

#### Richard Fife

So now you are working with Brandon. What is that like?

#### Alan Romanczuk

Brandon's a lot of fun. I am really amazed at the way he can create new worlds in his own right. He might not have the worldly experience that Jim did, being much younger. He never went through war as Jim had. He didn't grow up in the South as Jim had. Yet he has been able to jump into this world and pick up where he needs to pick up and go with it. He has a really fresh mind, a lively mind. I see in Brandon his really childlike grasp of fantasy, which is wonderful. And I don't mean childish, I mean childlike, with just an awe and just a total delight in forming new devices and plot twists and new types of characters and scenes. Yeah, it is a lot of fun. He is going to be a well-known author, if he is not already.
