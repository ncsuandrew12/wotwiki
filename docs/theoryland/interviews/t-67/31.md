#### Rog in CT

Rand recovered very quickly from his dual Healing. Is this because of the way men Heal or because of the Warder bond or both?

#### Robert Jordan

Partly the Warder bond and partly the kind of Healing that was used on him. It should be obvious that Damer Flinn has discovered the same method of Healing that Nynaeve uses and of course, he still is not completely Healed, remember.
