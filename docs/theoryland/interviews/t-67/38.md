#### BHeins1

I was just wondering if you have read the FAQ compiled by many of your fans. If so, how would you evaluate its accuracy?

#### Robert Jordan

It's been about a year since someone's sent me a copy of the FAQ. At that time, the proportions were running pretty much the same as the early ones I'd seen: about a third are right, a third are almost right, and the rest are blue sky. In fact, there have been some arguments over things I'd thought I'd made clear. (Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? Bela knows!)
