#### SCLaCore

Which of the books is he most satisfied with?

#### Robert Jordan

I couldn't really say. I try to make each book better than the preceding book and frankly, once I have written a book, I stop thinking about it. My mind is focused on the next book, to the extent, actually, that when I came back from turning in
*A Crown of Swords*
, though I intended to take a short vacation, I found myself sitting at the computer and working on the next book.
