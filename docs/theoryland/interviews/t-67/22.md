#### Scandium2

How much longer do you anticipate the series will go on? I have heard ten, but is anything definite yet?

#### Robert Jordan

It will be at least ten books, yes. There will be some more books, not too many, and please God, not so many as I've already written. I am, in truth, writing as fast as I can. I want to maintain the pace of the story until I reach the final scene, which has been in my head since before I started writing
*The Eye of the World*
