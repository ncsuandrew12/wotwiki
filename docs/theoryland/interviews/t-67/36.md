#### Anastin B

Good evening Mr. Jordan. I was wondering if you were plaining on doing, or letting someone do, a companion book for the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

There is an illustrated guide to the world of the Wheel of Time in the works. It is planned to have 64 color illustrations and 80,000 words or so of text and it will include a good bit of information that I did not intend to put in the books. There will be a map of the entire world in the illustrated guide. I don't have an estimated publication date at this time.
