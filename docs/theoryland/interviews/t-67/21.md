#### Gaul Aiel

Will the next book take as long as
*A Crown of Swords*
to be released?

#### Robert Jordan

Probably...I am due to deliver it in the fall of next year which means it will come out probably in the spring of the year following that. I decided writing the books more slowly was better than falling over dead. :)
