# [Interview #67: AOL Chat 1, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=67#20)

#### AaronB20

Did your interaction with fans lead you to make certain things previously hidden obvious in this book?

#### Robert Jordan

No, not interaction with fans. There are always things that are going to become more obvious as the story goes along. I certainly don't intend to keep everything hidden until the very last. There won't be any Perry Mason revelation scene where all the characters sit down and say, "This is what happened and this is why it happened." :)
