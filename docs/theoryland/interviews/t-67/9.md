#### Shosh001

Mr. Jordan, can you tell us why Tor is sending you on tour for the
*Fallon*
series later this year, but not for
*A Crown of Swords*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, it was a very short time between handing in
*A Crown of Swords*
and its publication, and in fact, they weren't really sure when I'd finish so they couldn't make arrangements in advance. There's a possibility that the
*Fallon*
tour may be extended to encompass some of what we call
*A Crown of Swords*
territory.
