Mr. Jordan, you've outdone yourself with
*A Crown of Swords*
. My question concerns the True Power. How is it distinguishable from the One Power?

#### Robert Jordan

It's fairly self-evident from the book. What can be done with the True Power is very similar to what can be done with the One Power. Except that where the One Power is drawn from the True Source and is the force that drives the Wheel of Time and powers the universe, the so-called True Power is drawn from the Dark One. There are limits in the same ways there are limits to the One Power. It would be very long if I went into it too much, but some of those limits and costs of drawing on the Dark One are shown in
*A Crown of Swords*
.
