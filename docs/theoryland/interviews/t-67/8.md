#### Belsamar

OK. Let's see if this works. Hello, RJ. Just out of curiosity, do your predictions (Foretellings and Min's viewings) have a well, Delphic quality by accident, or by choice? And did you ever think of writing a copy of
*The Prophecies of the Dragon*
?

#### Robert Jordan

There's very little in the books that's by accidentâ€”very little...and no, I've never thought of writing out the complete
*Prophecies of the Dragon*
. As already stated in a previous book, they would comprise a volume of some 300 to 400 pages.
