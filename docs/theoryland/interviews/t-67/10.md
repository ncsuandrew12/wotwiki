# [Interview #67: AOL Chat 1, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=67#10)

#### JJVORSmith

My wife wonders why you left all the plot threads hanging at the end of
*A Crown of Swords*
. I have felt that
*A Crown of Swords*
is more like the middle of a book rather than a complete book by itself. Could you explain how you pace and structure your books in the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

Not inside the time we have for this interview! :) As with all of the books, there are some plot elements hanging and some resolved. In some, there are more plot elements tied up than others; some, fewer. It just depends on how the story line is running in that particular book.
