#### OMNI Muse

Folks, I'm getting some questions about how to contact Robert. You can send e-mail to his publisher at torbooks@panix.com and they'll forward it to him. Please do
*not*
send your manuscripts. :)

#### Robert Jordan

You can also reach Tor by snail mail at Tor Books, 175 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010, and if someone sends e-mail to me via Tor, please include a snail-mail address, because I don't send e-mail back (I'm not set up for it). :)
