#### StuuuuBush

Was Mat right about the "snakelike" guy being a
*gholam*
, and if so, are we to assume that the bad guys are going to have as much trouble stopping one as the good guys?

#### Robert Jordan

I guess he was right. Because after all, his source for the information was Birgitte, who has some memories of the War of the Power. And yes, if a
*gholam*
decided to turn against one of the Forsaken, the Forsaken would certainly have as much difficulty in stopping the attack as any other person would. They were, after all, created for the sole purpose of assassinating Aes Sedai.
