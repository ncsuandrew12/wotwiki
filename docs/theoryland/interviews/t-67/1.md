#### OMNI Muse

We're glad to have you here! I've got lots and lots of questions, and I'd like to ask you to briefly tell us about Wheel of Time before we get started. :)

#### Robert Jordan

It can't be done! Not briefly. This is Loial's country. :) I can't even do it in two or three pages. My advice is to read the books. :) And start with
*The Eye of the World*
, please. :) It works much better that way.

#### OMNI Muse

LOL! Okay, we have lots of fans out there, so let's get to the questions.
