#### OMNI Muse

Robert, we're getting questions about cover art. Do you get to choose the artist? The theme?

#### Robert Jordan

I choose the them...the theme, that is, and I give the cover art a general idea of the scene that I want. But then it's worked between him and the art department in NY. I do have some input and I have managed to get a few things changed to some degree. Rand, for instance, in the earlier books, was shown as no more than 5'-10" or 5'-11", and he is about 6'-5", in my eyes.
