Since there are currently Wheel of Time card games and video games in the works, what other media will we see in the future? Comic Books? Films?

#### Robert Jordan

I really don't know. I just take it as it comes. There will be a line of Wheel of Time fantasy clothing and jewelry. There's a company that wants to make Wheel of Time weaponsâ€”swords, etc., but nothing in the way of games that I can discuss.
