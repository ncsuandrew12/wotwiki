[Wheel of Time charity auction](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1048/Signed-leatherbound-THE-GATHERING-STORM-and-TOWERS-OF-MIDNIGHT-auction-for-Worldbuilders-charity)
for Worldbuilders is currently at $1,725.00. Wow!

I believe there are still slots available for the Magic the Gathering: Dark Ascension prerelease in West Valley this Friday. They don't count a slot as filled until you prepay, so give them
