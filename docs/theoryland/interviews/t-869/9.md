#### Michael Mason-D'Croz

The former Journal Star paperboy and Lincoln East High School graduate has achieved much in his life. And during much of his life, The Wheel of Time has been there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I don't know how to respond to the idea of writing The Wheel of Time," Sanderson said. "The whole opportunity happened because my favorite author has passed away. But because he hasn't been here, I've been able to work on the series that has meant the most to me throughout my life."
