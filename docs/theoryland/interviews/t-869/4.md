The best-selling series originally penned by the late Robert Jordan was first thought of as a trilogy; however, it has spanned 14 books and 23 years. When Jordan passed away in 2007, the series—and its ending—seemed to be in jeopardy. Then Sanderson stepped in.

Sanderson, who graduated from Brigham Young University and now calls Provo, Utah, home, was chosen for the job by Jordan's widow, Harriet McDougal, after he wrote a heartfelt eulogy for Jordan that was published on his website.

He felt mixed emotions about taking over the series.

"Working on it has been bittersweet," Sanderson said. "You just won the lottery, but you didn't even enter. Your grandfather passed away and left you the ticket."

#### Michael Mason-D'Croz

Even with those emotions, Sanderson jumped at the opportunity to take over the series, and now as it draws to a close, there are more mixed emotions.

"It feels very relaxing to be finished, but also extremely sad," Sanderson said. "It's relaxing like finishing a marathon—more relieving than anything."
