#### Michael Mason-D'Croz

With the series coming to a close, it now allows Sanderson to move on to his own material. He is working on the second Stormlight Archive book, which he hopes to release in November, and a couple of young adult novels.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"These are projects I had been working on for years and years, and I finally have some time to work on them," Sanderson said.

#### Michael Mason-D'Croz

Sanderson plans to release
*The Rithmatist*
in May and
*Steelheart*
, the first of a trilogy, in late summer or early fall.

*The Rithmatist*
follows Sanderson's normal fantasy themes. However,
*Steelheart*
is more of an action/adventure with some fantasy twists. In the book, the only people in the world with super powers are evil, and normal people organize ways to try to bring them to justice.

He sold the film rights to
*Steelheart*
to Random House after eight different companies bid on it.
