#### Michael Mason-D'Croz

Sanderson has a prominent place in the fantasy world, but he hasn't forgotten his roots. Although he's been gone since his college days, the 38-year-old tries to get back to Lincoln whenever possible, and he still identifies himself as a Husker.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I always follow the Huskers," Sanderson said. "Nebraska is very close to my heart. When people ask if I caught the (BYU) game, I'll say 'no.' I usually follow the Huskers instead."
