# [Interview #841, Entry #2]: SFX Profile: Robert Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=841#2)

#### SFX

But despite Jordan's attempts to discourage casual readers, "The Wheel Of Time" has acquired a dedicated and enthusiastic following.

#### Robert Jordan

It's a fantasy
*War And Peace*
, a story not only of individuals but also of cultures clashing across a continent. It will take at least three more books to finish. I worry that someone will walk up to me and say, 'I want an end to it now or I'm going to bash your head in.' On the other hand, I've had people threaten to desecrate my grave if I die before I finish it!

#### SFX

But if the main thrust of the story's already mapped out, couldn't another author complete it from Jordan's notes?

#### Robert Jordan

If I die, my computer's hard drive will be reformatted four times. I defy anybody to pull anything off it after that, and I've made arrangements that anyone who tries to finish the series after my death will have their kneecaps removed.

#### SFX

That's an ironic attitude for an author who gained kudos for his additions to Robert E. Howard's
*Conan*
saga, surely?

#### Robert Jordan

If he could reach us, I'm sure Howard would strangle me, Andy Offutt and all the rest of us. But I don't want somebody messing around with my characters, putting their boots all over my world.
