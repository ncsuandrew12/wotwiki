# [Interview #841: SFX Profile: Robert Jordan, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=841#1)

#### SFX

There's one major problem with huge fantasy series—picking up on them halfway through. Robert Jordan has one word of advice for anyone who's considering joining his epic "Wheel Of Time" saga with volume seven,
*A Crown Of Swords*
(SFX16; B), now out in paperback at £5.99.

#### Robert Jordan

Don't! Start on the paperback of the first book
*The Eye Of The World*
. The characters are innocent at the beginning and you see the world in a certain way through their eyes. One of themes of the books is the mutability of knowledge—you cannot possibly know the truth of an event unless you were there to see it, and then you know only what you observed yourself. So the characters suspect that some of what they know is wrong, but they never know which parts are wrong. Each book changes the books before.
