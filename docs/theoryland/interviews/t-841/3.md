# [Interview #841: SFX Profile: Robert Jordan, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=841#3)

#### SFX

It's a world where the conflicts between different factions of supposed heroes often take precedence over their preparations for battle against The Dark Lordâ€”indeed, at first glance it seems as if the main story hasn't even started yet.

#### Robert Jordan

The battle between good and evil is a big part of the story, but it's not easy to see how many of the struggles for advantage are actually motivated by the Dark One, by evil. People who've read the books a few times are beginning to spot what's happening, and that while our heroes don't realize it, the war against evil has been going on from the beginning.
