# [Interview #945: AMOL Signing Report - DomaniSway, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=945#19)

#### Question

Could you elaborate on some of your recent comments about the difficulty of writing shorter books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One of Brandon's favorite stories is "Harrison Bergeron" by Kurt Vonnegut, and it's only five pages long, but he has struggled with writing shorter works. He's tried, but he has felt bad at it and it's not something he's ever been trained in. He realized that he was trying to write shorter fiction for the wrong
reasonsâ€”he was doing it for New York and not because he wanted to do it. He feels that his best short work is
*Emperor's Soul*
.

He goes on to praise Harriet for her remarkable career, specifically pointing out her role in
*Ender's Game*
and
*Eye of the World*
, two of the greats in sci-fi/fantasy. Harriet modestly says, "I put my shoes on one foot at a time."
