# [Interview #945: AMOL Signing Report - DomaniSway, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=945#16)

#### Question

Why do the Shardblades in the Stormlight Archive have the effect on flesh (human tissue) that they do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He originally wrote the scene in the prologue with the assassin Szeth using a traditional sword, but it was so bloody and gruesome that Brandon was actually disgusted. He had to find a way to avoid that and so he
came up with a new way for the swords to behave.
