# [Interview #945, Entry #2]: AMOL Signing Report - DomaniSway](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=945#2)

#### DomaniSway

Right around 6:15 pm, we received word that Brandon and Harriet had arrived, and were smuggled into a back conference room to get our books signed and questions answered. An interesting outcome from our questions was that Brandon asked us to get people to compile a list of characters whose outcome was left out of the final book for potential inclusion in the upcoming encyclopedia.

Upon our return from the back room, we chose a winner of the costume contest we hosted, but since we only had one participant, the choice was pretty easy. He looked really good though.

Brandon and Harriet arrived upstairs and took a moment to admire everyone's handiwork... and promptly asked us to get it off of their table. They were thoroughly impressed, I'm sure.
