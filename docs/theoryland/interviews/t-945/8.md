#### Question

Did he get to include anything from his "Cool Stuff" list in the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A few things did end up in the book, but he wonâ€™t expand due to spoilers. He did say that he had ideas about gateways long before he was selected to finish the series. He wanted to include some of these ideas in
his own work but he was too worried about copying Robert Jordan, so they just stayed in his file. He was able to pull these ideas out and use them with Androl in
*A Memory of Light*
