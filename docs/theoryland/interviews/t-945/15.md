#### Question

Will you share the story of the day you got the phone call from Harriet about completing the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Here, Brandon reviewed the story, remarking that he was more nervous than on his wedding day.

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet added that she told Brandon that he was on her short list, but didn't reveal at the time that it really was a list with just one name. She said that she knew that he was a good writer but she didn't know just how superb he was going to be. He was "a great choice" to finish the series.
