# [Interview #945: AMOL Signing Report - DomaniSway, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=945#5)

#### Question

Is there anyone Brandon wanted to include in
*A Memory of Light*
but didn't get to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he was able to get to everyone. There were two major sequences cut from the book. One of
these will appear in the charity anthology
*Unfettered*
. The other character POV just didn't work.
