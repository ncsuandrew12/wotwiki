#### Question

Is there anyone Brandon wanted to include in
*A Memory of Light*
but didn't get to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he was able to get to everyone. There were two major sequences cut from the book. One of
these will appear in the charity anthology
*Unfettered*
. The other character POV just didn't work.
