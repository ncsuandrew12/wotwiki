#### Question

Loial is my favorite character in the series. Are his scenes in
*A Memory of Light*
written more by Brandon Sanderson or by Robert Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon replies by saying he will need to keep this vague due to not wanting to reveal spoilers to those who have not finished reading. He will answer this individually when the person comes up to him in line. He is against readers "looking" for him or for Robert Jordan in the books. The epilogue was entirely written by Robert Jordan, except for one portion that Brandon wrote.
