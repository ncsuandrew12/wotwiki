#### Macen

The Cognitive Realm, is Shadesmar a Roshar specific term?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Shadesmar is a Roshar specific term. But when I translate from what other people are saying in these books, I just translate it to Shadesmar. For instance, when Wit is talking about it, he's going to call it Shadesmar, he's just going to use the Roshar term. But no, Shadesmar is what--it's called there.
