#### Kythis

How did Pattern actually become a Shardblade even though he hadn't been fully pulled into the Physical Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was pulled into the Physical Realm before, when Shallan was younger. And she almost broke her bond.
Q: He didn't go mad though.
A: She didn't completely break the bond. She didn't reject him completely. But it was dangerous for a while.
