# [Interview #1108: WOR-Omaha, NE, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1108#4)

#### Question

There are some scientists talking about spren, and they seemed to be describing the positioning...[can't make out the rest].

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does, but it's really behind the scenes. This is just helping you understand the nature of spren, kind of their relationship to subatomic particles and quantum thery and things like this. There are relationships there. It's even one or two steps further than what you see in actual quantum physics. In this book you get a discussion of the theory on spren that should relate right back to that. Watch for stuff that Jasnah says about spren. It's worldbuilding stuff that's not part of the main story. It's fun for scientists.
