# [Interview #1108: WOR-Omaha, NE, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1108#15)

#### Macen

We know that 10 is an odd number in the cosmere. And I noticed that the Lord Ruler specifically released 10 Allomantic metals. Is there a reason behind that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that was a coincidence right there. 10 is an odd cosmere number for Roshar, and there are reasons why it is
Macen: But it wasn't just Roshar, it was also Nalthis and Warbreaker.
Brandon: Nope, that one is a coincidence. Sometimes they just pop up that way. Part of the original reason that Roshar was 10 was I was going for a 10 day like Robert Jordan did, which I thought was cool. But then I ended up writing the Wheel of Time so I have to do something different now. So it turned into the two five-day weeks. Two five-days becoming a 50 day month.
