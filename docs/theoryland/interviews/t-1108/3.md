#### Question

So do you know what the end of the series is going to [can't make out the rest].

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do. I've actually written the epilogue to book five. Peter, my assistant, like sent an exclamation point after he saw that appear on the wiki. Actually the ending of the entire series, of the ten books, is somewhere in the two books. Just like in Mistborn it was in the first page. It's not in the first page but it's in those books.

#### Footnote

Some spelling errors corrected in the answer
