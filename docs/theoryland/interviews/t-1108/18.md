#### Macen

[Not sure on this] Is there something important about the stone, and the girl that's missing that has to do kind of with the stone, and how Tien gives him rocks?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some of that you're reading too much into, but something is real. I'm not going to tell you what is what. But there's definitely something about that.

#### Footnote

This is probably a reference to Tien's obsession with shiny rocks.
