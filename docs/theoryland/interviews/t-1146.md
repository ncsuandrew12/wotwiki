## [Entry #1](./t-1146/1)

#### Dearius

We know that investiture physically affects and changes people's bodies, so aside from the chance of being born as a misting, feruchemist, ect. Can investiture physically or biologically affect the magic user's descendants, and if so then in what way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are on to something there, but I can't give details without spoilers. He then elaborated that it plays a major part on Sel. In response I asked if the Alethi were descendants of the original Knights Radiant and if their descendants had light eyes due to their ancestor's use of stormlight/Natal Bond. He said I was on to something but to RAFO.

## [Entry #2](./t-1146/2)

#### PrncRny

Did Hoid have anything to do with Bavadin showing up on Sel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. (Though interestingly, he asked me why I asked this question. I said I got it off a question list here and he stated that people had been trying to get him to say something on the subject for a while. Trying to pry information from him. Hence the RAFO.)

## [Entry #3](./t-1146/3)

#### PrncRny

How much of Harmony's manipulation of Wax was Hoid aware of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He knew what was going on. That's all I'm going to say.

## [Entry #4](./t-1146/4)

#### PrncRny

Is an Snapped Allomancer more likely to pass on the Allomantic ability than an UnSnapped one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not necessarily. (I asked if it was pure genetics, then, and he initially said yes, then appended that with 'not just genetics. there's a spiritual aspect to it as well.')

## [Entry #5](./t-1146/5)

#### PrncRny

Is the flute that Vin saw in the Lord Ruler's secret room in WoA the same flute that Hoid gives to Kaladin in tWoK?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. The origins of that flute will be revealed at some point.

## [Entry #6](./t-1146/6)

#### Seonid

"If Cultivation and Honor were romantically involved, why did Cultivation not help Honor against Odium?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"She did."

## [Entry #7](./t-1146/7)

#### [Shawn M. HalversonÂ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/270545169744383/permalink/731811053617790/)](Facebook-Stormlight Archive)

So I just got back from the book signing Brandon held today, I asked him about the time between each of the original 99 desolations.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It turns out that the number 99 in the stories was made up, and that there were much fewer of them. He also then stated that the cosmere runs along a 10,000 year gap and that Roshar falls right into the middle of the timeline. He ended with "That should give you a perspective of the timeline and events of the desolations". I figured that if anyone wanted to know a bit more of Roshar's history they might find this interesting.
