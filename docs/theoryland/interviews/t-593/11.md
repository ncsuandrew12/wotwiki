# [Interview #593: Reddit Fantasy Bookclub Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=593#11)

First off, I really enjoyed
*The Way of Kings*
. I became more emotionally attached to the characters in this book than I did in
*Mistborn*
or
*Elantris*
. Dalinar and Kaladin are some of my favorite literary characters of all time.

My question is in regards to the audio book version of
*The Way of Kings*
. I think Michael Kramer and Kate Reading did a great job narrating the book and creating voices for each of the characters but I wanted to know what you thought about it. Do you feel like the characters were portrayed accurately based on your original ideas for them?

I'm also reading WoT for the first time. I just finished
*A Crown of Swords*
and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens and how you complete the series. I just hope it doesn't delay the sequel to
*The Way of Kings*
too much. ;)

I asked for Michael and Kate specifically, since I've liked their work on the Wheel of Time. That said, it's always an odd experience to hear the book read by someone else. In fact, I find it an odder experience than getting cover art, which is arguably a larger 'interpretation' of my work than a reading is. I think with the reading, I find myself wanting to tweak and change things, so it's kind of a nerve-wracking experience.

I think Michael and Kate did a great job, though sometimes, it's a strange experience to hear voices I associate with WoT characters being used for someone else.
