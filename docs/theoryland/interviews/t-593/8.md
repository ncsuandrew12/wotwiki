# [Interview #593: Reddit Fantasy Bookclub Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=593#8)

More a technical question,

What is your day-to-day writing process like? I've heard from a variety of authors who go by words per day or by time or something similar. What processes do you use to write such long pieces in reasonable times?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I write every day, and I give myself wordcount goals. (Usually, it's 2k min, or a certain page goal if revising.) I try to keep distractions to a minimum.

...Reddit doesn't exactly help with that last part. :)
