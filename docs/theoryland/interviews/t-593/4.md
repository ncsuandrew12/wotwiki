# [Interview #593: Reddit Fantasy Bookclub Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=593#4)

How long does it take to make a universe, how deep do you go?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the book, honestly. For a thick, multi-volume epic fantasy, I take years working on the world. Such was the case with
*The Way of Kings*
, and a few of the other massive Epics I'm planning.
*Mistborn*
had about a year of planning ahead of time.

Some books, however, I write more freely. I almost always spend a few months working on the world before writing; it's the thing I feel I need best fleshed out. However, it is dangerous as well. Some writers spend all of their time worldbuilding and none of their time writing.

I try to focus my energies on areas of worldbuilding important to the conflict and the characters. In
*Mistborn*
, the languages weren't important—I was going to have everyone speaking one language. In
*Kings*
, language was more important, so I developed the linguistics. (Though that won't be manifest for a few more books.)
