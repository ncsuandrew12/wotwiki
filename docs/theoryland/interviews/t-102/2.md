# [Interview #102: TPOD Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=102#2)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that a channeler can hide strength as well as ability to channel, but added that 1) few people know how to do it, and 2) the Aes Sedai don't even know these tricks are possible.

#### John Nowacki

Those caveats are rather obvious, I know. But I mention this answer because I thought I heard it reported here that this question was met with "RAFO" in the past. I'm sure someone will clarify that for me.
