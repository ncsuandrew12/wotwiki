# [Interview #102: TPOD Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=102#1)

#### John Nowacki

Regarding today's signing at Olsson's in DC:

Fairly small crowd, as expected. Very few questions asked (that I overheard), though RJ did repeat the "I've known the last scene since..." bit at least four or five times.

He also told one fellow who wanted a photograph that he didn't mind having his picture taken, but he insisted on keeping his clothes on. Someone in the line said "Damn!" rather loudly, and RJ looked back and said that he hears that a lot. Well...
