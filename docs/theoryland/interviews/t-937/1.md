Borderlands Books, in the heart of San Francisco's Mission District, on an impossibly gorgeous day in the beginning of February. The town is alive with the start of the Lunar New Year festival, as well as the local baseball team's fan festival celebrating their world series win.

With that in mind, is it any wonder that the stretch limo bearing Brandon and Harriet was nearly an hour late? The store rocked with the tension of 265 people waiting for the final showdown, the last interaction with the Wheel that never stops spinning. And really, the air practically hummed with the joined murmurs of the waiting, punctuated with the occasional bursts of nervous laughter. And we, the Memory Keepers, waited.

Eventually, Sanderson and Harriet showed up, and we got some 20 minutes to hang out with them. Brandon? Taller than you expect. No, even taller than that. Our conversation was casual, relaxed, and almost entirely spoiler free. It was more about the nature of touring, and the nature of writing. We felt so at ease.
