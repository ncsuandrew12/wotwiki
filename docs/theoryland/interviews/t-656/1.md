# [Interview #656: Sydney Signing Report - Donald Lowe, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=656#1)

#### Robert Jordan

At a recent RJ event in Australia, I actually asked RJ about reversing a circle-induced turning to the Dark and got the (somewhat predictable) RAFO.

#### DONALD LOWE

Given the number of mentions this has gotten in the book, one suspects someone/s will forcibly be turned to the dark ... whether they can be
"unturned" remains to be seen. Has anyone speculated on
*why*
a channeler is susceptible?

cheers
  
Don
