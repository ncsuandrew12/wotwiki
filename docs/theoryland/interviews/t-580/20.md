# [Interview #580, Entry #20]: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#20)

#### Question

Someone asked about why the clouds are clearing and whether they were clearing around certain important women in the story.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that the clouds are clearing around Rand, but it has not been specified whether that's because of
*ta'veren*
, the Fisher King or another reason entirely. He said that the clouds had cleared over Aviendha in the Waste and we have not seen whether the clouds have cleared over Tuon, but Tuon is still somewhat behind the other characters at the end of
*Towers of Midnight*
. He also said the clouds have not cleared over Seandar.
