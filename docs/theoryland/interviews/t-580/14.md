# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#14)

#### Jonathan B

I asked about why Grady didn't tie off the gateways to move Perrin's troops if he was too tired to keep them open.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon says that this was part of the instructions he had, so he didn't want to change it (my speculation is that I think that means it was probably in the notes themselves but I don't know that for sure). He said that it makes sense for tying off gateways to have a cost for the channeler to maintain because if it were so easy to create gateways and tie them off, it could be very breaking for the logistics of the world. If this were possible in the Age of Legends for example, why would anyone need a horse or a wagon or to develop any other kind of technology to transport anything? There could just be tied off gateways from everywhere to everywhere else.
