# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#22)

#### Jonathan B

We discussed Demandred; I don't remember how or why it came up, but I said that the most popular theory currently is that he's Roderan of Murandy. I didn't ask who Demandred is because I knew that would get a big fat RAFO.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said "aren't there a lot of people who think its Paitar"?

#### JONATHAN B

I said not that I knew as, RJ said we hadn't seen Demandred's alias on-screen prior to
*Knife of Dreams*
and we had seen Paitar before. Roderan is basically the only important king of Randland or one of them that we haven't seen on screen.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He didn't deny or confirm any of the above.
