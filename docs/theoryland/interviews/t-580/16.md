# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#16)

#### Jonathan B

I also asked if there was anything in
*A Memory of Light*
like the big unnoticed thing in
*Towers of Midnight*
that we should look for.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said there are lots of little things that come to fruition in interesting ways.

#### JONATHAN B

I said yeah, I can't wait to see how "his blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul" turns out. Do you know there are some people that think Elayne will have her babies on Shayol Ghul and that will fulfill the prophecy?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He said well, Elayne is like four months pregnant at this point... Lots of things are possible with the One Power though.

#### JONATHAN B

In my mind, this debunks that theory somewhat.
