#### Question

Another question was, how much of the books was him and how much was RJ?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that for
*The Gathering Storm*
,
*Towers of Midnight*
, and
*A Memory of Light*
, he had about 200,000 words of written material including notes dedicated to that story . He also had dictations dedicated to the
*A Memory of Light*
material + dictations and the other general notes for the series. He made the parable of someone who has pieces of a Ming vase for which he had some pieces but others are missing and he had to put it all back together to make a whole. He did say that for this book, more of Mat was RJ and more of Perrin was him. I think that he has done a really great job.
