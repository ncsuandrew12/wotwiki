# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#23)

#### Jonathan B

All this talk about gateways now has me curious if gateways always have to be flat or if there could ever be a curved gateway. But I didn't think to ask that. For example, could you make a spherical gateway around somebody with the destination being a fiery pit and they couldn't move otherwise they'd be toast? If someone made a circular gateway, how would that look on the other side (a big round sphere of nothing... ?)
