# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He mentioned that doing
*Towers of Midnight*
and rewriting/editing
*The Way of Kings*
the same year was quite intense in terms of time. He is still committed to getting books out quickly and regularly, but
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
in one year was more than he wants to do on a regular basis.

He is going to take three months to reread the series and plans to have
*A Memory of Light*
done by end 2011 for a release in early 2012.
