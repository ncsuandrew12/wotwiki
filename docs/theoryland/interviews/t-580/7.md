#### Question

Someone asked how the Trollocs are getting enough food in the Blight; they can't just eat each other right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that the number of Trollocs in the Blight currently is unsustainable over a long period of time but we should remember that the Shadow does has access to channelers that can create gateways (implied: as a means to bring food TO the Trollocs).
