# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#7)

#### Question

Someone asked how the Trollocs are getting enough food in the Blight; they can't just eat each other right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that the number of Trollocs in the Blight currently is unsustainable over a long period of time but we should remember that the Shadow does has access to channelers that can create gateways (implied: as a means to bring food TO the Trollocs).
