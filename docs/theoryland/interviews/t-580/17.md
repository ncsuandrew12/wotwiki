# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#17)

#### Julien

Julien asked if the incident where Perrin comes back from
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
with blood of someone else on his face was a mistake or something else (usually you get blood from your own wounds but not others when exiting
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said remembering thinking it was odd at the time when he read it but asked for an email and find out for that question.

#### JULIEN

[Julien] also asked if Rand had quit smoking since we hadn't seen him smoking tabac recently.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Brandon says that if he can't get two rivers tabac he would rather not smoke anything and Rand has been a busy guy lately. He compared it to being used to really good French wine and then having only bad American wine available, in which case Rand would rather not consume. Rather funny.
