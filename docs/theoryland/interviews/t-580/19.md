#### Julien

He also asked what was the riddle that the Snakes & Foxes told Rand that gave him the answer about how to cleanse
*saidin*
. We know their answer to "How can I win the Last Battle?", "How can I survive the Last Battle?" and we know the result of Rand's third answer about cleansing the source but we don't know what the
*riddle*
was.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon was not sure if he could tell us this without giving something away so he got an email and find out on this question.
