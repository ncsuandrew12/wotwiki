# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#15)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I asked if there would be another Great Hunt for
*A Memory of Light*
and Brandon said yes and he is thinking about putting in all the chapter names. He said we will notice in
*Towers of Midnight*
that not all of the chapter names got put in because he took out some of the ones that he thought would be so easy to guess. Because of this filtering on the chapter names, he was impressed that we guessed so many. I told him that there were 6000 failed guesses we listed and about the list and search engine that was made by Theorylanders to avoid making the same wrong guesses and he was very impressed by that. He said Tor was surprised by the success of the Hunt and that they were very pleased.

At dinner, Cuthbert told us in detail about his involvment with the last clue. He had to get up on the chair of the photobooth to look at what was on top and a lot of the security guards were looking at him funny. He also got a lot of Twitter followers and people encouraging him to go get the clue.
