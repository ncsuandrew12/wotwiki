# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#8)

#### Question

Someone asked if the Seanchan taking over the entire world would be a victory for the Light or the Dark.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said it would be a victory for the Light because the Dark One would not have won. He said that the Forsaken have different visions of what a victory for the Dark would mean. Ishamael thinks it will mean the destruction of everything and the end of time whereas Graendal thinks that he will remake the world.
