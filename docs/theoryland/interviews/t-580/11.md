# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#11)

#### Jonathan B

I asked if he could confirm definitively that Cyndane is Lanfear and end of story since there were still some people saying maybe Cyndane isn't Lanfear.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that anything regarding Lanfear is RAFO at this point because there is likely to be information about that in the next book and there are hints about what is going on with her in
*Towers of Midnight*
.
