# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#24)

#### Jonathan B

We talked about the order of the chapters as some people were confused by Tam being in two places at once.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said there was no way around this as they had to catch Perrin up. Then we asked if there was a chance of getting the last three books re-released with the chapters in chronological order. He said this might be possible as an e-book or maybe a rearranged audiobook. Only the chapter orders would be changed.

#### JONATHAN B

You couldn't fit it all in one published book and it would just be weird to have three separate volumes published again with the chapters in different orders. I could totally see an ebook or one huge rearranged audiobook though as something attractive and maybe not too costly to produce that some HCFFs like us would enjoy having.

#### Footnote

To quote Brandon from another interview: "The plotlines
