# [Interview #580: Paris Signing Report - Jonathan B, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=580#12)

#### Jonathan B

We discussed the
*gholam*
; if someone had pushed it through a gateway, would it have just died?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that
*gholam*
CAN go THROUGH gateways (from one place to another).
*Gholam*
are Shadowspawn of a more perfected kind. It would have been way too easy to kill if you just needed to shove it through a gateway (to another place). However, falling through the skimming gateway for a few minutes did kill the
*gholam*
and it is really dead and it's not going to show up again. This makes me wonder now if one of Rand/Logain's Deathgates would have killed it but I didn't think to ask at the time.
