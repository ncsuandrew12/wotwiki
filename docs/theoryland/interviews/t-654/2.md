# [Interview #654: LOC Signing Report - Mike Allen, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=654#2)

#### Mike Allen

After my turn in the wheel of signings, I joined a bunch of other Net fiends in the corner, whispering about this or that. I asked their opinions on why the Hundred Companions were all men, when the greatest works were always accomplished by men and women together. Another person (Dana, I believe) suggested that it might be because when one part of a link failed, the whole thing failed, and that in a combat situation it would be impossible to maintain a proper circle. None of us knew if that was true or not, so someone brought it to RJ's attention.

#### Robert Jordan

His response was what you probably predicted: "You want me to give a clue like that away for nothing?" Feeling brash, I then said, "OK, just why were the Hundred Companions all men?" He merely grumbled and shook his head as he signed the next book.
