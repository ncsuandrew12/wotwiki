#### Robert Jordan

He raised the point that Rand's creeping insanity may manifest in much more subtle ways than the people of Randland expect...which leads one to wonder about Rand's increasing withdrawal and possible megalomania. I think he is aware of the net discussion: he expressed surprise at the amount of analysis and comparison with Tolkien,
*Dune*
etc. (I felt tempted to mention A. A. Milne) and somebody in the audience compared WoT to
*Atlas Shrugged*
, which really seemed to surprise him. His attitude is that once he has written one book (and publicized it) it is time to move on to the next...The only deliberate connection between WoT and any other modern fantasy was giving the first 100-odd pages of
*The Eye of the World*
a
*Lord of the Rings*
-esque flavor, to start people off in familiar territory.
