# [Interview #14: Trinity College Q&A, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=14#1)

#### Emmet O'Brien

Robert Jordan arrived at 6:00 this evening in Trinity College for his talk...this being Ireland, the talk didn't start for a further ten minutes, but in the meantime he signed books for those of us who actually turned up on time. The turn out was pretty disappointing considering
*The Fires of Heaven*
is number two on the best-seller lists here: only about thirty people were there including SF society mafia. He didn't have any prepared speech but took questions from the floor.

#### Robert Jordan

He still isn't sure how long WoT will go on for, saying probably seven books but adding that when
*The Eye of the World*
first came out he saw the series as four books. He does however know what the ending will be and how all the major story lines will resolve. He expressed vague dissatisfaction with the covers but didn't seem too upset about them.
