# [Interview #409: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Splitting AMoL, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=409#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

By now, many of you know about the
[press release that Tor put up](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=19734)
about
*A Memory of Light*
being split.

Well, I do have a reaction I wrote to this.
[I posted it as a separate article](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/56/Splitting-AMOL)
on my website so that those of you who watch the blog via RSS or LJ wouldn't have to deal with eight pages of writing if you don't want to. It's long, but it's mostly me talking about the process of writing this book over the last sixteen months. I think the Wheel of Time readers will find it very interesting read.
