Question for those in the know: is the written content in the WoT ARCs or galley copies any different from the retail version? Any changed lines or new/missing parts?

I own a few ARCs of other books, and they don't seem any different from the retail version (as far as I can tell), but reviewers were asked to make sure any quoted text matched with the final version.

For the various versions that I have of this series, the results are all over the place; here are few examples:

A lot of the pre-publication versions I have such as
*The Great Hunt*
,
*The Dragon Reborn*
,
*The Fires of Heaven*
,
*Winter's Heart*
and
*Knife of Dreams*
have no obvious noticeable differences from the retail versions (although I haven't read through each in great detail so as to not damage them).

The galley for
*The Shadow Rising*
has a prologue of approximately 1.5 pages that was integrated into the first chapter of the finished book.

The advance version (2-book set) for
*Lord of Chaos*
has line edits, handwritten notes including some chapter titles written in and notes of what icon is to be used for certain chapters.

For
*The Path of Daggers*
, the book I have is labeled as an advance uncorrected bound manuscript that includes tons of changes: many, many line edits, actual chapter revision numbers, and in one spot, a chapter was moved to a different sequence in the book, and that's just what I noticed scanning through it quickly a few years ago.

My intention always has been, if/whenever I get the time to do a detailed review of each book, but that maybe just a pipe dream as I own a small business that consumes my life.

I started discussing some of this with Bob Kluttz of Encyclopaedia-Wot a few years ago in order to try get some info posted on-line, but I don't have the time to do the work nor the space or skills to post the info.

Hope this helps a little.
