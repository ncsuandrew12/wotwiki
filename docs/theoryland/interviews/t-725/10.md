# [Interview #725: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Loialson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=725#10)

#### Loialson

Aviendha told Rand in
*Lord of Chaos*
that
*ji'e'toh*
was who the Aiel were, at their core. Do the Aiel need to find some other purpose/faith besides
*ji'e'toh*
to avoid the calamitous future that Aviendha saw in the Way-forward
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that...a half yes. They don't need to abandon
*ji'e'toh*
or find a new
*ji'e'toh*
but they may have to adapt
*ji'e'toh*
to certain other things....
