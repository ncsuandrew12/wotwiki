#### Loialson

Is the Dark One's touch still on Fain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Umm...yes, you don't abandon it that easily, but, the other touch on Fain is far more dominant.

#### LOIALSON

That would be Mordeth?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes.

#### LOIALSON

Is Fain still a Darkfriend?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I don't know if Fain counts as a Darkfriend anymore. I think Fain is his own faction.

#### LOIALSON

How is Fain getting Trollocs and Myrddraal to follow him if he is not a Darkfriend?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He is using...other means...they aren't following him because he is a Darkfriend. Certainly not [he smiles a bit here].

#### LOIALSON

Is Mat still attached in any way to Fain's dagger?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Read and Find out.
