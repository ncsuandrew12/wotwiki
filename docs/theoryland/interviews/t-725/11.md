# [Interview #725, Entry #11]: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Loialson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=725#11)

#### Loialson

In
*Lord of Chaos*
, Nynaeve and Elayne searched for something that would tie the Salidar Aes Sedai to Rand via Need in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
.

Need led them to three things. First it led them to the White Tower, (where Elayne glimpsed Egwene briefly), then Need shifted Nynaeve and Elayne to a locked storeroom within the White Tower (they thought that was useless). After that, Need led them to the Bowl of the Winds. My questions are regarding the first two things Need brought them to.

On the first thing, was Need bringing them to Egwene?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe it was Egwene.

#### LOIALSON

On the second thing, what was the item Need brought them to in that storeroom?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

RAFO.

#### LOIALSON

Was that something besides the Horn of Valere?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It could be.

#### LOIALSON

[I felt that this question was grasping at straws here a bit from the impression I got from him, i.e. it's not that important regarding what the item is, but that it will come into play. And it's not the Horn of Valere in this case. I could be wrong, that's just the vibe I got.]
