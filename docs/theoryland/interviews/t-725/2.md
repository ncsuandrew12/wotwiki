#### Sean

I had a question—feel free to RAFO this if you need to—but, will we find out what the Book of Translation is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Send me an email.

#### Sean

I can PM you on Reddit.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, PM me on Reddit.... That's like, something I think that's more appropriate for the Encyclopedia, personally; but I'll see if I can make that work.

#### Footnote

PMing Brandon on any site (Facebook, etc.) is usually not a good way to try to get in touch with him.
