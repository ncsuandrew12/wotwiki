# [Interview #973: AMOL Signing Report - Kazmero, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=973#4)

#### Kazmero

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

When asked how often he plays Magic: the Gathering, Brandon says about once a month and that he doesn't play online because Magic is a reason for him to get out of the house. He was also pretty excited that he'd gotten a tour of Wizards of the West Coast while in Seattle, where they gave him some special cards, etc. I wish I had more time to ask him more about Magic and how it's affected his writing and what he likes about it, etc.
