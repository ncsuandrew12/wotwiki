# [Interview #973: AMOL Signing Report - Kazmero, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=973#2)

#### Kazmero

For the Q&A he went closer to an hour than the scheduled half an hour, which was greatly appreciated.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He answered questions regarding his writing practice (at least 2000 words per day), the editing process of WOT, and strategies for working with more than one editor at a publishing house to get your own book published.

#### Kazmero

I also know that he asked each person that brought a book to get signed if they had any questions for him. It was fun for each of us to take a few minutes here and there to listen to the variety of questions and answers.
