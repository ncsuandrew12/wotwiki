# [Interview #973: AMOL Signing Report - Kazmero, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=973#5)

#### Kazmero

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

One of the other comments that stuck out for me was his awareness of how tours could be difficult for rock stars, resulting in some of them drinking excessively, etc. He talked about the drop in energy that happens from when you're in front of several hundred appreciative, adoring fans (tens of thousands for rock stars) then going back to your hotel room and being by yourself. What a roller coaster ride.
