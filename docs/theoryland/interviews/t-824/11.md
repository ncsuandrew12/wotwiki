# [Interview #824: Dragonmount Interview with Teresa Patterson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=824#11)

#### Bob Kluttz

Can you recall any specific areas of the book where you were on your own? Conversely, what parts did Robert Jordan write or verify?

#### Teresa Patterson

RJ verified everything. He is the property holder and I wrote at his pleasure. There were some sections which I was allowed to play with—so long as it stayed within his vision of course—and others which were completely his. It has been long enough that I no longer recall which parts of the book were wholly mine—especially since the short stories that were originally scattered throughout the manuscript were all cut in the final version—but I can tell you that certain parts—such as the History of Artur Hawkwing and the Calendar and dating systems were wholly Robert Jordan.
