Did you work with him in his home office or exchange data by phone and e-mail? What was a typical workday like?

#### Teresa Patterson

First, we (the lead artist, the packager, and myself) all re-read all the then current books. I made notes and highlighted things I wanted to explore. Then at a preset time, we spent a week or so at RJ and Harriet's wonderful colonial home. I used the time to pick RJ's brain about his world and Todd used the time to make sketches of places and characters for his approval. He then also supplemented the discussions with a large packet of written materials and notes that he had made while writing the series. I organized the materials into an order and format that seemed sensible and then filled in the gaps if necessary. We communicated by phone or mail when necessary. As I completed each section of the manuscript it was then sent back to RJ for his notes, corrections, and approval. I made any requested changes. Then the finished book was sent to the packager, and on to the publisher. The publisher then made additional changesâ€”some of which I did not know about until the book was released.
