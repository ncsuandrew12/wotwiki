# [Interview #824: Dragonmount Interview with Teresa Patterson, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=824#15)

#### Bob Kluttz

Are there any plans to update the book with new information? Would you be interested in such a project?

#### Teresa Patterson

So far as I know there are no plans to update the book. I would certainly be willing to work on an update, and have recently completed working on an updated version of my other Worldbook for the Shannara series for Terry Brooks. In that case I found revisiting the world was like returning to an old friend. I suspect that would also be the case with Rand's world.
