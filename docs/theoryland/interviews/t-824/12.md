# [Interview #824: Dragonmount Interview with Teresa Patterson, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=824#12)

#### Bob Kluttz

Did you have direct access to any of Robert Jordan's files? Did you pick up any juicy tidbits? Any that you can share?

#### Teresa Patterson

He gave me access to a lot of notes and information. But there is nothing I can share that was not already in the book. I can tell you that I did clearly see the inspiration for the women in his book in RJ's wife, Harriet.
