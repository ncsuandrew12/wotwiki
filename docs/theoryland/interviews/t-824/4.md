#### Bob Kluttz

Do you consider yourself more as an artist or a writer?

#### Teresa Patterson

I am a writer who does balloon art to make my living. Writing pays, but not well enough to support my household without help. My eventual hope is to give up sculpting to write full time. I have always considered myself to be a writer who is an art advocate. I love art. I used to paint, but discovered there are lots of people who can paint and draw better than I can. I am a good art director, and I love hanging with the artists, but I am a better writer. And the pay is better once you get to a certain level. The best artists in our genre cannot come close to making the money the top writers can make.
