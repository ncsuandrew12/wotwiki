#### Bob Kluttz

What are your thoughts on Robert Jordan's characters? Are there any that you identify with?

#### Teresa Patterson

Surprisingly, despite the fact that I am a woman, I identified with most of the young men, especially Mat and Perrin. The women always seem a little mean spirited and petty to me. I always wanted to know what they were going to do next, but I couldn't identify with them.
