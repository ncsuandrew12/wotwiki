How does a project like the Wheel of Time world book get set up?

#### Teresa Patterson

World books, like the one for the Wheel of Time are usually put together by a Packager—in this case Bill Fawcett—who, with the approval of the publishing house and the series author, puts together a team of artists and a writer to do the project. The publishing house and the series author then approve the choices for main author and artist. Once that is done contracts are issued and the project begins.
