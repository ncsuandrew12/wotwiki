#### Dragonmount

#### Bob Kluttz

We were fortunate enough to get hold of Teresa Patterson, Co-Author of
*The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time*
(commonly referred to as "The Guide"). Teresa keeps a very busy schedule, so we were thrilled when she agreed to sit down with us for a few minutes and answer our questions.

#### Footnote

The book is also commonly referred to as the Big White Book (BWB) or the BBoBA (Big Book of Bad Art).
