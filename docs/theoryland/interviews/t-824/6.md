What projects do you have going now or in the near future?

#### Teresa Patterson

Last fall I finished working on an expansion for the
*World of Shannara*
book that will bring that world book up to date with the 6 books in the series since the first version of the world book was released. The new expansion section features illustrations by Rob Alexander. I am not sure when the new version is set to be released—probably in early 2006.

Outside of the SF world I recently finished ghost writing a real-life military adventure that is due out later this year. Of course, since it is a ghost project, I can't tell you more about it, other that it involves a Navy Seal. If I told you more—I'd have to kill you. (grin). I am also working on some short stories for various anthologies.
