I got back from JordanCon a few days ago. Often times at cons and signings, my readers bring me small gifts. I'm deeply grateful for the time and thought put into these, and I try to post pictures of some of them from time to time. JordanCon was no exception. Here are some of the cool things you all gave me.

A highlight of the con for me was going to lunch with one of my idols, Michael Whelan. (For more on how much I love his work,
[see here](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/03/michael-whelan-an-apreciation)
.) He gave me one of the signed limited editions of
*The Art of Michael Whelan*
, which includes a beautiful original illustration (below). The book and the illustration are absolutely gorgeous. I can't wait to see what Michael comes up with for the cover of
*Words of Radiance*
.

Together Jennifer and Jimmy Liang head up JordanCon each year and do a smashing job of it. This year Jimmy wanted to get me Magic cards in Korean. Instead, his search turned up these cards in Chinese:

Of course, readers brought me all sorts of other goodies: mac and cheese, more Magic cards (vintage!), books, an awesome wooden baby rattle, traditional songs rewritten with Wheel of Time-inspired lyrics, and a book of letters from the Black Tower Social Group from Dragonmount.

Matt Hatch from Theoryland brought me a shirt and art print with a symbol based on the Dusty Wheel from
*Towers of Midnight*
. As a cool side note, the pipe drawing is based on one of Robert Jordan's actual pipes. If you're interested in buying one of these shirts, they're available at
[InkWing](http://store.inkwing.com/)
. (Also note that
[Ta'veren Tees](http://store.inkwing.com/)
has many types of Wheel of Time shirts.)
