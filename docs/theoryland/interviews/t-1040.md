## [Entry #1](./t-1040/1)

#### Question

Is the Nightwatcher Cultivation or of Cultivation somehow?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is strongly hinted in the book.

## [Entry #2](./t-1040/2)

#### Question

Are Shallan's "memories" a form of surgebinding?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question! Shallan has something besides pure physiology aiding her when taking a memory.

## [Entry #3](./t-1040/3)

#### Question

Will Shallan and Hoid meet and have a battle of wits?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question! I think you should read
*Words of Radiance*
and find out.

## [Entry #4](./t-1040/4)

#### Question

Is Baxil's Mistress destroying statues of the Herald Shalash?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Actually in the prologue her statue is missing because Baxil's mistress came through.

## [Entry #5](./t-1040/5)

#### Question

Is Baxil's mistress Shalash?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not going to answer that.
