# [Interview #658, Entry #4]: COT Signing Report - Daniel Adams](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=658#4)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked him if he thought he'd finish his series before George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice & Fire', and he said absolutely. He then mentioned a poll he had seen online where readers were asked which would happen first - Robert Jordan finishes the WOT series, George R.R. Martin would finish ASOIAF, Stephen King would finish the Dark Tower, or the Universe would be destroyed. D was winning by about 65% last he'd checked.
