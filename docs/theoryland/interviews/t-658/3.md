# [Interview #658: COT Signing Report - Daniel Adams, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=658#3)

#### Robert Jordan

He arrived shortly after Noon, and greeted us all, followed by the 'true pronunciations' the other stops received, and the announcement that pictures were fine, but if you were a guy, keep the clothes on. Because of the location (in aisle 14 next to the toys :), there wasn't room for much of an introduction, so he quickly sat down and began signing. Though I didn't hear the questions, he did spout a couple of his patented RAFO answers to some gentlemen in front of me. As the guy directly in front of me was having his book signed, I snapped a quick photo with my camera. Robert started ranting over people 'snapping shots of the top of my head!' It was all in good humor though. He wondered "what is it about the top of my head that people find so photogenic?" "I'm thinking of selling & bottling some of my hair, calling it Eau'd to Robert Jordan's head!" He said "I love having pictures taken, I'm a camera slut! You can take as many pictures as you want, as long as there are no bunny ears!" A very humorous guy!
