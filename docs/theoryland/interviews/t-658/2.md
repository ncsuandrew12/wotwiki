# [Interview #658, Entry #2]: COT Signing Report - Daniel Adams](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=658#2)

#### Daniel Adams

Keep up the outstanding job you're doing on your website! I just wanted to drop you a quick note on RJ's booksigning tour, as of today (Jan 15th) he was in Cincinnati OH. He was here last night at a Borders Books, but I was unable to make it to that event. Instead I went to his Noon - 2:00PM appearance at the Kroger's store in Beechmont, along with probably 75 or so other fans.
