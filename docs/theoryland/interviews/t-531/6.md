# [Interview #531: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: New Brandon Sanderson Interview, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=531#6)

#### Patrick

Your solo adult novels have these recurring elements such as the character of Hoid and references to the Shards. In Mistborn,
*Elantris*
and
*Warbreaker*
these elements are minor and more along the lines of easter eggs, but they seem to be more prominent in
*The Way of Kings*
. Can we expect these elements to be expanded on further in future Stormlight books? Will we find out Hoid's full story in this series or are you holding off on that for now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will mostly RAFO that. Yes, it will continue. No, you won't get a lot of it. The Stormlight Archive will not be about the story behind the story, though someday I will write a book series about that. There are basically two large epics in the greater sequence of books I'm writing, and the Stormlight Archive is one of them. There is another one, and both of the large epics will have certain amounts of influence from Hoid. Other books will be written that will not have nearly as much influence. But I'll go ahead and say that Hoid's origin story is not in the Stormlight Archive. That's not what this series is about.
