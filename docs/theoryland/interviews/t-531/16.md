# [Interview #531: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: New Brandon Sanderson Interview, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=531#16)

#### Patrick

As the overall story arc is nearing its conclusion and a panoply of plotlines are approaching their culmination in
*Towers of Midnight*
, is there added pressure for you as
*A Memory of Light*
draws nearer and you need to close the show with a bang?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. You phrased that very well. I don't know if I can add anything more to that; you've got it. Now, the nice thing to keep in mind is that I don't have to write the ending. The BANG has already been written by Robert Jordan, and as a reader I found it extremely satisfying when I reached it. And so I feel very confident that the ending of the next book is going to be what everyone has been hoping for and wantingâ€”without being exactly what they expect. I think the ending that Robert Jordan is just wonderful. So at least I don't have to worry about that. But I do have to make this the best book that I can possibly write, and it's going to be a challenge. It's part of why I've decided that I have to slow down, as I said earlier, and just take my time on this one.
