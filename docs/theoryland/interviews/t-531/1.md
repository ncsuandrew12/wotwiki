) just a few weeks from being released, the folks at Tor Books inquired if I'd like to be the first one to get a crack at a Q&A with Brandon Sanderson to help promote the book. And since our WoT interview last spring turned out to be quite interesting, I decided to invite the gang for an encore!

Once again, my partners in crime were Adam (

), Ken (

), and Larry (

). And once more, I have a feeling we came up with something particularly good, if I may say so myself!

Special thanks go out to Brandon Sanderson for taking some time off his busy schedule to indulge us! And thanks to Justin for extending the invitation!

Enjoy!
