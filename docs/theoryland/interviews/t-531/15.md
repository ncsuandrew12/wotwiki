# [Interview #531: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: New Brandon Sanderson Interview, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=531#15)

#### Patrick

Okay, you knew they were coming! Did you really think you could get away with not answering at least one WoT question!?! And no, you can't RAFO us!
*The Gathering Storm*
impressed through its tight thematic focus on Rand and Egwene's tribulations and what they went through to resolve them. You've said that
*Towers of Midnight*
has been a tougher book to write due to its more expansive nature and larger cast. For you (and avoiding spoilers!), what was the biggest difference in the writing process for the two books, and the biggest challenge?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The biggest difference is that in
*The Gathering Storm*
I took two tight narratives and built them both to an enormous crescendo. In
*Towers of Midnight*
I had to make each chapter have more of an impact. In
*Towers of Midnight*
there are these amazing scenes, chapter after chapter—BAM BAM BAM, this incredible scene you've been waiting for, this other incredible scene you've been waiting for, this majestic scene you've been waiting for—but at the same time we're showing the scope around the world. Now, the book has one of those tight narratives that builds to an enormous crescendo that I'm very pleased with. But a lot of the rest of the book is this sequence and that sequence and this sequence and that sequence, so it's a very different book. Book twelve felt more like books one, two, and three to me. Book thirteen feels like books four, five, and six. This expands the vision and goes back to places we've been before.

It was a wonderful process. I actually think that
*Towers of Midnight*
is a better Wheel of Time book than
*The Gathering Storm*
was. But it made for a much more difficult write, because tying all of these elements together was a big challenge. Tying two narratives together is challenging, but then suddenly when you have eight narratives and have to make sure that they thematically work together, and all of that, is that much more of a challenge.

We'll see what readers think. In these books I am particularly beholden to the Wheel of Time fans. I feel these books are for them. So I won't really know if I've been successful until they read it. But I feel very pleased with the book.
