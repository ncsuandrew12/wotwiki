# [Interview #174: COT Signing Report - Robert Mee, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=174#1)

#### Robert Mee

Hey all,

The signing at Bailey's Crossroads in Northern Virgina was awesome. Well over 200 people came out to meet the man whose series we all very much enjoy debating/arguing/considering/contemplating. Again, RJ did the whole thing about pronunciation and told us all that someone somewhere had puzzled out the Asmodean mystery... but wouldn't tell us the sleuth or the solution.

Most people seemed to be uninterested in asking questions about WoT while he signed... though there were some interesting discussions in line. I did manage to get one question in toward the end.
