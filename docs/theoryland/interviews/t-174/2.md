# [Interview #174: COT Signing Report - Robert Mee, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=174#2)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked if we had actually seen Mesaana's alter ego in the White Tower and he answered "Yes." I think he was waiting for me to say "Who?" so he could respond "RAFO"..... but I didn't. Granted, it's not much, but it's a bit of evidence that Mesaana is not some random Aes Sedai in the Tower... we have seen her.
