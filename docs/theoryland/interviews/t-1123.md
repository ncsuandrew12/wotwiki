Was Hoid offered one of the Shards we know about.

You know, I can't remember which Shard I've shown you, Wait, no I haven't shown you that one.

Cool, do all shards have a number they're associated with?

Some do, (Most? Some?) don't. (I didn't get exact wording on this one.

It depends on how strong they are.
