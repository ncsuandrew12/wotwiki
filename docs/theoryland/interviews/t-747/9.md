# [Interview #747, Entry #9]: Writing for Charity Signing](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=747#9)

#### Zas

A question that has it’s roots in Dragonsteel. When Ruin changes words, is he actually changing words,or is he changing what people see?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Did we canonize this question Peter? I’m pretty sure we did. I thought we answered this one already.(It’s not in our records if he did)

Let’s just say that most of the time, Ruin was searching for a place to transition, where he could change what was being trans-transcribed. Or what was being heard, or what was being said.

#### ZAS

That’s pretty interesting.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

So the easiest time for him is when a scribe is writing in a new book, he’s copying a new book down, and he just pops in and changes the words.

#### ZAS

Okay. That makes sense.
