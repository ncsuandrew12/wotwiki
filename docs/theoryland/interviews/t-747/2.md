#### Zas

This one is from Terez, about WoT. It says "Does Moridin have anything to do with the Knife of Dreams?"

#### Peter

She thinks that his name "Tedronai" translates into Knife of Dreams in WoT.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

(slightly surprised) Oh. If that is the case Terez,which it very well may be, I don’t know. I don’t know. That’s mostly because I don’t do anything with the Old Tongue- I let Alan handle it, because he’s so good at it, I pretty much just refer to him. The only thing I tried to name on my own was Perrin’s hammer. And even that, he had to fix a few little things to make it work right.

So I won’t kill that theory, but I can’t confirm it either.
