#### Zas

There is a debate on what to call Shallan's Symbols, so we don't have such an ambiguous term for it .

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Symbolhead?

#### ZAS

Yeah, the Symbolhead, Shallanspren,

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

(laughter)

#### ZAS

We don't really know what to call them.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Do I want to canonize this yet?

#### ZAS

You don't have to canonize it yet.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I don't know if I want to canonize it yet. But I will say this. They are spren, that should be pretty obvious. They are the spren connected to what Shallan is capable of doing. But I donâ€™t know if I want to canonize it yet. Truthspren is as good a name as any, and I would suggest you use that until further notice.
