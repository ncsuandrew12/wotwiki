#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, give me another one. We’re way over five now.

#### ZAS

True. (Although it’s not! Haha!) Why did OreSeur signup for Kelsier’s plan. Was he forced to because of his contract? Or did he actually want to do it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

All kandra want to be back in the Homeland. That said, OreSeur, he as a kandra, likes challenges, and was a real method kandra, a lot of them are, but he truly was. And you can see that in him. So for him, the contract and the role he plays.

#### ZAS

Are more important than what he actually wants.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah. Even though he had spent all this time doing this stuff. So he was part of it, but for him, his role was being this person. If I may.

#### ZAS

That’s interesting.
