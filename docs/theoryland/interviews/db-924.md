Pat Rothfuss's
[Worldbuilders](http://teamheifer.heifer.org/worldbuilders2012)
charity drive runs until midnight tonight Central time. Today is the last chance to donate this year, with a good chance to win a cool donated book.
[The latest batch](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2013/01/even-yet-more-author-donated-books/)
includes a signed leatherbound copy of my novella
*Legion*
. By the way, last week's
[*The Gathering Storm*
auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Gathering-Storm-set-Hardcover-1st-1st-signed-by-Brandon-Sanderson-2-pins-/181060571127?pt=US_Fiction_Books&hash=item2a280d0ff7)
went for $300. This week's
*Legion*
just goes into the general pool of prizes for people who donate $10 on the
[Heifer International](http://teamheifer.heifer.org/worldbuilders2012)
page. (Each additional $10 donation gets you another ticket in the drawing.)

## Entry #3

*A Memory of Light*
did indeed
[hit #1 on the
*New York Times*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/01/a-memory-of-light-debuts-at-1-on-the-new-york-times-bestseller-list)
bestseller list for hardcover fiction. It also hit #1 on the
*USA Today*
list, which is much harder, since the
*USA Today*
list covers all print books, whatever the format, whether fiction or nonfiction. That's the sendoff we had hoped to be able to deliver for Robert Jordan's legacy. I'm honored to have been involved. Thank you to all the readers who made this a reality, and I hope you're enjoying the book.
