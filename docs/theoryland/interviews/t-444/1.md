# [Interview #444, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Sam Weller's signing and my MileHiCon schedule](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=444#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yesterday evening I went up to
[Sam Weller's](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/57/THE-GATHERING-STORM-Release-Events#item4)
and signed and numbered 500 copies of
*The Gathering Storm*
for their virtual release day signing. (My hand hurts. Now I'm really looking forward to signing 1,000 books within 24 hours next week.) Anyway, a grand total of seven of those books were not already spoken for through preorders. If you call Sam Weller's this instant you might be able to snag one of the remaining copies (assuming they haven't already been claimed since yesterday). Now, I will be signing there again on
[November 2nd](http://brandonsanderson.com/events)
as a regular stop on the book tour, so if you can't make any of the tour dates and want a signed book, calling Sam Weller's is still a good optionâ€”anything signed there after yesterday just won't have a number and won't get shipped out until a week after the book is released. Which is just seven days away, folks.
