# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#13)

#### Lance Alvein

How was the Fjordell Empire not aware of the existence of the Rose Empire during the time of Elantris?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

The connection between the two will be explained in future Elantris books, but a quick answer is this:
Fjordell was aware of the Rose Empire, but doesn't consider the location to be holy, so they didn't really care that much about it. There is also no easy natural way to travel between the two. If you remember, Shai did run into the Fjordell ambassador.
