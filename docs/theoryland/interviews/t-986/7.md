# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#7)

#### Lance Alvein

Can you confirm if the scene with Taln at the end of Way of Kings is entirely in Hoid's perspective? There was some discussion that it might not be, since Taln's honourblade was called a shardblade.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

That entire scene is in Hoid's POV, and the reason for it being called a shardblade is because honourblades are shardblades.
