# [Interview #986, Entry #20]: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#20)

#### Lance Alvein

You mentioned in the forum QA that Liar of Partinel was scrapped - does this mean that Hoid's backstory will no longer be told?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

There are still plans to do Hoid's backstory, all that the comment about the book being scrapped meant is that when it comes time to write it, the current draft will be tossed away and it will be written fresh - similar to how Way of Kings was done.

#### Footnote

Brandon has said that he now wants to tell Hoid's story from a first person perspective.
