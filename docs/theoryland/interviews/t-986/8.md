#### Lance Alvein

Something that's been a bit of a thing on the chatroom for a while - Since there are Spren of everything on Roshar, is it possible that there is such a thing as a "squeespren"?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

They do exist, however, they would be called by a different name on Roshar.
