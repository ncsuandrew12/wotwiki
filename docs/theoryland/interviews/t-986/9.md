# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#9)

#### Lance Alvein

The deleted prologue with Hoid in it - is there any chance of that being put online?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It will be online, and it will probably be bundled with the ebook version as well.

#### Footnote

[Peter has said](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/3641-emperors-soul-deleted-scene/#entry57940)
that this could be released at any time, but he'd prefer to do it after September 1, 2013.
