# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#12)

#### Lance Alvein

Meteorites are mentioned as "souls of dead gods". Do they have any relation to the Splinters of Devotion and Dominion and their physical aspects (like lerasium)?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

"Literally no". When asked if there is a connection to the splinters at all, I got another RAFO.
