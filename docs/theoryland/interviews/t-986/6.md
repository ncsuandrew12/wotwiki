# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#6)

#### Lance Alvein

The creatures on the inside cover of Way of Kings - we've had various discussion about what they actually are, and some people are calling them Crabwasps and other Dragonwasps. Can you tell me anything else about them, and can you pick one of the two for us to use?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

The decision for that image was made near the last minute to have Isaac make the image. It is an important symbol, and will be mentioned in detail in later books. While neither name is correct, they both could work until the official name is revealed (Brandon wouldn't pick one over the other).
