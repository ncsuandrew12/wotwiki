# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#22)

#### Lance Alvein

How about the general number of years Warbreaker is from HoA and AoL/WoK?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

RAFO - the reason that timeline questions are being RAFOed right now is because the final times are still not 100% solid, and Brandon said that he doesn't want to give us a time and then have it change around again (like what happened to AoL being moved to the same time as WoK instead of being a bit earlier), so he won't answer any timeline questions until after he has the final timeline correct in his own system.
