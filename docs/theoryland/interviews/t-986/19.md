# [Interview #986, Entry #19]: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#19)

#### Lance Alvein

Is Shadows of Silence a cosmere story?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It is cosmere, but takes place on an unimportant side planet that doesn't have anything interesting going on there. Hoid is not in the story.

#### Footnote

The story's correct name is Silence For Shadows in the Forests of Hell. In addition to that
[Peter is unsure](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/2848-shadows-for-silence-in-the-forests-of-hell/?p=48152#entry48152)
whether or not Hoid makes a brief appearance.
