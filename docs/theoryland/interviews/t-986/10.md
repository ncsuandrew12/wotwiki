# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#10)

#### Lance Alvein

Can you tell us the timeline of TES in comparison to Elantris?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It happens shortly after Elantris (I believe that this meant shortly in comparison to the other novels, but not a specific # of years)
