# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#17)

#### Lance Alvein

You said to not travel to Shadesmar on Sel. Is this a consequence of Odium Splintering Aona and Skai?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It is indirectly related to the splintering. There is a clue to why it is dangerous in Way of Kings.
