# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986#11)

#### Lance Alvein

Is Sel realmatically knowledgeable by this point, or is it specific to forgery?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Sel is the most realmatically knowledgeable of any of the shardworlds, but much of the knowledge demonstrated in the book is directly related to forgery - it's tied to the theological aspects of forgery more than anything else.
