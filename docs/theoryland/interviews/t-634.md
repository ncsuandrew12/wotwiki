#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I'm off on my tour.
*The Alloy of Law*
release party was a blast, even though the bookstore was a little light on copies. We managed to get everyone a book, I think. So huzzah, and forward.

One of the things I announced yesterday on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook
was another
[Great Hunt](http://brandonsanderson.com/thegreathunt)
to coincide with my tour. If you aren't familiar with it, this is a
[concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hunt)
from the Wheel of Time books which I (very loosely) adapted into a scavenger hunt to hold while on tour. I leave codes hidden around the world for Wheel of Time fans to locate, and they collectively input them into a
[web page](http://brandonsanderson.com/thegreathunt)
which slowly unlocks text for everyone to see. (You can read a recap of last year's Great Hunt
[here](https://docs.google.com/View?docID=dcjspjqg_881z2xd56fn&revision=_latest)
.)](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)

I have some thirty codes to reveal, hide, or otherwise give out while on tour this time. I may hide some inside books in certain bookstores. I might give them to individuals (like Tor employees) for safe keeping, and require you to figure out who they are. Or, perhaps, you might have to do something else. Whatever strikes me.

Before we go farther, however, some ground rules:

> 1. The codes are inside envelopes this year, with a label requesting that a bookstore employee NOT open the envelope and read the code over the phone. I'll probably prepare the bookstore employees for what is coming. You are required to fetch the codes yourself, or at least send someone you personally know to get the code. I don't want you bothering employees of any store—whether it be bookstores or someone from a store next door—to do the work for you. They aren't being paid to fetch codes. If you know someone in the area and can send them, go for it. Avoid bothering strangers.
>
> 2. All but four of the codes need to be entered in order to reveal the secret, but each one inputted will reveal small bits. This is a collective endeavor. Share information, work together. Once you find a code, input it on
> [this page](http://brandonsanderson.com/thegreathunt)
> . Everyone else, feel free to watch the page and try to figure out what the secret is going to be as more is revealed.
>
> 3. It is okay to try to guess codes. They have something in common. In a way, they are some fun information themselves.
>
> 4. If you want to get involved, both

> (among others) are likely to have threads where you can post, participate, and see what codes have been found and what others have been tried. You can follow the hunt's progress by searching for the

> .

Now, as to the secret itself, I feel I should manage some expectations. Last year, we revealed a chapter from the upcoming Wheel of Time book. There are no chapters that are ready this time; they're all in first-draft stage. So the secret this time will not be something quite so earth-shattering. (Sorry.)

I still think it is cool, though it is more in the 'cool curiosity' category rather than the 'sneak peek' category. This is something that was written by Robert Jordan himself, and is taken directly from his notes. People have frequently asked us to show some of the notes, and Harriet agreed to let us show you this chunk. It is illustrative of the kinds of things you'd find in the notes themselves.

So, swear the hunter's oath and get to it! Let's have some fun. I plan to give away some of these in each city I visit, so UK Wheel of Time fans, you should have plenty of opportunities this year to help out.

Best,

Brandon
