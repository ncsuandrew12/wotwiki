#### Question

Will everything eventually be resolved?

#### Robert Jordan

All major threads will be resolved. Many of the secondary and tertiary threads will be resolved. He will leave holes because he wants to leave a world alive and kicking, not stored dust free under a bell jar. As late as the final scene he will leave a medium-sized "hook" that will have us thinking, "he's going to do a sequel!" but it's not going to happen.
