# [Interview #195: ComicCon Reports, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=195#10)

#### Robert Jordan

He wrote his Conan books about the man as a late teen, early twenties, because that was one of the few parts of his life where there was a gap in previous books and because he wanted to explore Conan's relationships with women. If you've read any of RJ's Conan books, Conan is as clueless and frustrated about understanding women as Rand, Perrin and Mat!
