#### Question

Why do you seize
*saidin*
but surrender to
*saidar*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Men's and women's brains are physically different so it makes sense that handling the One Power should be different for them. Seizing
*saidin*
is like surfing the mountain slopes amid in a firestorm. Opening oneself to
*saidar*
is much like judo.
