#### Question

There is some confusion in the books about the relative strengths of the Forsaken. Can you rank order them?

#### Robert Jordan

No. The confusion is intentional. The only information on their strengths is rumor and story held over from the Age of Legends and personal opinions of the Forsaken themselves, hardly an unbiased source! The hierarchy of the Forsaken is complex and fluid, not reflecting any direct measure of strength. Also, remember that different channelers have different Talents.
