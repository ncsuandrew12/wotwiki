Randland maps—He insists it was not inspired by the Middle Earth map. He wrote
*The Eye of the World*
with no illustrations but Tom Doherty insisted on a map. RJ sketched out his mental image, placing the nations where he envisaged them. He sent the sketch to a friend, John M. Ford, who did the black and white map from
*The Eye of the World*
. Tom Canty did the color version used for the endpapers. A similar story for the city maps—when really needed, he did a rough sketch and passed it on to another friend, Ellisa Mitchell.
