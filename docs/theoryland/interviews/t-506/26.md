# [Interview #506, Entry #26]: JordanCon 2010 Q&A Report - Terez](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=506#26)

#### Ted Herman

How in the world did Lanfear survive that gigantic explosion that was depicted in the
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Terez

[I don't remember what she said! WSB? I think Tam was talking to me about something, but I seem to remember that question getting fielded to the floor.]

#### Ted Herman

Maria didn't even say RAFO. That was put out for discussion, which I am fine with. Some thought she wasn't physically there, or used the shield weave that Rand used in
*The Path of Daggers*
.

#### Matt Hatch

Is Lanfear the only surviving person that is aware of how the Bore was created?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know. Mesaana or Demandred might know.
