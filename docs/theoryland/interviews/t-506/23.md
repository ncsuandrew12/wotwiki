#### Ishara

Did Mierin drill the Bore out of curiosity, or out of some malevolent desire?

#### Maria Simons

Mierin was kind of greedy. I don't think it was a malevolent intent, but it wasn't all pure and nice.

#### Ishara

Did her drilling of the Bore remove her choice [about becoming a Darkfriend] in any way?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know.
