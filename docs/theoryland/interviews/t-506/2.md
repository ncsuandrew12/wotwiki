# [Interview #506: JordanCon 2010 Q&A Report - Terez, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=506#2)

#### Terez

When I was in line, I asked Brandon and Harriet (mostly Harriet, since she was signing my books) if the Andoran royal line is descended from Rand's Aiel line (see
[this post](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=94394#poststop)
) [by Rhea, the Aiel daughter of Adan who was kidnapped along with several other women in Rand's Rhuidean visions]:

#### Harriet McDougal

I got a lovely smile from Harriet that told me she was pleased that someone had finally figured that out, and she said that she believes I am exactly right about that. She was a little sketchy on the details, though, and so was Brandon, so Brandon said it was essentially a MAFO. So I talked to Maria after that session, and she was taking a break so I didn't want to ask her about it just then, so I asked her if I could message her about it, and the other MAFO we got today, and she said yes, so I will hopefully be hearing more about that soon. Brandon asked me not to put that one in the interview database until I hear from Maria about it.

Oops. I really have been terribly slow with these. I canâ€™t find anything that says yea or nay on this one.

#### Terez

I think that Brandon got the impression Harriet was leaping on it too quick, and that's quite possible; I might have read too much into it.
