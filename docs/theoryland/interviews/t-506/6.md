# [Interview #506: JordanCon 2010 Q&A Report - Terez, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=506#6)

#### Question

Are we going to get to see the other two prequels that RJ had planned on writing?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

We're finishing the WoT first. And...um...that's it.

#### Terez

(I don't think she was saying that there would not be any prequels...just that this is all she had to say on the subject currently.)
