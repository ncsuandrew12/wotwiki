#### Question

You and Alan have worked on WoT for many years. Beyond that are there any other projects that you are looking at editing beyond the WoT?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The encyclopedia is sort of beyond the WoT, sort of a 'fifth wheel' (laughter), and I'll definitely be looking forward to that. Meanwhile there's a project with a fellow Charlestonian that I'm eager to get off the ground. (more from audio)

#### Alan Romanczuk

We have a session specifically on the encyclopedia tomorrow. After WoT I think I look forward to working more in my garden and to continuing my career as a professional cabaret singer.
