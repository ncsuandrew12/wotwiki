# [Interview #506: JordanCon 2010 Q&A Report - Terez, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=506#16)

#### Matt Hatch

Is the Horn an object of the Power?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO, but I will tell you something about the Horn. People always ask why the inscription on the Horn is in the Old Tongue, if it's so old. It was added in the Age of Legends.

#### Terez

It should also be noted that, when a panel moderator asked the audience if we wanted to see the Heroes of the Horn come back before the end, Maria raised her hand high.
