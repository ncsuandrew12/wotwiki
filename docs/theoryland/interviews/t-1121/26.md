# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#26)

#### Question

What is Sylâ€™s favorite form?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Syl is kind of ephemeral. So her favorite changes quite often. I would say, she probably likes being in human form the most because she gets the best reaction from the people around her that she is interacting with. But that has not always been the case. But she is responding to those around her.

#### Question

I hope to see more of her and Kaladin in the future.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They have some fun times.
