# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#21)

#### Question

Can you clarify the structure you are planning for Dragonsteel? For some reason I have stuck in my head seven.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It was originally going to be seven. Right now I have cut out so much of the books, it will probably be at three.
