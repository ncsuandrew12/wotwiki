# [Interview #1121, Entry #11]: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#11)

#### Question

When will we find out what the Nightwatcher looks like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dalinar in the past visited the Nightwather. The next book , Oathbringer, will be visiting important parts of his [past]. You can postulate that one of those important events might be his visit to the Nightwatcher. I would really like to see a NW costume.
