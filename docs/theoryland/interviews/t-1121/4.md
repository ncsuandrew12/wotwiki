What happened to the ministries?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Ministries, being a legacy at the time of the Lord Ruler’s rule, there are trappings of them left but they don’t use any of the same names or anything like that. There are cities you can go to where there are more echoes of that. In Elendel you can barely even find the trappings anymore, but you can find some of them. You can’t go in there and find the Ministry of this-and-that, because it was run by Kelsier’s crew, most of that did not make the transition. Though there were notable Obligators who made it through and so they have left their mark. You have to search for it though.
