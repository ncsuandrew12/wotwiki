#### Ted

Does Lift's metabolic waste include crem?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughs] That’s an excellent question. I’m not going to answer that, but it’s an excellent question.

#### Ted

Wow, you’re RAFOing that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You got a laugh. I didn’t say RAFO, I said I’m not going to answer that, which could be considered two different answers.
