# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#9)

#### Question

I wanted to know your stance on gods were? If you have a message about god.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really. What I’m fascinated by ends up in the books. I am fascinated by religions. But even in something like the SA, I still don’t necessarily want there to be a definitive answer. There are god (lower case) gods. Weather there is a GOD (capital case), is still, in my opinion left to the interpretation of the reader. I’m not trying to say anything specific. I’m trying to say what the different characters say. Does that make since? Jashnah doesn’t speak my belief, but neither does Dalinar. They speak their belief, and I respect their belief the best I can. It’s more trying to be true to the characters.
