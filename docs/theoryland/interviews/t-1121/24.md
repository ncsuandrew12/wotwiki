# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#24)

#### Question

Have Hoid and Sazed (as Harmony) interacted?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uhm… yes, that has happened.

#### Question

Was it meaningful?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid considers everything meaningful. [laughter]

#### Question

Would Sazed consider it meaningful?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sazed considers every individual meaningful. [more laughter from fans]

#### Question

Are we ever going to get an official Cosmere timeline.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Were getting really close to releasing it. I’m not sure when we will. The real trick is now that we are locking down White Sand it is close. The novel wasn’t canon, but once it’s out we will be real close to locking everything down. The trick is where is it? Like Sixth of the Dusk, we’re not sure exactly where it is.

#### Question

So is it actually canon that MB:Era 2 takes place between SA first & second half?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well I haven’t written second half so it depend on when I take a break. Maybe it takes place after 5, maybe after 7. We’ll just see how it goes when I get there. The timing there is a little more tight.

#### Question

So they are much closer in the timeline.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Exactly. So that’s why I have to be a little more doggy on those. Mostly because they are a similar timeline.
