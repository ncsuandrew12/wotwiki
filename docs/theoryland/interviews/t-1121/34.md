# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#34)

#### Question

Are there any characters that you see yourself more in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a bit of me in every character. There is something very different than me in every character. The something that is and something that is not me, helps make each character. Nobody is me.
The closest we get is my mom claims that Alcatraz speaks in my voice. So she laughs and likes those books the best. He’s way… a super caricature of me.
