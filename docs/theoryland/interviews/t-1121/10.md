#### Question

Does Hoid learn the languages magically? Or is he just a gifted linguist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is learning them magically. He’s decent with languages, but he has to speak as if he were a local in order to pass as he does. And no matter how gifted you are, doing that across multiple tongues, that’s really hard.
