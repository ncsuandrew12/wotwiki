# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#33)

#### Question

There is a scope (scale) of unreliability: some because of … or intent. of intent in unreliable narrator.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid can be very intentionally unreliable. There are not many 3rd person viewpoint Cosmere stories. So when we are in the character’s POV, like Kelsier is unreliable in that he doesn’t go into his plan, which is technically by intent, but more because he’s like “I can’t think about this” than design. It also is him lying to the reader a bit.
