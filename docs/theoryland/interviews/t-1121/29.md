# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#29)

#### Question

Does the size of a piece of metal determine the amount of Feruchemical charge that can be stored in it? So how does it scale, in terms of volume?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does. So Iâ€™ve talked about this before. It does not scale as logically as people would think. There are certain thresholds.
