# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#28)

#### Question

So I know that basically Wax and Wayne are basically 1.5, has it turned into 2?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wish I had called it 1.5. We just have to call it Era 2 now for consistently and clarity sake. If I’d called it 1.5 from the beginning I would have liked that to prevent slips of the tongue myself. If I called the other one Era 2 (meaning 3), I’ve thought of it like that so long it happens. Now we just have to live with it.
