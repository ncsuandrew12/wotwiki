# [Interview #1121: Brandon Sanderson Book Signing at JordanCon 8, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1121#27)

#### Question

I’m a huge Dalinar fan. But are you going to have more of Lift and [Ash?] and some of the interlude characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lift you are going to see the most of in the later books. She’s set up to be one of the main characters in the second 5. I have already written two scenes with her in them, but I haven’t written one with her view point yet. But the Cosmere collection which is on my short list will have a new Lift novella in it and that will have an audio edition.
