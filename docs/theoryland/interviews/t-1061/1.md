We're very pleased to be involved with Brandon on the release of his latest epic,
*Words of Radiance*
, which as we type is Number 1 on the
*New York Times*
Bestsellers lists. (Congratulations!)

He's a very busy man, so we were allowed three exclusive questions as part of his UK blog tour. Here they are, and Brandon's responses.
