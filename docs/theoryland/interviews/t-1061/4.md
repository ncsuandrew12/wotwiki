3. Is the plan still for ten books? How much ahead are you with the overall plan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The plan is still for ten books, which is two arcs of five. The first five are very well plotted and nailed down in my head. The back five, I know the endings of each of those, but I'm not 100% sure on all the elements. Once I finish the first five, I will sit down and create the second outline in much more detail. Because they are divided in my head in such a way that they are two smaller arcs that have a big gap between them, I'm really focused on the first five right now.
