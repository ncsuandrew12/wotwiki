# [Interview #986: Hal-Con Report - Lance Alvein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=986)

## Summary

- Date: 2012-10-30

- Type: Paraphrased

- Location: Halifax, NS

- Reporter: Lance Alvein

## [Entry #1](./t-986/1)

#### Lance Alvein

The majority of these questions and answers are paraphrased, as I wasn't able to record them, and I wasn't able to write everything down exactly as it was said. If the answer was a partial evasion, I did make sure to make special note of it, so those answers should be as said.

## [Entry #2](./t-986/2)

#### Lance Alvein

Does the rate of feruchemical storage of an attribute affect the total amount stored in a metalmind?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It was not intended to be.

## [Entry #3](./t-986/3)

#### Lance Alvein

Does the loss during the withdrawal of large amounts of attribute depend on the rate of original storage?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

No

## [Entry #4](./t-986/4)

#### Lance Alvein

You've said that "The Pits of Hathsin were crafted by Preservation as a place to hide the chunk of Ruin's body that he had stolen away." How does one Shard steal a portion of another Shard and create a Physical outlet for it, like the Pits were for Ruin's power?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It has to do with clash between the two shards power. When pressed, he then said that it was "kind of" like splintering

## [Entry #5](./t-986/5)

#### Lance Alvein

How are people with two different eye colours treated on Roshar?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

RAFO - this will be explored in one of Shallan's flashback sequences in Stormlight 2, and is already written.

## [Entry #6](./t-986/6)

#### Lance Alvein

The creatures on the inside cover of Way of Kings - we've had various discussion about what they actually are, and some people are calling them Crabwasps and other Dragonwasps. Can you tell me anything else about them, and can you pick one of the two for us to use?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

The decision for that image was made near the last minute to have Isaac make the image. It is an important symbol, and will be mentioned in detail in later books. While neither name is correct, they both could work until the official name is revealed (Brandon wouldn't pick one over the other).

## [Entry #7](./t-986/7)

#### Lance Alvein

Can you confirm if the scene with Taln at the end of Way of Kings is entirely in Hoid's perspective? There was some discussion that it might not be, since Taln's honourblade was called a shardblade.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

That entire scene is in Hoid's POV, and the reason for it being called a shardblade is because honourblades are shardblades.

## [Entry #8](./t-986/8)

#### Lance Alvein

Something that's been a bit of a thing on the chatroom for a while - Since there are Spren of everything on Roshar, is it possible that there is such a thing as a "squeespren"?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

They do exist, however, they would be called by a different name on Roshar.

## [Entry #9](./t-986/9)

#### Lance Alvein

The deleted prologue with Hoid in it - is there any chance of that being put online?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It will be online, and it will probably be bundled with the ebook version as well.

#### Footnote

[Peter has said](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/3641-emperors-soul-deleted-scene/#entry57940)
that this could be released at any time, but he'd prefer to do it after September 1, 2013.

## [Entry #10](./t-986/10)

#### Lance Alvein

Can you tell us the timeline of TES in comparison to Elantris?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It happens shortly after Elantris (I believe that this meant shortly in comparison to the other novels, but not a specific # of years)

## [Entry #11](./t-986/11)

#### Lance Alvein

Is Sel realmatically knowledgeable by this point, or is it specific to forgery?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Sel is the most realmatically knowledgeable of any of the shardworlds, but much of the knowledge demonstrated in the book is directly related to forgery - it's tied to the theological aspects of forgery more than anything else.

## [Entry #12](./t-986/12)

#### Lance Alvein

Meteorites are mentioned as "souls of dead gods". Do they have any relation to the Splinters of Devotion and Dominion and their physical aspects (like lerasium)?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

"Literally no". When asked if there is a connection to the splinters at all, I got another RAFO.

## [Entry #13](./t-986/13)

#### Lance Alvein

How was the Fjordell Empire not aware of the existence of the Rose Empire during the time of Elantris?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

The connection between the two will be explained in future Elantris books, but a quick answer is this:
Fjordell was aware of the Rose Empire, but doesn't consider the location to be holy, so they didn't really care that much about it. There is also no easy natural way to travel between the two. If you remember, Shai did run into the Fjordell ambassador.

## [Entry #14](./t-986/14)

#### Lance Alvein

Do Ralkalest and Soulstone have any connection to the two shards?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

RAFO

## [Entry #15](./t-986/15)

#### Lance Alvein

How were the MaiPon and Jindoeese people separated?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

This is something that will be discussed in future Elantris books eventually.

## [Entry #16](./t-986/16)

#### Lance Alvein

Is a person's Breath the entirety of that person's Spiritual Aspect?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

No

## [Entry #17](./t-986/17)

#### Lance Alvein

You said to not travel to Shadesmar on Sel. Is this a consequence of Odium Splintering Aona and Skai?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It is indirectly related to the splintering. There is a clue to why it is dangerous in Way of Kings.

## [Entry #18](./t-986/18)

#### Lance Alvein

Is Demoux Atium compounding to achieve his long life?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

RAFO

## [Entry #19](./t-986/19)

#### Lance Alvein

Is Shadows of Silence a cosmere story?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

It is cosmere, but takes place on an unimportant side planet that doesn't have anything interesting going on there. Hoid is not in the story.

#### Footnote

The story's correct name is Silence For Shadows in the Forests of Hell. In addition to that
[Peter is unsure](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/2848-shadows-for-silence-in-the-forests-of-hell/?p=48152#entry48152)
whether or not Hoid makes a brief appearance.

## [Entry #20](./t-986/20)

#### Lance Alvein

You mentioned in the forum QA that Liar of Partinel was scrapped - does this mean that Hoid's backstory will no longer be told?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

There are still plans to do Hoid's backstory, all that the comment about the book being scrapped meant is that when it comes time to write it, the current draft will be tossed away and it will be written fresh - similar to how Way of Kings was done.

#### Footnote

Brandon has said that he now wants to tell Hoid's story from a first person perspective.

## [Entry #21](./t-986/21)

#### Lance Alvein

Can you give us an idea when the Prelude to Stormlight Archive is with respect to Elantris?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

RAFO

## [Entry #22](./t-986/22)

#### Lance Alvein

How about the general number of years Warbreaker is from HoA and AoL/WoK?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

RAFO - the reason that timeline questions are being RAFOed right now is because the final times are still not 100% solid, and Brandon said that he doesn't want to give us a time and then have it change around again (like what happened to AoL being moved to the same time as WoK instead of being a bit earlier), so he won't answer any timeline questions until after he has the final timeline correct in his own system.
