# [Interview #879: AMOL Signing Report - Jonrox, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=879#4)

#### Jonrox

My take: looks like Shaidar Haran is most likely candidate for Cadsuane's box. I asked "who" and his answers didn't even identify it as a person (he didn't say "someone removed the weaves")

Also, looks like I was right about him forgetting about Roedran/Murandians after the Field of Merrilor.

I recorded the Q & A, but I haven't looked to see if it's of a quality worth uploading, since I wasn't aiming my phone at him or anything in particular. I might try to transcribe the session, though, unless the Memory Keeper posts first.
