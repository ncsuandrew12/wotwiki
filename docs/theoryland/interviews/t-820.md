## [Entry #1](./t-820/1)

#### Kean

So that's what your question wasâ€”I didn't hear it clearly.

#### Footnote

This comment is in reference to
[Dave Rothgery's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=821)
from the same signing. The question was about the corruption of the Ways.

## [Entry #2](./t-820/2)

#### Robert Jordan

What Jordan said, specifically, btw, was this:

Someone figured out who killed Asmodean. Thus, it is possible to do so with the clues provided, and he doesn't feel the need to provide more. Further, he refused to in any way indicate who the person with the correct answer is or how to get in touch with said person.

## [Entry #3](./t-820/3)

#### Kean

And I agree, Dave, the questions were pretty useless.
