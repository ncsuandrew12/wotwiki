## [Entry #1](./t-226/1)

#### Robert Mee

Alright, so here it is...

The signing in Bailey's Crossroads went well, about 96 attendees (a LOT less than last time)... and RJ looked good. Definitely lost weight.

## [Entry #2](./t-226/2)

#### Robert Jordan

He started out talking a little bit about his writing, mentioned that he was considering two or three "outrigger" novels... written in WoTverse, but apart from the main thrust of the story (and not including the prequels).

## [Entry #3](./t-226/3)

#### Robert Jordan

In regards to Asmodean, if it seems logical to have a character come forward in the twelfth book and claim the murder, he'll write that. If not we have to wait until the release of the PAPERBACK of book twelve to find out.

## [Entry #4](./t-226/4)

#### Robert Mee

RJ then proceeded to sign some books (he was stopped right after my friend) and was dragged back to do a Q&A before signing the rest. I actually met a guy named Shawn who was as much into the books as I was and we passed information back and forth, so some of this information is thanks to him, too.

## [Entry #5](./t-226/5)

#### Robert Jordan

*Stedding*
: Neither the One Power NOR the True Power will work in a
*stedding*
.

#### Robert Mee

Did not get a chance to ask about whether Far Madding =
*stedding*
.

## [Entry #6](./t-226/6)

#### Robert Jordan

Someone asked about using the Oath Rod or the Three Arches for Accepted testing in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, and RJ said that they would not work the same way.

## [Entry #7](./t-226/7)

#### Robert Jordan

When the Blight receded in
*The Eye of the World*
, the plants actually healed (new plants didn't immediately appear from elsewhere).... minor detail, but good to know.

## [Entry #8](./t-226/8)

#### Question

Siuan and Leane being stilled again and Healed by a male to full strength...

#### Robert Jordan

"RAFO, because I might decide to use that as a plot device!" (That got a few chuckles).

## [Entry #9](./t-226/9)

#### Robert Jordan

The Book of Translation (Ogier thing) was RAFO'd when asked if it was a
*ter'angreal*
or a dictionary/map.

## [Entry #10](./t-226/10)

#### Robert Mee

Verin is NOT, nor has she ever been, a librarian of the Thirteenth Depository. I got a DIRECT ANSWER, not a RAFO. My question was "Was Verin a librarian of the Thirteenth Depository?" (To include both past and present).

#### Robert Jordan

The response was "No." ...which I followed up with "So she's just a bit weird and knows a lot?" and that response was "Pretty much."

## [Entry #11](./t-226/11)

#### Robert Mee

And (drumroll)... The question regarding the Gauntleted Fist clutching the three Lightning Bolts...

#### Robert Jordan

At first he thought I was talking about the chapter icon, which he said he has no control over, but referenced something about Trollocs. When I explained that I meant the sigil we'd seen in Tear and on Sammael's throne and Mazrim Taim's (Mazh-rim Ta-eem)'s throne... his response was "Oh! That...I...I'm going to have to tell you to read and find out." Bah!

## [Entry #12](./t-226/12)

#### Robert Mee

So who has the next signing?

Rob
