# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#8)

#### Question

In the early books, when Mat speaks in the Old Tongue without realizing it, he speaks with a certain voice that seems different from when it happens in
*Towers of Midnight*
, why is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The simple answer is that Mat is now getting more comfortable with who he is and the memories in his head, so it's coming out smoother now. Some of the difference is that the earlier books were completely written by Robert Jordan and I can't know what he was thinking at the time he wrote them.

#### Alan Romanczuk

Also, the Old Tongue is constantly shifting and idiomatic. It is very fluid, and certain words can mean more than just one word. There will be a lot more of the Old Tongue in
*A Memory of Light*
and the Encyclopedia. (Old Tongue is one of Alan's specialties!)
