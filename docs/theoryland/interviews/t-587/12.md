# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#12)

#### Question

Why do Mat, Perrin and Rand always stop the swirling colors when they have visions of each other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Their personalities. A piece of them still feel that they are still those small village boys and don't want to be involved. It's the nature of the beast.

#### Maria Simons

And sometimes they see things they really don't want to see!
