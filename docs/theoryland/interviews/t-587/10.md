# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#10)

#### Question

How is it writing from someone else's outline as opposed to your own?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's easier than I thought. I base my outlines off focal points and build backward to what would make that scene happen. RJ would work on scenes he found important and write them first. And so the notes that I was handed were list of important scenes without any connecting material. But in a lot of cases, the very important scenes were either indicated to me or written completely or left with a line or a paragraph or a dictation telling me what to do. And when I built this it fell very naturally into my type of outline. I have complete creative control, so long as I can convince the rest of Team Jordan.
