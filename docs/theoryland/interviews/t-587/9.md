# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#9)

#### Question

Is Padan Fain going to turn out like Gollum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he is not going to be like that. I am aware of the comparisons, and I am trying to distance him from that. The scene in
*Towers of Midnight*
with Padan Fain was originally written differently, and when I submitted it to Harriet she said, "Oh no, he's much crazier than that!" So I changed it accordingly.
