# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#16)

#### Question

Have there been any female
*ta'veren*
?

#### Maria Simons

None in the main series, but they can be. Some people think Egwene may be
*ta'veren*
, but I don't think she is. (A fan pointed out that someone would have seen her as
*ta'veren*
and Maria agreed that she is not.)

#### Alan Romanczuk

The Dragon is always a man.
