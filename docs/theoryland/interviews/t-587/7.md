# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#7)

#### Question

Can Rand still access the True Power since his epiphany?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not going to answer that!

#### Footnote

Brandon said elsewhere that he can
[still sense it](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#155)
, which means he can still use it, and simply chooses not to.
