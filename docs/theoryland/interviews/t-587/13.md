# [Interview #587, Entry #13]: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#13)

#### Question

Do you already have an outline for
*A Memory of Light*
? Is it partially built or do you have to do the whole thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's partially done. I have an outline, but Team Jordan hasn't read it yet. They will in March. I am also going to read through the entire series again before I start the last book.
