#### Question

Did dragons ever exist in the Wheel of Time? Are they actual mythological creatures? (In the Wheel of Time)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The creatures don't exist in life. They know the symbol is a dragon, but they don't know where it came from. Maybe it's one of those things where the symbol remained, but the meaning was lost.
