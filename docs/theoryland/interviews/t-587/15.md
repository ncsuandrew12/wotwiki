# [Interview #587: TOM Signing Report - Sarayne, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=587#15)

#### Question

Where is Bela right now?

#### Maria Simons

The last time we saw her was when Siuan rode her when going to rescue Egewne. She is probably in the Tower stables.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet tossed in an ominous, "She's, of course, communing with the Dark One!" (Joking, of course!)
