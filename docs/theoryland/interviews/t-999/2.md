# [Interview #999: Phoenix ComicCon Report - KakitaOCU, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=999#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He stated straight out that Lanfear had additional plans in motion that can be figured out based on
*A Memory of Light*
that none of the fandom has found yet (or at least not posted). He was asked for specifics and gave a RAFO, then specified he meant that in terms of re-reading
*A Memory of Light*
.

He confirmed that Lanfear's compulsion of Perrin was only in
*A Memory of Light*
and that she didn't like using it and so had not done so in their previous meeting back in the early books.
