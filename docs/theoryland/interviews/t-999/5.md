# [Interview #999: Phoenix ComicCon Report - KakitaOCU, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=999#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He acknowledged why Asmodean's killer was revealed the way it was. Apparently when he got the "Notes" from Harriet there was a sticky note on the top that just said "Graendal killed Asmodean" with no further explanation or notes. So they thought it'd be fun to provide the same type of blank answer to the rest of the community.
