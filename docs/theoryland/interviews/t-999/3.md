# [Interview #999: Phoenix ComicCon Report - KakitaOCU, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=999#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Re: Deaths of major characters. His statement was that Jordan had left ending situations for nearly every character and that, with only two exceptions, if Jordan didn't specify, they had the character live. He confirmed one of those exceptions was Harriet's decision re: Siuan. He did not reveal the other.
