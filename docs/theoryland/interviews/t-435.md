#### Brandon Sanderson

I mentioned these first two points in my
[big update on Thursday](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/57/THE-GATHERING-STORM-Release-Events!)
, but because of a couple emails I've gotten since then I thought I should make them a bit more obvious.

One of the events planned in conjunction with
*The Gathering Storm*
's release on October 27 is a virtual signing. If you're not able to attend
[one of my other upcoming signings](http://brandonsanderson.com/events)
you can still order a signed copy of the book—even internationally. Please
[see item #4 in the update](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/57/THE-GATHERING-STORM-Release-Events!)
.

If you can make it to one of the signings and want to sit down in a small group and talk informally with me (and possibly Harriet, for the select cities where she'll also be attending) ahead of time, Dragonmount has put together a
[Storm Leader application](http://www.dragonmount.com/News/?p=674)
for you to fill out. If you do get picked, Dragonmount also has some tasks for you to do during the signing. For details,
[check out the application](http://www.dragonmount.com/News/?p=674)
. Note: We're expecting very high attendance at the signings in this tour, so the focus will be on getting everyone's books signed—if there are large crowds, there won't be time for readings or a Q&A. It's likely that only Storm Leaders will get the opportunity to talk to me at any length, so if you're a huge fan, this is for you.

In this week's Writing Excuses podcast, debut author
[John Brown](http://johndbrown.com/)
(whose book
[*Servant of a Dark God*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/0765322358/?tag=monkeyslothst-20&linkCode=asn&creativeASIN=0765322358)
comes out from Tor two weeks before
*The Gathering Storm*
—need an epic fantasy to tide you over?) joins us to discuss
[how to avoid making your characters sound just like you](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/09/13/writing-excuses-season-3-episode-16-the-anti-mary-sue-episode/)
. We also put up an
[acceptance speech](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/09/13/writing-excuses-parsec-award-acceptance-speech/)
for the
[Parsec Award](http://parsecawards.com/)
we won at Dragon\*Con, but it's probably better to pretend I didn't just link it. . . .

Finally, in the most recent Mistborn 3 annotation, I discuss
[Clubs' backstory](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/286/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Twenty-Three)
. Give it a look.
