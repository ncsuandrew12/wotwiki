was needed at the Eye of the World.

#### Robert Jordan

He kind of gave me a RAFO. RJ said that he has an idea of what he wants that to have been for, but he's not sure he's going to use it, so he didn't want to give me information and then change his mind later. So all our guesses are correct at the moment!
