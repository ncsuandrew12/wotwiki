# [Interview #69: ACOS Signing Report - Hawk, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=69#1)

#### Hawk

Yeah, I know it wasn't heavily advertised—I just found out about it by dumb luck. It seems that when Barnes and Nobles rounds up the usual suspects to advertise to, it doesn't really include more than their newsletter, and the local News & Disturber.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ read from the same chapter that he did at Balticon—except this time he read the entire chapter, rather than just the part where Mat gets jumped upon by Tylin.

He was remarkably patient with the amount of people there, and even remembered me from BaltiCon. I suspect it has something to do with him signing my books "To Hawk" than anything else.
