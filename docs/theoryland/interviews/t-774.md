## [Entry #1](./t-774/1)

#### Ayyad Azryelle

Back from the signing, it was great! :)
  
He read from my copy of
*Towers of Midnight*
! ^^

The Q&A was spoiler-free...

## [Entry #2](./t-774/2)

#### Ayyad Azryelle

Someone asked how can the Trollocs survive in the Blight? (What do they eat?)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon Sanderson said the Trolloc population had grown so much, there was not enough food for them in the Blight. He said that the Dark side did have gateways but would not say more.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone else asked what was the role of the Prince of Ravens and got a RAFO.

#### Ayyad Azryelle

When he was signing my books, I asked about a couple of spoilery things, such as (from memory):

## [Entry #5](./t-774/5)

#### Ayyad Azryelle

Can people who were forced to become Darkfriends through a 13-13 circle be saved?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he couldn't give an answer, but that the characters from the books would say yes.

## [Entry #6](./t-774/6)

#### Ayyad Azryelle

What Aviendha saw in Rhuidean is something that MUST happen (a fixed point in time?) or COULD happen (anything could happen, it's in flux)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #7](./t-774/7)

#### Ayyad Azryelle

Why do Aviendha's children channel all the time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO (explained in the next book).
