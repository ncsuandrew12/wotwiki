## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#1)

#### Host

Hello, the folks of AOL! I'm Jim JMF, your host for this evening's festivities. Everybody, let's give a big welcome to Robert Jordan! Welcome to AOL Live!

#### Robert Jordan

Hi guys!! Thanks for having me.

#### Host

Robert, are you ready for some questions from the audience?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes I am!

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#2)

#### Question

I heard the name of book 8 in the WOT series is "The Tower of Ravens." Is there any truth to that?

#### Robert Jordan

There is no title for Book 8. Not yet. My working title is "Book 8" and will probably remain that until I am, oh, 2/3 of the way through the book.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#3)

#### Question

I heard that some of your stuff is being republished.
*Fallon*
books, right?

#### Robert Jordan

That's correct. They are historical novels and I think they will appeal both to buffs of history novels, "The American Revolution," "The War Against the Tripoli Pirates," and also readers of what I have heard called "sober romances". The people are certainly full-blooded, shall we say, and there are a number of romances in there.

#### Question

About those historical novels, where do you get the information for those? Personal research?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, and a personal interest in history.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#4)

#### Question

You are truly the master of fantasy Master Jordan. Tolkien is wonderful, but I'm afraid you eclipse him. Although, you do have fifty years of experience on him.

#### Robert Jordan

That sounds like the finest kind of butter to me and if you don't mind, I'll keep one hand on my wallet.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#5)

#### Question

When is Book 8 going to come out?

#### Robert Jordan

Probably in January or February of 1998. I am scheduled to hand it to the publisher in November of 1997. I have slowed down a little bit in order to stay alive to the end of the series. My wife, my publisher and some other people convinced me that I was killing myself maintaining my old work schedule.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#6)

#### Question

How do you feel about women being admitted to The Citadel?

#### Robert Jordan

In the first place, I do wish that the school had been able to remain all male, but the fact is, women are in The Citadel, and as far as I'm concerned, it's time to get on with the business at hand and stop grousing about what's past.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#7)

#### Question

In your future WOT books will we start to see things from the Seanchan perspective?

#### Robert Jordan

It's quite possible, but the only real answer I can give is RAFO.

#### Question

To clarify...what is the RAFO reference to?

#### Robert Jordan

It's an acronym that some people who have been on the net have tossed at me in face to face meetings and I have tossed back at others and RAFO means READ AND FIND OUT.

#### Footnote

There were three
[Seanchan POVs](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=7139#poststop)
in
*The Shadow Rising*
: Suroth, Egeanin, and Almurat Mor (the Seeker investigating Egeanin). Sometimes 'RAFO' means 'read the books that are already published'.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#8)

#### Question

Any suggestions for authors/books to keep us busy while we wait for Book 8?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. Terry Pratchett, Ray Feist, C.S. Freidman, Barry Hughart, Robert Holdstock, Guy Gavriel Kay, and of course there's George R. R. Martin's new book. You ought to go back and read anything by John M. Ford that you can get your hands on.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#9)

#### Question

How do you come up with all the details in your stories,
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, the details of the kingdoms, and the personal histories and all that?

#### Robert Jordan

A lot of hard work.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#10)

#### Question

How long did it take you to plan the Wheel of Time world?

#### Robert Jordan

A very long time. Almost ten years of thinking about it before I began writing. And then four years to write
*The Eye of the World*
. Then roughly 14 months each for the next five books, and about 20 or 21 months for
*A Crown of Swords*
. You see, I have the world planned out, but quite often details are a work in progress.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#11)

#### Question

Considering that schedule, do you spend every waking minute on your books or do you do other things in between that prepare you to write?

#### Robert Jordan

I do other things. I fish, although not nearly as often as I should, just for relaxation purposes, and of course I read. Actually, I have to read. If I don't read someone else before going to bed, I will lie there awake all night thinking about my own work and what I want to do next.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#12)

#### Question

Any chance of seeing the "Wheel of Time" in other media (television, CD-ROM's, etc.)?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't know about TV certainly, but a company called Legend Entertainment is working on a Wheel of Time role playing game that will have both strategic and tactical levels and be able to be played against your own computer or on the Web against other players. I think it should be interesting. I gave them a number of requirements which all boil down in a way to ... it should be impossible to play the same game twice.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#13)

#### Question

Any plans for a book of artwork that depicts your vision of the world in your books?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, in a way. Next October, there will be "An Illustrated Guide to the World of The Wheel of Time". Released by Tor Books. It will have a great deal of information about the back history of the stories and the world. And also, some 80 or 90 full color illustrations including maps of the entire world of the Seanchan Empire, maps of the nations of the Compact of the Ten Nations, and the nations as they existed at the time. As well as pictures of a number of the individuals from the books. In some cases those pictures look exactly as I envision the person. In other cases, the artist and I just couldn't come to a full agreement on what I was trying to describe. All in all, I am very satisfied with the pictures, though.

There will also be about 120-130,000 words of text telling about things like how the White Tower was founded and why the White Tower looks monolithic from the outside and so very fractured from the inside. There will be a good deal of the history of people like Artur Hawkwing and the Amyrlins for the last thousand years or so.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#14)

#### Question

Is Book 8 the end? If not, is there a plan for when the end will be?

#### Robert Jordan

Book 8 is not the end. There will be at least three more books and I am sorry for that. I have known what the last scene of the last book would be for quite a long time, 10 or 12 years at least. I just want to get to it without speeding up my pace.

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#15)

#### Question

How much did your military experience influence your writing?

#### Robert Jordan

Some, I suppose, but I don't know that it had any great influence.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#16)

#### Question

Did you base any of the WOT characters on real life friends, or acquaintances?

#### Robert Jordan

No, with one exception. All of the major female characters have some part of my wife in them.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#17)

#### Question

How much did Tolkien, or even Eddings' Belgariad chronicles influence the WOT series?

#### Robert Jordan

Eddings certainly not at all, and as for Tolkien, only to the degree that (1) he showed that it was possible to write a very large series of books, a very large story, and (2) the fact that I purposely did the first, oh, perhaps 80 pages of
*The Eye of the World*
as an homage to Tolkien in a way, that it was set in the same sort of pastoral country that Tolkien wrote about.

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#18)

#### Question

Which of the first seven books is your favorite?

#### Robert Jordan

My favorite book is always the book I'm working on at the moment.

#### Footnote

The questioner was apparently trying to cleverly evade the stock answer, but RJ didn't fall for it.

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#19)

#### Question

Just curious, but what culture(s) were the Seanchan based on?

#### Robert Jordan

A good deal of Japan, of the Shogunites, Imperial China, and in general a good many rigid hierarchical stratified societies. Too many to list really, I suppose.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#20)

#### Question

Speaking of favorites, do you have a favorite character perhaps?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm afraid that my favorite character also happens to be whoever I'm writing at the moment.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#21)

#### Question

Does RAFO mean you don't know how it will turn out, or do you want to keep us in suspense?

#### Robert Jordan

I want to keep you in suspense. If I give away all of the secrets, sooner or later you guys are going to start saying "Well I know all of this stuff. He's really gotten boring!"

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#22)

#### Question

Did you get any inspiration from Arthurian legend?

#### Robert Jordan

Quite a bit, along with other Celtic myths and Norse myths and African and Middle-Eastern, and Hindu and Chinese and Japanese and Native American and even Australian Aboriginal. Plus some others here and there to tell you the truth.

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#23)

#### Question

Did your purposefully use Neo-Pagan and New Age influences to develop the WOT series?

#### Robert Jordan

Not knowingly no. I don't think so.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#24)

#### Question

Would you ever consent to a movie?

#### Robert Jordan

Sure! But who's going to make a movie at 16 or 18 hours per book? If anybody out there actually thinks he can cut one of these books down to a two hour movie, I suspect he's been drinking something funny!

#### Question

Well, there's always the option of a mini-series.

#### Footnote

At the time, full-season book adaptations were unheard of.

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#25)

#### Question

Why is there such a long delay before characters return to the main story? i.e.: Lan.

#### Robert Jordan

Not everybody can be center stage front at the same time.

## [Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#26)

#### Question

Are you saying all the characters are based on various cultures around the world?

#### Robert Jordan

Bits and pieces sometimes. Not the characters, but the nations are sometimes based on bits and pieces of actual cultures and quite often it has nothing to do with any culture that I am aware of consciously.

## [Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#27)

#### Question

Robert, do you see yourself as any of the characters?

#### Robert Jordan

I see myself as whoever I happen to be writing at the moment. Other people have notions... they think I'm this character or that. I'm everybody.

## [Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#28)

#### Question

Do you completely control what the characters do, or do they occasionally surprise you with their actions?

#### Robert Jordan

The characters never surprise me. In terms of the book I am God. A writer who says that the characters take control is doing one of two things... either he or she is telling people what they want to hear because a lot of people seem to want to hear that the characters have taken over... or else, that writer is being exceedingly lazy and not paying attention. The characters NEVER really take over.

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#29)

#### Question

Will there be one artist on the book or a multitude?

#### Robert Jordan

If you mean The Guide, it will be one artist all the way through, a man named Todd Hamilton.

## [Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#30)

#### Question

Do you ever get tired of people turning every typo in your books into another plot line?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I just wish I could stop there from being any typos.

## [Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=74#31)

#### Host

Robert, thank you so very much for taking your time to appear on AOL tonight. Any final comments for your audience?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes guys. Sorry if I was illiterate anywhere. I think I was in a few places. I am tired tonight. Good night everybody.

#### Host

And a special thanks to the audience for joining us. Have a good evening, folks. Until next time, AOL!

#### Footnote

He did misspell Tolkien. (In his defense, the questioner did also.)
