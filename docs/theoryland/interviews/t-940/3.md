# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#3)

#### Wetlander

Can you tell me more about the Jenn now, or do I have to wait for the encyclopedia? Will the encyclopedia tell what happened to them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

General refusal to answer: shrugging, changing the subject, etc. :)

#### Wetlander

(Yes, it was nearly a joke, because I've been pestering Brandon about the Jenn for over a year now, either in person or by proxy...)
