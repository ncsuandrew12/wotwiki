# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#12)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’ve got three names, and you can tell me what you think. Peter wants “Knights Radiant”; Moshe, my editor, wants “Lightweaver”; and I want “The Words of Radiance.” For the second Stormlight book.

(general chaotic discussion of names, pros and cons)

#### Harriet:

I don’t like yours, it’s too long.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

They like “Lightweaver” – I’m worried, having a book called “A Memory of Light” and then another one with Light in the title the same year, which was why I didn’t go with that.

(more general chaotic discussion)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You guys are voting for Knights Radiant. It seems too on the nose for me, is the thing. Like naming Pat’s (Rothfuss) new book “Kvothe has sex” or something like that, you know? Yes, it’s what the book’s about, but it’s very on the nose – it’s exactly what the book’s about. Does that make sense? That’s why it bothers me, but that’s why all the marketing people are like “Yeah, that’s what it’s about! Let’s make it!”

#### HARRIET

Think. up. a. new. one.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, but Moshe needs it like two weeks ago!

#### HARRIET

Some other weaver. Radiant Weaver.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Hey, that’s not bad. That’s actually good. You can make it two words.

(more chaos)

#### HARRIET

It’s better than the other three. I haven’t read a word of it...!

#### Footnote

Brandon ended up going with Words of Radiance
