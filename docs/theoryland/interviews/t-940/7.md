# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#7)

#### Wetlander

Can you give any further detail on Min's viewing of Aviendha having Rand's babies? (Per the quotation: "Aviendha would have Rand's babies, too. Four of them at once! Something was odd about that, though. The babies would be healthy, but still something odd.")

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are natural quadruplets (no, Aviendha does not adopt Min's or Elayne's children in order to get four), and the "odd" thing is specifically their ability to channel from birth.

#### Footnote

Min's viewing about Aviendha's babies was in
*Winter's Heart*
, Chapter 12.
