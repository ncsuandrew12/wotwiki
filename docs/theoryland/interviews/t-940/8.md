# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#8)

#### Wetlander

Some would like a definitive answer: Are channelers ever bound to the Horn? (Rand? Egwene?)

#### Brandon Sanderson

"They certainly could be." Brandon and Harriet agreed that, although the notes never specified any channelers who were so bound, there was nothing in the notes to indicate it couldn’t/didn't happen either, and they both believe it’s entirely possible.

#### Wetlander

(A follow-on question might be asked about whether Egwene might be a Hero, but they didn't give me the impression that they were hedging—which they probably would have, if that were in the notes.)

#### Footnote

RJ
[previously confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=86#3)
that Rand/Lews Therin was a Hero of the Horn.
