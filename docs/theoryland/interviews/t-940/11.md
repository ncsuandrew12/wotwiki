# [Interview #940, Entry #11]: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#11)

#### Wetlander

Did the name "
*s'redit*
" have anything to do with "editor"?

#### Harriet McDougal

No, she didn't think so; however, she told the story... The Ringling Brothers (I think) circus came to town and she & Jim went to watch the elephants being unloaded. It was quite an impressive sight, and she indicated that was when he decided to put them in the books. Also, watching the (incredible!) acrobats, she's pretty sure that's when the ideas for Luca's menagerie etc. came into being.

#### Footnote

RJ actually
[told the story](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#20)
in 2001 of how going to the circus inspired him to include Valan Luca's show in the books.
