#### Wetlander

Since balefire strengthens
*cuendillar*
, what effect would Egwene's opposing "Flame of Tar Valon" weave have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question!

#### Wetlander

(But then we got interrupted and didn't come back to it, so if someone is curious, they could try again and get the rest of the answer. Related questions might be... Would Egwene's weave strengthen
*cuendillar*
simply because it is the One Power? If for every weave there is an opposite weave, could there be a weave that would turn the Tar Valon harbor chains back to iron?)
