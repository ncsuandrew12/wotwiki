# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#1)

#### Wetlander

Okay. Here's the (mostly) verbatim transcription of the Seattle Memory Keepers conversation with Harriet & Brandon. It's not every last bit; I left out the worst of the chatter except where it actually led to the next good question. JeffS is JeffS, WL is me, and the rest of the initials are the various non-rereader MKs except where I couldn't tell for sure who was talking, in which case I just used MK. Much of this I already posted, but this is directly from the recording.
