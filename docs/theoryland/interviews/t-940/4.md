# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#4)

#### Wetlander

Was Bao the Wyld part of Sharan prophecy? If so, was Demandred co-opting their Dragon prophecies?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"The Wyld" was part of Sharan prophecy; Demandred thinks he co-opted the Sharan version of the "dragon prophecies" but it was actually about him all along.

#### Wetlander

(I was surprised to get an answer to this; I expect some of it will show up in "River of Souls" anyway. An interesting follow-on question might be whether this means the Sharans were destined by the Pattern to fight for Team Dark.)
