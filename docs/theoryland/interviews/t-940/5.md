# [Interview #940: AMOL Signing Report - Wetlander, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=940#5)

#### Wetlander

Will you confirm now that Rand's sword (received in
*The Gathering Storm*
, given to Tam in
*A Memory of Light*
) is Hawkwing's sword Justice?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Yes, I can now confirm that. It's also my sword." (But in-world, it's Justice.)

#### Wetlander

(Possible follow-on question, if anyone is interested: Is there a backstory on it, e.g. the theory that Hawkwing took it from Guaire Amalasan? What about the idea that it came from the War of Power and was Lews Therin's own sword then?)
