## [Entry #1](./t-736/1)

#### firstRainbowRose

I got this e-mail from someone and knew I had to share it. Thanks Brian for passing word along!

#### BRIAN T. HILL

I have some news that will probably be of interest to readers of 17thshard.com. Perhaps you’ll be kind enough to publish this for me.

## [Entry #2](./t-736/2)

#### Brian T. Hill

I took my
*Way of Kings*
audio book to the Sanderson signing event in Seattle last night. He was reluctant to give out many Cosmere secrets because he thinks he’s given too many already. However, he agreed to give me one. When he had trouble thinking of one, I suggested that he name one of the unknown shards. I didn’t really expect him to agree, but he did! When he opened his computer to take a look, I chided him. “There are only 16 shards. Don’t you have them memorized?”

#### Brandon Sanderson

He responded that sometimes he has several synonyms that he hasn’t quite decided on. So I asked him if he was now canonizing a new shard and he said yes. So this is now official. He agreed to let me share it, so here it is.

I’ve attached the picture for you to see for yourself, but the text says: “The second shard on the
*Elantris*
world (Sel) is Dominion.”
