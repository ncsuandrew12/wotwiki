#### Ramo from Montreal, Canada

Hello, Mr. Jordan. I have enjoyed reading the Wheel of Time series since the beginning. Now throughout your books, we learn more and more about the fascinating relationship existing between a Warder and his Aes Sedai. We learn that even thought the Warder gains some abilities, he is not on equal footing with his Aes Sedai, who can even control to a certain degree his mind. Now, would you care telling us your personal views on "Warderhood," and if such a thing was possible would you be willing to be a Warder?
