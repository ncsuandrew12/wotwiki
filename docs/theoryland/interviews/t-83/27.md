#### Josh from Preston, CT

Hello, Mr. Jordan. I find the magic system in the series so complex and fascinating. Could you tell us if it is something you worked out before you started writing the series, or did you just add things in as you went along?

#### Robert Jordan

I had the basis of it before I began writing, and a good part of how it fit together. Other parts were added in when I realized that there was a question to be answeredâ€”something that I had to decide here and now, how this worked. But I have now quite a large file describing the One Power and how it works, and the things that can be done with it and the things that can't be done, and the exceptions to the rules and all that. It would probably be 300 pages if I printed it out, maybe a little more, but I never have. It's just a computer file at the moment.
