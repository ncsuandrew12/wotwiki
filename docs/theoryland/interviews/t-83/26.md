#### Lyle from Fostoria, Michigan

Mr. Jordan, thank you for such wonderful reading! I look forward to reading the new novel. My question is will there be a book similar to
*The Silmarillion*
about the Wheel of Time universe?

#### Robert Jordan

It's quite possible, but we'll see what happens. It's still a few years in the future, after all.
