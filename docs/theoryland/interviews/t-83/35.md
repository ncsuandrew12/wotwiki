#### DS from www.wotism.org

Was the Dark Prophecy in
*The Great Hunt*
("Now the Great Lord comes...") a real prophecy, or was it a taunt?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out.

#### Footnote

RJ suggested in the
[TOR Questions of the Week](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=7#10)
that it was indeed a prophecy (simply by referring to it as a prophecy).
