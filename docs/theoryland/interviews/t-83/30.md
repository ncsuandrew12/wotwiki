#### Only me from Texas

I realize books take a long time to write, but why did it take 2.5 years to write this and then leave out Mat? Will the next book take as long?

#### Robert Jordan

I hope the next book will not take as long. "New Spring" took several months to write, and I also spent several months working on the illustrated guide. So those, between the two of them, took a lot more time than I thought it was going to. That delayed this book considerably.

#### Footnote

Although this was the night before the release, it's typical for some fans to get early copies (in various ways) and to leak certain tidbits on the web in the week or two before everyone else gets it.
