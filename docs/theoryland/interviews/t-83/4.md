#### Altanar from Milltown, IN

Do you plan on writing any more books after the Wheel of Time that are set in the Randland universe?

#### Robert Jordan

Not at this time, I do not. I have plans for another set of books, but not in the same universe. If a really terrific notion occurs to me for a set of stories that I would like to write, then I would go back to the universe of the Wheel of Time, but otherwise, I won't.
