#### Stormy Conner from Texas

I would first like to say thank you for writing this wonderful series; it has been a pleasure reading the series and becoming familiar with your characters. My question, I believe, has been answered in the books but I want to clarify it in case I have been reading too much into it. Is the gift the Aes Sedai get from the bonding the ability to take or drain energy from their Warder for their own use? I believe this was stated in "New Spring" at the end, but I didn't know if it was a literal statement or figurative. Thank you for your time.

#### Robert Jordan

That is one of the gifts. She can draw as much strength as she needsâ€”as a matter of fact, she could take it all. In other words, she could kill him.
