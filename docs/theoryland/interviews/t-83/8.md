#### Nansen from Ithaca, NY

Hi, Mr. Jordan! I love your books! I have both the hardcover and paperback editions of all the Wheel of Time books. Can you please tell us why the cover to the paperback edition of
*A Crown of Swords*
is different from the hardcover? Thanks!

#### Robert Jordan

I'm afraid that was purely a marketing decision. Tor Books felt that there were stores and outlets that would not accept a fantasy cover. And they seemed to have been right.
