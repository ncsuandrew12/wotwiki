#### The Man from Ganymede from WoTism

How far in advance did you plan the later novels like
*Lord of Chaos*
and
*A Crown of Swords*
? Did you know the series would be this long when you started?

#### Robert Jordan

I did not know the series would be this long in the beginning. When I first went to my publisher, I told him, I know the beginning, and I know the ending, and I know what I want to happen in-between, but I'm not sure I know how long it will take me to get from the beginning to the end. Now, don't laugh, but I said to him, "It's going to be at least three or four books, and it might be as many as five or six."
