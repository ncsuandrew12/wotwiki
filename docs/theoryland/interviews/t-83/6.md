#### Andrew Wooster from Pomona College

Do you feel that the fantasy genre of literature has any importance in society, and if so, what is its importance?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I think it has too many levels of importance to go into all of them here, but the one that is very clear to me is the human need for myth. We have tried to scrape away, carve away, all the myths in our lives, but we do have that need. It can be demonstrated as simply as by looking at the rise of urban legends. Humans have a deep need for myth, and fantasy literature helps to provide that, I think. Or at least to provide an outlet for that need.
