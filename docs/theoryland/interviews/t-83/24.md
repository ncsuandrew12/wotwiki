#### AOL\_VBT\_Tav from Indianapolis

The TOR page says that
*The Path of Daggers*

#### Robert Jordan

Well, you don't have to wait a few days...all you have to wait is a few hours! And, no, I'm not going to give you any special insights. You may have come across an acronymâ€”RAFO. Need I say more?
