# [Interview #83: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=83#19)

#### Phillip from Indianapolis, IN

Why has Rand not made any attempt to reach or communicate with Tam? Is he trying to remain isolated from his former life?

#### Robert Jordan

Remember that Rand believes that the more interest he shows in his family, and in any of the people of the Two Rivers, the more he makes them a target. If his enemies believe that they hurt Rand by hurting Tam or hurting the Two Rivers, then they will, so Rand has set himself on a course of pretending to have forgotten his past. Pretending to have grown beyond his rude country beginnings. He thinks he has to make his enemies believe that the Two Rivers no longer mean anything to him. And the same for Tam.
