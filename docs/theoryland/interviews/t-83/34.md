How many books long do you think the Wheel of Time series will end up being? Do you have any idea how long it will take to finish writing the series?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm not really clear. When I finished
*A Crown of Swords*
, I said it would take me at least three books more to finish. Now that I have completed
*The Path of Daggers*
, it looks like it will take me at least three more books to finish. Believe me, guys, I'm trying as hard as I can to get there as fast as I can.
