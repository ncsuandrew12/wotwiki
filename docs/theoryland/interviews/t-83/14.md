#### Shawn from t\_voice@bellsouth.net

What are the chances of seeing any adaptations either film or television of any characters from the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

I really don't know. I occasionally have gotten approaches in the past, but the books are all so long and involved that I think it would take a 16-hour movie to do any one of the books. We'll see what happens.
