# [Interview #1146: Shadows of Self-Idaho Falls, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1146#1)

#### Dearius

We know that investiture physically affects and changes people's bodies, so aside from the chance of being born as a misting, feruchemist, ect. Can investiture physically or biologically affect the magic user's descendants, and if so then in what way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You are on to something there, but I can't give details without spoilers. He then elaborated that it plays a major part on Sel. In response I asked if the Alethi were descendants of the original Knights Radiant and if their descendants had light eyes due to their ancestor's use of stormlight/Natal Bond. He said I was on to something but to RAFO.
