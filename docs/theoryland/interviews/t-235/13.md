# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#13)

#### Question

The first girl to ask a question asked, "Why is it that the most powerful women in the world perceive their power as stemming from a 'pale, white shaft'?"

#### Robert Jordan

RJ chuckled, and then said if you "missed the symbolism there, you just don't get it." He also said that if their power came from a "hole in the ground" it just wouldn't be as much fun, and they would only be feared if you thought you might "fall in", which would not be much fun, he assured us.

#### Footnote

This question was also asked by
[Fomu](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=233#6)
and
[Jarrod](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=234#5)
, and the latter report seems to make it clear that RJ was referencing the
