# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#11)

#### Question

The NEXT guy asked how the bond the Asha'man use is different than the Warder bond of the Aes Sedai.

#### Robert Jordan

He explained that the bond is different because it contains that "extra bit" about obedience. Aes Sedai bound to Asha'man are compelled to comply with the demands of the men. While Aes Sedai can do this to their Warders, it requires work each time. He mentioned that Logain thinks that extra bit can be easily removed, but that the Asha'man feel this is EXTREMELY necessary. A Warder would not kill his Aes Sedai when she turned her back, but the Asha'man have NO such safety with their bound Aes Sedai.
