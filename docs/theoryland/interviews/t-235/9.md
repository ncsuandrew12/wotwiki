# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#9)

#### Kevin Dean

I then asked, "Other than the Third Age, obviously, what events signal the end or the beginning of other Ages?"

#### Robert Jordan

He explained that SOME call the "current" Age the Third Age. He made it very clear that not everyone does, or has. He then said that Age ending events don't fit a certain set of criteria, but "you'll know it when you see it."
