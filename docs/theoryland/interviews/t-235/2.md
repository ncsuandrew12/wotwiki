# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#2)

#### Kevin Dean

One of the employees introduced RJ, and he came up on stage to much applause.

#### Robert Jordan

When he stepped to the podium, the applause ended, to which he replied "Don't stop!" This got laughs and more applause.

He commented that he has NOT read anything posted on fan sites since the tour began, and went on to say that he would be repeating himself. "You'll be saying, 'I've heard all this before'. Well, you haven't. You've READ it before."
