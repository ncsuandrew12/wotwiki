# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#8)

#### Question

Someone asked how he felt about Salvatore using the same range of mountains called the Spine of the World.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ basically said, "It makes sense as a name, The Spine of the World." He can understand that it would also occur to other authors, and that he doesn't mind Salvatore using it, since he doesn't own a trademark on it.
