# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#1)

#### Kevin Dean

The book signing was at Joseph-Beth booksellers, a really nice and really classy bookstore. The signing was planned to take place in the back of the store, where they have an entire wall of glass, overlooking a fountain. About 300 people milled around, most crowding the aisles but a few sitting on the floor right in front of the red rope. A J-B employee came up to inform us RJ would be out promptly at 7, and invited us to come forward and maximize the space, as there were already 350 ticket-holders to the event, and more on-lookers. The milling throng pressed forward, and I managed to get a seat slightly to the left of the podium, third row back. This seat worked out well, because I had the opportunity to get great shots of RJ while he was speaking, and right before he began signing, after had had sat down.
