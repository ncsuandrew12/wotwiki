# [Interview #235: KOD Signing Report - Kevin Dean, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=235#16)

#### Robert Jordan

The store employee told RJ that time was running out, so he had to end the Q&A session. He then got up and began walking to the signing table, where he stumbled down the stairs. Thank you, whomever it was that caught him!

I then snapped a picture, and RJ stood up to make a comment. I truly feared I had bothered him. He said that if we would like to take photos, please let him know so that he could look up, so you would get more than just the top of his head. He then said he only has one rule, "No male nudity!"
