He then mentioned the two planned prequels, and said they would be written. After a brief pause, he said "...I would not write in the Wheel of Time universe again unless I had a GREAT idea. I may have had one." He went on to say that he has an idea that MIGHT end up being two or maybe three 'outrigger' novels, not part of the main sequence, and not prequels per se, but following other characters, at another time. He said this is not definite, and that he had to "poke around at the idea" before he decided. He doesn't want to "write anything just to write it".
