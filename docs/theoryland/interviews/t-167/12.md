# [Interview #167: COT Signing Report - Tallis, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#12)

#### Robert Jordan

He had always planned on killing Sammael per Mashadar; his death was not determined after the ambiguous ending of that book. RJ said something along the lines of, "Yes, I know it wasn't with trumpets and fanfare [referring to Sammael's death]; but he deserved it. He was a louse, and he got a louse's death. He was killed by an enemy he wasn't paying attention to. He lived like a louse, and he died like a louse."

#### Tallis

Yes, he said "louse" that many times, if not more. You'd think Sammael had personally wronged RJ, sheeshâ€”he sounded pretty impassioned. Then again, it could simply be his exasperation with people refusing to accept that Sammael died.
