# [Interview #167: COT Signing Report - Tallis, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#3)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ then announced that someone had figured out who had killed Asmodean using only the clues found in the books including and preceding the character's death.

#### Tallis

Give me a break; one person figures it out, and he calls it "obvious" (at least according to the FAQ)? Agh. I really don't think it's Graendal anymore, considering the tremendous influx of theories of her culpability in the past X years. You'd think RJ would have commented on
*that*
several books/years ago...?
