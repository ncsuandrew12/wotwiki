# [Interview #167: COT Signing Report - Tallis, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#11)

#### Robert Jordan

I'm sure I misheard, but I could have sworn he talked about writing
*five*
prequels. Again, though, I'm uncertain.

#### Footnote

All the other reports about prequels support the notion that RJ planned, in addition to
*New Spring*
, only two more prequels: one about Tam al'Thor and the other about how Moiraine and Lan ended up in the Two Rivers in the nick of time.
