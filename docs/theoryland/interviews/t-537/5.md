# [Interview #537: Orem Library Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=537#5)

#### Matt Hatch

(for WSB): The next question is from a Theorylander. Did Ishamaelâ€™s healing of Lews Therin back in the prologue of

create the same doctor-patient bond as when Nynaeve healed Egwene?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, not that I know. I think that I would know, but no.
