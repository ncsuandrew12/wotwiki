#### Matt Hatch

The other question I had…someone wants to know if you are ever coming up to Ontario, Canada?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We did have a Canadian Con invite me. 2012? (Asks his wife) I would really like to do a Canadian tour next fall, since I don’t have a tour scheduled, since there are no books coming out next fall. So I might try to do a Canadian tour next fall.
