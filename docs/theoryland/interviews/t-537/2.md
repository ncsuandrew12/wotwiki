# [Interview #537, Entry #2]: Orem Library Signing Report - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=537#2)

#### Matt Hatch

(General summarization of the attack on Rand) Moridin is speaking to the Chosen. He’s kind of pissed. He’s saying look somebody, it was either Sammael or someone pretending to be Sammael, but it was definitely one of the Chosen. Is Moridin’s assumption/belief correct, that the only way for that to have occurred was for one of the Chosen to be involved?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone very high up would have to have been involved.

#### Matt Hatch

(Laughter) I should have phrased the question differently…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone very high up would have to have been involved. It didn’t just happen.

#### Matt Hatch

When you say high up, do you mean marked or someone with great power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone with great influence and power among the, the um…the, among those who follow the Shadow would have to have been involved.

#### Matt Hatch

(Laughter) So, are you suggesting that it may not have been just one person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I said what I said (smiles).

#### Matt Hatch

(Sorry Terez—made up these questions on the fly, so they weren’t very good, but it’s something to chew on. Next.)
