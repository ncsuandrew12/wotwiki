# [Interview #537, Entry #1]: Orem Library Signing Report - Matt Hatch](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=537#1)

#### Matt Hatch

My son (he's ten and wore his Theoryland t-shirt) and I went down to Brandon's signing at the Orem, UT library this evening. I have the audio of the general Q&A with the audience, but nothing specific to anything WoT related, so I'm not going to transcribe that right now.

After the speech and Q&A, we waited for the line of those waiting for their books to be signed to end. I didn't come with a list of questions, but I figured I couldn't leave without asking a couple. So, here are the few I askedâ€”two are ones I came up with regarding two recently discussed theories and the rest were submitted by fans via @Theoryland on Twitter.

Short and sweet.
