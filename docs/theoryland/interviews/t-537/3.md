# [Interview #537: Orem Library Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=537#3)

#### Matt Hatch

This has to do with the Luckers’ Shiny Dragon theory. Masema mentions having a vision, someone tells him to kill Perrin. So, my question, was the individual telling him to kill Perrin a male or female?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He saw a male.

#### Matt Hatch

He did, but was the individual a male or a female?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs appreciatively and pauses)

Yes, yes he was a male or a female.

#### Matt Hatch

(Laughs) Was the individual a male?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Thoughtful, deep intake of breath, pause)

#### Matt Hatch

…as classically defined by his physical…(laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Says, yes I get what you are asking)…

#### Matt Hatch

...I’ll say it this way, does this individual have the soul of a man or a woman?

#### Brandon Sanderson

mmmhmm. (pauses looking up for a good twenty or thirty seconds)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Female.

#### Matt Hatch

Excellent.
