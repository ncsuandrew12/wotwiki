# [Interview #304: Robert Jordan's Blog: A BRIEF ADD-ON, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=304#1)

#### Robert Jordan

I don't know exactly why the calendar contest is being limited to US residents. It is something the legal department insisted on. Now, if it was me, and I lived in Canada or Finland or somewhere, I might just take a chance that they wouldn't look too closely at the return address. Or maybe I'd ask Justin to be a cut-out for me. But that's just me. I would never suggest that any of you do these things. No. Never. Wouldn't be prudent.
