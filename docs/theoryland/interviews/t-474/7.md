# [Interview #474: TGS Signing Report - Katie Frey, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=474#7)

#### Question

Was the passage about Cadsuane spanking Semirhage already written, or was there just information in the notes? How did you feel about writing that section?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was given creative freedom to do what was needed. No author can ever stick 100% to an outline, things change as they are being written, and he was given that kind of control in order to make the books work. Regarding that passage in particular, it made Brandon Sanderson cringe, but Robert Jordan wanted it in the books so it stayed.
