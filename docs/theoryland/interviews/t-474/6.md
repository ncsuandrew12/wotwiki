#### Question

What is Robert Jordan's office like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He worked on the first floor of a carriage house, the first room was a big library and the second was like a "wizard's workshop." The Brown Aes Sedai whose quarters he describes in
*The Gathering Storm*
, with skeletons everywhere, was basically a description of Robert Jordan's office. He had skeletons everywhere, and weapons (though the weapons were left out of the Aes Sedai's room).

#### Footnote

The Brown in question is Bennae Nalsad.
