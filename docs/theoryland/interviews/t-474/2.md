# [Interview #474: TGS Signing Report - Katie Frey, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=474#2)

#### Question

What character is easiest for you to write? Which is most difficult?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Two Rivers folk were the easiest (Rand, Perrin, Mat, Egwene, and Nynaeve). Aviendha was the most difficult. She thinks more like an Aiel than most Aiel. But he was glad to bring her back to the forefront because he had always liked the way she thought. Tuon was not easy either.
