#### Question

Were you surprised to learn who Asmodean's killer was?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, not really. He had read every theory out there, and there is basically a theory for every character. One of those theories is right (he won't say which of course!), so since he had already read the theory it wasn't a surprise just an "ah, so it was that person."
