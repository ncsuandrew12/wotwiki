#### Question

When are books 13 and 14 due out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is three-fourths of the way through
*Towers of Midnight*
, and he expects to turn that in in January. He hasn't been able to write as much as he had hoped during this 26-city tour, so that is putting him back a bit, but he is still confident he can get it in close to on time. It took him 16 months to write
*The Gathering Storm*
, and some of that writing ended up being allocated to
*Towers of Midnight*
. He expects it to be published in the fall of 2010, or at the latest March of 2011.
