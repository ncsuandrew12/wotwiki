# [Interview #474: TGS Signing Report - Katie Frey, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=474#4)

#### Question

What is your favorite scene that you got to add?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm not saying which scenes I added and which parts are Jordan's until all three books are out." He has lots and lots of notes left by Robert Jordan, which aren't organized. No one really knew how Robert Jordan was organizing his work. Some files had only sentences, some whole paragraphs and whole scenes. His assistants, Maria and others, what Brandon calls "his own personal Brown Ajah" started asking Robert Jordan questions about all of the characters, where they would end up and how they got there. So Brandon has so much information all jumbled together without any order. And it's his job to take all that and make a book.
