#### Octavia

5. I know the second book in the series isn't due out until next year, but can you tell us how many books there will be total in the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A trilogy. As for it being open-ended, I can't reveal the ending of the third book, or anything about it, while the first book is just barely out! So, you'll have to wait and see.
