# [Interview #885: AMOL Signing Report - Christine, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=885#16)

#### Question

What do you like most and least working on the novels?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Liked Perrin, and misses writing some of the PoVs. Had to constantly research things to make certain it was accurate, but won't miss fulfilling everything that was foreshadowed...lots of the foreshadowing will be mentioned in the encyclopedia in a year and a half.

#### Harriet McDougal

Two years.
