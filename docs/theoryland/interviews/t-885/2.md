#### Christine

Truly, it was bittersweet, listening to Harriet reading the first paragraph of Chapter One in
*A Memory of Light*
...or
*The Eye of the World*
. That first paragraph, which has stayed with us for a generation, elicited silence from the entire crowd as they simply sat, watched, and listened. It was truly emotional, hearing those words.

#### Harriet McDougal
