# [Interview #885, Entry #1]: AMOL Signing Report - Christine](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=885#1)

#### Christine

Bittersweet. That word seemed to be the common answer from Team Jordan as they talked about the completion of
*A Memory of Light*
. After 23 years since the first publishing of
*The Eye of the World*
in 1990, the long journey has come to a completion. Harriet McDougal, widow of the late Robert Jordan, and Brandon Sanderson, who has completed the last three books of the series with the help of notes, were joined by the other two members of Team Jordan, Maria Simons and Alan Romanczuk. While Harriet continued to edit the series as Brandon wrote it, Maria worked on continuity, and Alan worked on the great battles and commanders. The entire team was present for the Q&A and signing, and answered a number of questions for those present.
