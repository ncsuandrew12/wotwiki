#### Question

Did Charleston have a lot of influence on the Ogier?

#### Harriet McDougal

#### Maria Simons

Actually, it was later revealed that Ogier was a subconscious thing, as Jim wanted something close to the term "ogre".

#### Harriet McDougal

And, Jim grew up in a small town, much the same as the Two Rivers in their treatment of strangers.
