Ask him if there is a Waygate anywhere near Lugard. We suspect that Ogier-built Shaemal was somewhere in Murandy.

Why does it matter where Shaemal is?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188596257328074752)

It only matters because of the possibility of a Waygate in Murandy, which is why I phrased the question the way I did.

It has to do with the theory that Roedran is Demandred. ;)

Okay, I'll ask that one next time!

Answer re Lugard Waygate: "\*chuckles\* That's clever! Anything I say will give away too much, so I'll have to RAFO that one."
