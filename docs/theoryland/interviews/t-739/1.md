This is a collection of tweets mostly from PRK about answers Brandon gave at SwanCon in Perth. PRK was
[too busy running the con](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188587103758729216)
to write up a report.

Walked along the water in Perth today. I was not attacked by a single snake, spider, or shark. Australia, you're letting me down.

Also, PRK from #swancon did indeed warn me about drop-bears. I will be sure to wear vegemite behind my ears to protect myself.

Had a very lovely dinner at Bonsai with @BrandSanderson and @mdepierres—they're fantastic guests! #Swancon is going to be awesome.
