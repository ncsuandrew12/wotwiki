Ask him if the manner of the Aiel service to the Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends was just Singing, or if it was also domestic.

As a follow-up you could ask him if female Voices were also used in non-Earthy scenarios, i.e. to enhance

in particular?

And ask him if non-Aiel could really have the Voice (assuming the type that enhances channeling) or if Lews Therin was just confused.

Lews Therin was confused about time and place, but what he was saying was possible.

There was more than just singing, but Brandon wasn't willing to go into it. Unsure if that was RAFO or irrelevance.

Brandon said he wasn't willing to talk much about the Voice things. I got the sense it was a subtle RAFO.
