Brandon tried to get moments for every character in
*A Memory of Light*
. Egwene is ready to be bad ass in the Last Battle; her character development is done.

Perth Exclusive for #WoT counted scenes by viewpoint. Rand has the most viewpoints in
*A Memory of Light*
, not a huge margin. Others tied.

Caveat, still revising
*A Memory of Light*
, so that can change.

It's not much but Brandon S just told me that Lan has the most POVs in
*A Memory of Light*
, only just ahead of Rand. But that could change with editing.

#### [PRK](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/188551816991084544)

I thought he said Rand ahead of the other main characters?

#### [TEREZ](https://twitter.com/Terez27/status/188567454895702017)

That doesn't even make sense. :s Sure, Lan is vital, but it's hard to see how the story could focus on him that much.

#### [PRK (8 APRIL)](https://twitter.com/prkaye/status/189188554004500483)

Confirmed it was Rand with the highest number of POV scenes in
*A Memory of Light*
(at the moment).

#### Footnote

It might be that Brandon said Rand was first just ahead of Lan, and Lisa-Maree mixed them up, but it seems somewhat unlikely.
