#### Ryan Wolf

Jordan is here, I've met him today.

There was a TV Show, he was the Star guest, and I was the Fan. We will [send it over to you].

Tomorrow we well go to a restaurant with Mr. Jordan, and the day after there will be the book signing.

I'm planning to make a Diary both in English and Hungarian. Maybe you could publish it in your site?

Harriet told us that she will send her Poems. We can share it as well.
