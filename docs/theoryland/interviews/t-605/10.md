Did Alviarin kill Carlinya?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m answering too many of these; I’m going to RAFO that one.

This question was asked in reference to the question of why Min's raven tattoo viewing of Carlinya seemed to have been unfulfilled when she died. Alviarin's mark might have explained it; however Maria
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#28)
it just meant she would be killed by the Black Ajah.
