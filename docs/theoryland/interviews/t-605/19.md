# [Interview #605, Entry #19]: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#19)

#### Terez

When did Lan first become a blademaster?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(reading) When did Lan (LAHN) first become...oh, Lan (rhymes with pan), sorry. I hear all these names at JordanCon, and half of them pronounce them one way, and half of them the other way, and I end up getting bad habits.

#### Terez

Yeah. I don’t care.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, but Robert Jordan cared, so I try to care.

#### Terez

So is it Lahn or Lan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s Lan.

#### Terez

Okay, good, because that’s how I pronounce it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know—someone could correct me—it’s Lan, but Lan was one of those ones that—I believe—some major source had wrong. I could be completely wrong on this. I know Tar Valon (Tar va-LAHN), one major source had wrong, meaning an audiobook reader, or an original typo in one of the glossaries, or something, which really itched at Jim as I understand because he really wanted it to be Tar va-LAHN and not Tar VA-lun. So...when did Lan first become a blademaster? Well...between
*New Spring*
and
*The Eye of the World*
.

#### Terez

(laughs) Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wait, didn't he...he wasn't a blademaster in
*New Spring*
, was he? No...

#### Terez

Not that I'm aware of. And Ryne was better than him then at that time, so...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So, somewhere in between those two. I suspect that was one of the things that Jim wanted to do in the prequel.

#### Terez

Right. Because there was definitely not a big deal made of it when he killed Toram Riatin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Maria Simons

Okay, the notes say that Lan became a blademaster before he turned 20, which would have been before
*New Spring*
. My thoughts on this are that Lan got his sword at an early age, and worked really hard with it, and was judged a blademaster by five blademasters sometime pretty early on. It's not mentioned specifically that I can find in
*New Spring*
, but it makes sense to me.
