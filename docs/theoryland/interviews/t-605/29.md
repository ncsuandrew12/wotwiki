# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#29)

#### Terez

Does one
typically
(emphasized in the list he was reading) have to visit Shayol Ghul to be granted permission to use the True Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um...(pause) Yes. I see what you're fishing for there.

#### Terez

Well, I mean...obviously. I didn't think I would slip that one past you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Footnoteâ€”Terez

I was mainly following up on
[Freelancer's question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#14)
. Despite the confusion, most fans believe that Rand accessed the True Power through his link with Moridin (and most also believe the Dark One is okay with this, despite not having granted explicit permission). Brandon's answer to Freelancer seemed to confirm that, but then Brandon denied he had actually said that.
