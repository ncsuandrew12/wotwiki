# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#13)

#### Terez

Have Egwene's dreams concerning Gawyn all been fulfilled?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which one are they asking about?

#### Terez

This is my question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because it was a Min vision, about holding her life...

#### Terez

No, no...I know the difference. I’m thinking mostly of the fork in the road that Gawyn comes to in Egwene’s dream, and down one road they marry, and down the other they don’t...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, yes. That has been fulfilled. That fork in the road was the same decision that Min saw. Those were parallel [prophecies]. And that prophecy did get fulfilled...and the meaning of that is...there is no hidden meaning, no 'Surprise, that wasn’t really it!' You saw it: if Gawyn had not returned when he did, Egwene would have died.

#### Footnote—Terez

Brandon didn't let me finish telling him the dream, so I asked him about it again
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#158)
. The dream actually refers to Gawyn's death rather than Egwene's, and was not fulfilled until
*A Memory of Light*
when they married (which set Gawyn down the chosen path).
