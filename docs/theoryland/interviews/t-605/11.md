# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#11)

What did Cadsuane use to blackmail Flinn, Narishma, and Manfor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. ... That one’s mostly a MAFO. I’ll be honest. That’s a question I should have looked at.

#### Terez

Yeah, I figured it was; I was hoping actually to catch Maria on that one. That was from Wetlander from tor.com.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, was it? Hi Wetlander! That’s one I should know. I’m pretty sure it’s in there somewhere. That’s one I should have looked up, but I’ve just never looked it up. So...

A quote from the notes: "For the men, it would have been at least partly a matter of blackmail. They are distrusting of Rand, and also of Taim to various degrees; none thinks it's safe to go back to the Black Tower; they are known in Cairhien as men who can channel, and also elsewhere, making them marked to an extent, at least on their own."

So it wasn't anything really hidden, it was just "let us bond you and we'll help you; otherwise you’re all on your own." And it was Hopwil, not Manfor, who was in the first group bonded.

#### Footnote—Terez

I took the three names from Taim's list of "deserters" given to Rand by Logain in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, Chapter 24; Cadsuane wasn't too specific: "Blackmail was a tool she disliked using, but she had already used it on the three Asha'man..." That was in
*Winter's Heart*
Chapter 13; she told Rand about the three bonded Asha'man in Chapter 25, and indeed Karldin Manfor was not among those three.
