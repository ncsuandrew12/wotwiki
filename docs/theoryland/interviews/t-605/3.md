When you
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#136)
some Forsaken are Dreamers, you meant they have prophetic dreams, right? Or are they just Dreamwalkers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did mean Dreamers. People have been trying to pin me down on that one.

#### Terez

Yeah, everybody has been like convinced that you were just confused...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...that I was just confused. No. I meant Dreamers. I DID INDEED MEAN DREAMERS.

#### Terez

I know you did, but...just verifying.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. And I’m like 95% on that one. We’ll put an asterisk on it. I actually sent Maria deeper into the notes, but I know at least one is, and I’m pretty sure one of each gender is.

#### Footnote

The most likely candidates seem to be
[Moridin](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#57)
,
[Cyndane](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=773#13)
, and Moghedien, who are undeniably the most skilled at getting into people's dreams and using
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. These talents seem to go together, and all three of them are still alive as of
*Towers of Midnight*
(out of five remaining Forsaken).
