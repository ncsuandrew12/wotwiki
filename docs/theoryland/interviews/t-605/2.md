# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#2)

#### Terez

Demandred mentions that the sleepweavers are used to train beginners in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Can any channeler be trained to enter without a
*ter'angreal*
(eventually) or is a certain amount of Talent required?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(long silence) I believe...I'll give you a percentage on these. If I say, "I believe", it means, "this is my understanding, but, um..."

#### Terez

Right, the asterisk.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's an asterisk on it. And most of my understanding is informed by the notes and what I've read, but I often get things mixed up. So, I'm going to say on a 75% surety, not everybody can be trained to enter without a
*ter'angreal*
eventually, and some talent is required, but there are some who can...there is a middle ground between, for instance, Egwene, and somebody who can't at all.

#### Terez

Like Aran'gar, who obviously has hardly any talent at all, but she can get into people's dreams.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So, there is a middle ground. But I don't believe everybody can.

#### Terez

Have all of the Forsaken been trained to do this or do some of them have to use gateways to get there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In choosing the Forsakenâ€”and this one is actually, um...I am quoting sources that you don't have access to, but I do...

#### Terez

Right.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In choosing the Forsaken, the Dark One was careful...um, the very nature of it led to people with great talent in many areas being chosen. They are extraordinary in many areas, and having talents that others do not have, beyond being powerful channelers.

#### Terez

We're talking about the thirteen that were at Shayol Ghul...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. ...This is what led to them being at the top of the heap. That said, I do believe that, among the Forsaken, there are some who had to use gateways to get there...but the majority of the Forsaken are very talented in many areas.
