# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#12)

#### Terez

Will we learn about the information exchange between Graendal and Mesaana?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Considering what's happened to Mesaana, I’m going to say that’s unlikely. No, that depends on what you mean by 'learn of'. If you wiggle it out of us, then perhaps some day.
