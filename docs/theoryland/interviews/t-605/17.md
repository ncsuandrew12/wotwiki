# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#17)

#### Terez

Is the sky clear above Alanna or only the harem? (Brandon, who was reading from my list of questions, refused to say 'harem' and said 'THE THREE WOMEN' before I cut him off with my uproarious laughter.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Was that yours?

#### Terez

Why is that offensive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What's that?

#### Terez

They are a harem.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Terez

They are!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Noooo! Harem...I don’t know if it really does imply...but a harem implies women who sit around and do nothing...

#### Terez

#### Brandon Sanderson

...until the man, um, wishes...

#### Terez

It’s an affectionate name for them.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. But I have seen that um, that phrase before, and...yes. Is the sky clear above Alanna? I’m going to RAFO Alanna. Alanna’s got an interesting thread still, so...

#### Terez

Yay!
