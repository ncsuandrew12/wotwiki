If Taim already knew how to ignore heat, why did he shave his beard? (Because of the way he read it.) That's not my question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have no idea.

#### Terez

(laughs) I didn't figure you would.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a pretty random question. I don't even think that's in the notes; I'll be honest with you....that's really not the sort of thing Jim put in his notes, so I'm guessing...I can MAFO that one, if you want to ask Maria, but I really don't know.

#### Maria Simons

I don't know either.
