# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#7)

How much time passed between Verin's meeting with Mat and her death?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh boy, you’re fishing for Nakomi!

#### Terez

No, actually I'm not; somebody else submitted that question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay. I would have to have the timeline in front of me.

#### Terez

Yeah. I think they asked because there are certain contradictions in the timeline and that’s why...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah. There’s a mistake in Mat’s timeline.

#### Terez

And that was in
*The Gathering Storm*
, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, there’s a mistake in
*Towers of Midnight*
. Mat sees sunshine when he shouldn't, or vice-versa. The reason for that being, Mat's timeline was the big one we were playing with, and we were moving him through the book to different places to decide where various things were appropriate, and where we settled on, both Alan and Bob Kluttz—who are really detailed timeline people—both stamped this timeline and said 'There are no flaws in this except there is an error in
*The Gathering Storm*
', which we have now changed. But we let a typo creep through—that one was more of a typo because we moved a scene from some place to some place else—and so there is a cloud typo. It is recorded on Twitter—I don’t know if you saw it—where someone pointed it out to me and I said 'We will get that changed.' Maria now is aware of it.

#### Terez

If it was recently then I didn’t get it, because I’m behind.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay. But Bob Kluttz does have an official timeline...he was one of the beta readers. The betas have all kind of come out now. I didn’t want people being jealous of them before the book came out, but...

#### Terez

Too late. I already knew about Linda. And I was jealous.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. I went to Bob because Bob is a master of timeline—one of them; there are many out there—and Bob’s job was to keep me honest on the timeline, and he did a really fantastic job, but we did miss one typo at least.
