# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#31)

#### Terez

How does Demandred compare in strength to Moridin and Aginor? Sammael?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um...I have to have the list in front of me for that one.

#### Terez

Ahh.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sorry, Terez.

#### Terez

That's okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really want to just post that for people, because so many people ask about it...

#### Terez

Right, they're like really obsessed with it at rafo.com....

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, they're very obsessed with it, and the thing is, a lot of them are really close, and so it's a matter of a few points on Jim's scale...

#### Terez

Yeah, I figured, like what you were saying earlier about how they were Chosen because their talents...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Terez

...obviously they're all within...

#### Brandon Sanderson

...yeah. They're all awesome. And so, you know, you couldn't be a Forsaken simply for being awesome in the Power. It's like you had to be awesome at the Power, and be awesome at other stuff.

#### Terez

Well, I mean...that's what they said about Balthamel, that that was the only reason he was one of them, was that he was so strong...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah....

#### Terez

But, you know, obviously there was something else going on there...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. [I think he was already looking at the next (last) question at this point because we were nearing the airport terminal.]
