# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#25)

#### Terez

Can Shayol Ghul be reached in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm actually going to RAFO that. And that's actually not one I'm RAFO'ing...I'm RAFO'ing that for very good reasons. Not just out-of-hand RAFO'ing.

#### Terez

Gotcha.

#### Footnote

RJ
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#2)
that the Blight cannot be reached in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
because it's not a part of the 'normal' universe, but he never commented specifically on Shayol Ghul.
