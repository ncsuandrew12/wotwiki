What happened to the twelve Aes Sedai Siuan sent to recapture Taim? Their troops?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a great question. RAFO. That's a good question to be asking, though.

#### Footnote

This was asked because they match the number of Aes Sedai who joined the Borderland rulers. Paitar's adviser Coladara made the 13th.
