# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#21)

#### Terez

Who killed Barthanes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll RAFO that one, because I've answered a whole bunch. Some of these...I need to leave questions for people, and...you know...

#### Terez

Oh come on, it's not like...you know, there will always be questions.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There will always be questions. I don't want to look like a pushover. Jim wasn't a pushover, and I'm kind of a pushover.

#### Terez

I don't know. You answered most of Matt's questions, on his drive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I know...I know I did. Wait, are you trying to guilt-trip me now, that I answered Matt's?

#### Terez

No, no. (Peter is laughing in the back seat.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

At least this time I knew what I was getting into. With Matt, that was my first Theoryland ambush.

#### Terez

Oh really?

#### Brandon Sanderson

My first real oneâ€”my first real big one. So I guess I now need to have Emma drive me somewhere. And then I'll have completed the...who else is big on Theoryland. The one who was on the...the...

#### Terez

Ted.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Is his name Ted?

#### Terez

WinespringBrother.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah! Right, WinespringBrother, and who else? Frenzy. Yeah.

#### Terez

She was there last year.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The tor.com people aren't Theorylanders, are they? Like Wetlander and Freelancer...

#### Terez

No, I just know all of them because I hang out there sometimes...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, you hang out there...

#### Terez

Thanks to Peter. He sent me that way.

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Did I?

#### Terez

Yeah, you did. When you pointed out [Freelancer's] signing report that was there.

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Oh.

#### Terez

Yeah, that was the first time I went there, and I've been hanging out there ever since.

#### Brandon Sanderson

See, now you're getting into these little specific ones, that I'm...

#### Terez

I mean, you know...answer what you feel like. I was just collecting questions from everybody, so there's not really any pattern to it.
