# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#6)

#### [Terez (sleepinghour)](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=147388#poststop)

Is the weave used in the shawl testing a form of Compulsion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re definitely cousins. Whether they would consider it a form of Compulsion...to them, Compulsion is complete evil, so they will not view it at all like that...

#### Terez

Yeah, I thought that might be part of what Verin used to cobble together her own Compulsion weave.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. They’re definitely cousins.

#### Footnote—Terez

This question came out of a
[thread](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=4719)
I started on Theoryland, which in turn came out of a
[response](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#20)
Brandon made to someone on Twitter. I thought that Nynaeve remembering she could channel at all in her Accepted test might be related to her ability to resist Compulsion as she did with Moghedien (which, as we know from Rahvin, is a fairly rare ability possessed by only the most strong-willed, such as Morgase). Egwene's Accepted test is a whole different ballgame because of her Dreaming talent and the interference with the stone ring
*ter'angreal*
that Verin had just given her.

#### Terez ( [sleepinghour](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=147388#poststop) )

Do you know what the original use for the testing
*ter'angreal*
was?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The notes do. I don’t have it off the top of my head.
