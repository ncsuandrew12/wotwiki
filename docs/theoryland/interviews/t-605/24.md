# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#24)

#### Terez

Was Moridin in his own dream when Rand visited him in
*The Gathering Storm*
? If so, did he pull the boys into his own dreams in
*The Eye of the World*
, or did he invade and control theirs?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe Moridin was...okay, in
*The Gathering Storm*
, he was in his own dream. He at least believes he was in his own dream, and he is usually right on things like that. And in
*The Eye of the World*
, he...I believe it was their dreams that he was controlling. But...

#### Terez

That's difficult to do.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's very difficult to do....so I could be wrong on that. It's easier to pull someone into your own dreams, but it's easier to influence multiple dreams from the outside. So...does that make sense?

#### Terez

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, since he's doing it to all three of them, that makes me believe he was actually controlling their dreams. I'm pretty sure on that one, Terez. [Cut discussion of the pronunciation of Terez.] I could be wrong...but my understanding of the mechanics is that since they're all dreaming the same thing, that it's external, much as a lot of the Forsaken have been not warding their dreams through the early parts of the books, and causing people to dream lots of weird things, and share dreams. Ishamael was doing that intentionally...doing something similar. Does that make sense?

#### Terez

Right, and it also has to do with his ability to find
*ta'veren*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah.

#### Footnoteâ€”Terez

In my reread I noticed in
*A Crown of Swords*
Chapter 10, "Unseen Eyes", that Egwene says it's possible for a Dreamer to pull someone out of their dreams into a dream of her own making in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
; this is something the Wise Ones won't do, but Ishamael wouldn't have a problem with it; I had forgotten that detail for some reason, and the Moridin dream confused the issue. It can be assumed that Lanfear did the same thing; Moghedien has shown no sign of having the ability (or perhaps the desire) to reach others' dreams, but she can trap Dreamwalkers in their own dreams in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Aran'gar can do it weakly, and then only if she is sleeping right next to the person. Brandon has a point about the fact that all three of them dreamed the same dream apparently at once, but in once instance, after Perrin found the wolves, it seemed to Rand and Mat that they fell asleep, had the dream, and immediately woke up, when Moiraine says they were asleep for four hours.
