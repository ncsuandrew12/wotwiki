# [Interview #605: Driving Mr. Sanderson - Terez, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#27)

#### Terez

When Perrin and Egwene saw Rand in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
in
*The Dragon Reborn*
, had he been pulled there by someone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(pause) I'm a little bit out on a limb on this one, but I don't believe he was. We have seen places where Rand manifests in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
when he's in the real world, and this is something that happens with Rand that we haven't seen with other people...

#### Terez

Are you talking about like when...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, there's the Perrin sequence, for one...

#### Terez

Right, and when Ishamael visits him in
*The Great Hunt*
...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmmhmm.

#### Terez

Right. Cool.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, I believe Rand has got something a little unique going on there...

#### Terez

Oh, okay. That's interesting.

#### Brandon Sanderson

...but, I'm a little on a limb on that one.
