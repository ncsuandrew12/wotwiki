Jace has gained a little weight while back on Ravnica. He blames the Golgari. :) (And for those who don't know, that is indeed me in the pictures.)

The book picture is from a copy of
*Towers of Midnight*
I'd dressed up with an
*A Memory of Light*
cover on it. I let people use it as a prop in pictures, then at the end, was asked to 'edit' it.

Maaan, why you gotta sign with a Sharpie? My
*Alloy of Law*
book looks like you crossed out your own name. :-)

Ha. I was taught that 'name cross out thing' by an author right after I published. It is a kind of tradition among writers. Not a pervasive one, but it's one you'll see occasionally.
