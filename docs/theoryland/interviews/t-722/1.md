# [Interview #722, Entry #1]: Reddit 2012 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=722#1)

I have been reading the wot for more that half my life. I love it. I just finished my nth read through and let me say that Sanderson does an amazing job. I loved all of his books, if you have not read mistborn you are missing out. Ok that said I am fairly certain that the curse is "Blood and ashes" or in cases of extreme stress and/or Uno, "Blood and bloody ashes". Maybe even "blood and bloody flaming ashes". But NEVER was it simply "bloody ashes". Thank you, that is all.
Sorry for typos wrote this on my phone, while riding a raken.

It's okay.

I've done this intentionally. It's a personal quirk of mine from my linguistic background. I feel that many constructions like this, over time, will simplify. As the world of the WoT has been modernizing, I feel that slowly "Bloody and bloody ashes" would shorten. I've used the longer version in the books, but have begun pushing the oaths toward their more clipped versions as part of a subtle linguistic shift to accompany the birth of things like gunpowder and steam power.

Our world's own oaths have done this quite aggressively.
