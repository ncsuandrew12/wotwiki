Wow I am amazed that you actively Reddit, how in the name of the dark one didn't I know this? If you have the time I just have one question! Is WoT really going to end this next book? there seem to be SO many loose end that, if the series is tried too be ended in one book, will be rushed or left unacknowledged/uncompleted! Anyway thanks for yor amazing work I loved the latest books!

Well, I guess "active" is a relative phrase, as I only now saw this.

Yes, this is the ending. No, not every loose thread will be tied up. Robert Jordan left instructions for some to be left open.

It doesn't feel rushed to me, but we'll have to see what the fans think.
