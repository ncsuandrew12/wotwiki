Firstly, the speed in which this happened is amazing. Thank you for answering so quickly. When you started writing for the WoT series, how difficult was it for you to balance writing your other books along with WoT? If I recall,
*Way of Kings*
was released very near one of the WoT (
*Towers of Midnight*
?).

It was difficult, but not as much as you might think. I only did two projects during:
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Alloy of Law*
. For
*Kings*
, I had a complete draft done before the Wheel of Time came my way.

That said, I did rewrite
*The Way of Kings*
from scratch—and those were some busy months. I felt strongly that this was the time to put out the book, and so I threw myself into the work, but balancing it and
*Towers of Midnight*
was the most busy I've ever been. I never want to have to work those hours again.

*Alloy of Law*
was more simple, as I took a few months off between books and did some freewriting. This is what came of it. I often find it good to change projects between books in a series like that. It was juggling two books the size of
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
that was so hard.
