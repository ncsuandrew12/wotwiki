At the end of
*A Memory of Light*
, I assume you're going to leave some questions unanswered intentionally. Will any of these have canonical answers that simply aren't shared, or will you try to resolve all the open questions?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (August 2012)](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/xt5oy/does_anybody_else_think_it_would_be_a_cool_thing/c5pu98h)

There are canonical answers that are not in the book. (Mr. Jordan sometimes said in the notes "Here is the answer to this, but it isn't resolved in the last book.") He didn't want everything answered because he wanted the world to live on in people's minds. All major plot elements are dealt with, but some smaller ones are left open.

So there's going to be a new acronym after RAFO? Like YNFO?

#### [Question](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/xt5oy/does_anybody_else_think_it_would_be_a_cool_thing/c5rp3sn)

(Probably left this too late to expect a response but...)

Will you (or anyone) ever provide those answers? Whether it be by blog/new "world of RJ's WoT" or Q&A?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/xt5oy/does_anybody_else_think_it_would_be_a_cool_thing/c5tsks3)

I will try to answer some questions once the book is out. I'd like to do some blog posts talking in-depth about the process, and about the notes. But it will depend on a lot of factors.

Even Maria's large reference book won't contain those secrets?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/xt5oy/does_anybody_else_think_it_would_be_a_cool_thing/c5tsjbl)

The reference book will contain some of the things not resolved in the book, and I've given clues about some others. Other things...well, he wanted them to go unanswered. So they will be. (And some we don't even know the answers to.)

#### [Kooreth](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/xt5oy/does_anybody_else_think_it_would_be_a_cool_thing/c5uhwve)

Thanks Brandon! I am excitedly and sadly awaiting the final book. After so many years, it's going to be rough finishing it, and closing a chapter of my own life.
