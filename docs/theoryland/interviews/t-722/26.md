How excited are you right now?

Also, what are some of your next projects?

Hmm... For me, the excitement probably won't hit until the day of, but it will be mixed with a steadily growing sense of anxiety. It's the same anxiety for every book release. Will I have hit the target? Will it provide the right experience? Did I succeed or fail? These are things you can't know for certain until the book is out. It will be worse with this one in some ways, since there are no second chances here. Mistakes in earlier WoT books could be compensated for by future volumes. That doesn't exist for this one.

Next year, I actually have a few YA books coming out (projects I was working on before the Wheel of Time came my way.) One of them,
*Steelheart*
, I'm very excited about. I'm also working on a sequel to
*The Way of Kings*
.

Yep. Sometimes I just stare at that progress bar on your site, willing it to suddenly jump forward in real time. I can imagine it must be pretty bizarre from your end of things, having what begins as formless inspiration become quantified, written down, picked to pieces, bound, and then eagerly awaited by large numbers of people.

We're grateful for it though, those pieces of your brain. :-)

Need more Stormlight Archive.

It is very frustrating to get into a series at the beginning and have to wait for each book. I started WoT this year and ASOIAF last year, so I avoided years of waiting. The Stormlight Archive will be the true test of my reading patience.

I'm working on book two now. Hopefully, the wait won't be as bad for future titles in the series.
