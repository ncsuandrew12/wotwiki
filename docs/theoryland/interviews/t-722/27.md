So, uh, how do you plan to manage sleep on the tour? You're going from Provo to Minneapolis—that's going to be quite the jump one after the midnight release.

Oh. And if you're going to be at the Roseville Barnes and Noble, try and scoot across the street to Source Comics and Games. It's an awesome shop and I think you'd like it.

They've got Magic cards, of course.

That second signing of the tour (after the midnight release) is always a tough one. In fact, I'll admit, touring is not my favorite part of the process. I feel it is important, however.

I (and we fans) appreciate your touring. The author-fans connection is important, and meeting said author is always a cool experience. I missed you last time you were in Roseville, but did catch you at MiniCon. This time I've got no prior engagements, and will definitely be there.
