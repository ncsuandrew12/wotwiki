Not that it matters to you, but that is a serious chunk of downvotes...

Interesting. I hadn't noticed that.

I wonder if I picked up some downvote bots at some point along the way. It would explain why even my simplest comments, agreeing or offering clarification, are each getting a handful of downvotes.

Either that, or they are coming from displeased readers who are downvoting my every post, regardless of content. There are those who feel I have ruined the Wheel of Time.

(And, to an extent, they are right—as anyone who would write these books who is not RJ would ruin them to an extent. There is a valid argument to be made that the books should not have been written, and that the notes should have simply been released as-is to provide closure. I don't agree with the argument, but I do see its validity.)
