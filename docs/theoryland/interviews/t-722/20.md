What's your favorite plot thread in WoT?

Tough choice. I'd say that overall, it was either the Perrin Two Rivers sequence or Rand in Rhuidean. I'm not sure if those count as plot threads, or if you want something larger-scale. The plot thread of Mat becoming awesome across many books is very well done, and I might pick that as a larger scale item.
