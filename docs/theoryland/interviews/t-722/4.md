# [Interview #722, Entry #4]: Reddit 2012 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=722#4)

#### [Necrosxiaoban (March 2012)](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/qbvhd/brandons_musings_on_the_dragon_reborn/c3wckfn)

I read the
[article](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/02/wheel-of-time-musings-the-dragon-reborn)
expecting Sanderson to share some special insight but that article could have been written by anyone :(

#### Brandon Sanderson

Heh. I can give special insight into the books I worked on, but as for the early ones, I'm really just another fan. (Well, okay, that's not true—but special things I know about the early books are not mine to share, by the NDA I signed with Harriet.) I also have to squeeze writing these into five minutes or so between drafts of
*A Memory of Light*
chapters.

So, unfortunately, with these posts you'll only get Brandon the fan talking for a little bit about why he likes each book. (Sorry.)
