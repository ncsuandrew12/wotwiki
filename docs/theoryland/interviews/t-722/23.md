# [Interview #722: Reddit 2012 (WoT), Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=722#23)

If you bought
*Legion*
hardcover, send me a picture of you and the book/receipt and I'll give you the e-book FREE!

I told people I was trying to figure out how to do this with
*A Memory of Light*
. I failed there—the publishing end of that book is too far out of my hands. I can at least do it with stories for which I own the electronic rights.

The sad thing is, this shouldn't actually be news. It should be the standard. I feel that publishing should have figured out how to make this work already.

The next step is to figure out how to make this happen for my Tor books.

As a personal opinion, how good do you feel
*A Memory of Light*
is? I feel like I've been waiting for this book since I was a child. As a side note, I just finished
*The Way of Kings*
and have been told it will be a 10 book series which makes me worry when it's done I'll feel like I do about
*A Memory of Light*
right now.

On
*The Way of Kings*
: If it helps, it's two five book arcs. The first five will draw to a natural conclusion. (Kind of how Mistborn one comes to its own conclusion, then two and three are in another arc.)

*A Memory of Light*
is good. How good? Hard to say. I don't know that any book can live up to two decades of anticipation—or, at least, I don't know that any book I write can manage that. I think it will hold its own with the other two I've done, and then will have Robert Jordan's own ending on it, which makes it feel RIGHT to me. I won't try to falsely inflate the book, however. I did my best with it; I hope it is a worthy capstone to the series. The ending sequences are majestic. Some of the lengthy war chapters may drag for some people, though.

Is the ebook date set in stone by now, or is there a chance of it changing?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ziymj/sanderson_if_you_bought_legion_hardcover_send_me/c653ql3)

For
*Legion*
or
*A Memory of Light*
? I guess I don't need to ask, since they're both pretty set at this point. I wish I could get
*A Memory of Light*
earlier (or at the very least, get an ebook sold with the physical copy.) However, I am not in charge of these decisions, and this book doesn't seem the one to use for rocking of the proverbial boat.

True, of course. Thanks for your interactions with the community!
