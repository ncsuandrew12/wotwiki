Silly Forsaken. You aren't supposed to be reborn. That's the Prince of the Morning's job.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dang. And here I'd been telling everyone that he was dead for sure.

Better go edit the appendix for Book 13 for the next edition.

#### moose\_man

Dear god. Dear god. Holy shit, man. Holy shit. You are an inspiration to me, and I look forwards to reading your contributions to WoT.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks!

Hopefully, we'll meet at a con somewhere someday and can have a game of Magic or two.

#### moose\_man

That would be incredible. I'm so psyched for
*A Memory of Light*
, obviously.
