# [Interview #722: Reddit 2012 (WoT), Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=722#2)

#### [elquesogrande (February 2012)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ox8ct/rfantasy_10000_readers_celebration_giveaway/)

/r/Fantasy is closing in on 10,000 readers and, to celebrate, one lucky r/Fantasy member will win a hardcover copy of
*The Name of the Wind*
or
*The Wise Man's Fear*
—signed by Patrick Rothfuss with a personalized message of the winner's choice.

To enter, simply put your favorite fantasy-related quote below. Don't have a favorite quote? Hmm...google one up or just write down something clever.

At an arbitrary point of my choosing on Friday, February 3rd I will tally up the total number of people who entered and use a random number generator to help pick the winner.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (February 2012)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ox8ct/rfantasy_10000_readers_celebration_giveaway/c3ksuq3)

So tempted to post a quote from the unpublished last book of the Wheel of Time here.

#### blowing\_chunks

Please do!

If you win, your personalised inscription could be one for the ages.

"I, Patrick Rothfuss, acknowledge that Brandon Sanderson's beard is superior to mine."

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. Now that might just be worth it...

Of course, I already have Pat's books signed to me. I don't want to take the chance from anyone else. More importantly, though, I haven't gotten back edits on
*A Memory of Light*
from Harriet yet—so any line I post could be one that she decided to cut, or one she found a continuity error in. If I had a draft she'd seen, I might actually do it.

Mat does say "Blood and Bloody Ashes!" a few times, though. Does that count?

#### shepherdless

If not, at least post a quote from another source. I find it interesting to see what one the best writers of the genre (not to blow smoke up your ass) favorite quote is.

#### Brandon Sanderson

From the Wheel of Time, it's Lan's "Portion of Wisdom" quote.

"You can never know everything, and part of what you do know will always be wrong. Perhaps even the most important part. A portion of wisdom lies in knowing this. A portion of courage lies in going on anyway."

From any fantasy work? Wow, that would be a tough one. Maybe Vimes on the economics of buying new footwear?
