Is there anything those of us not in the U.S. can do to buy/get the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue?

Okay, so it looks like Tor has managed to get hold of English language rights to the prologue in some other countries. It looks like the list does NOT include Australia/UK/Ireland/New Zealand. That would be because Orbit has the rights there.

This isn't my doing—my emails only went out late last night, and this would already have to have been in the works—but many of you should now be able to buy it on Amazon.

I'll keep working on the above mentioned countries. It feels like a strange thing to be fighting for, since I think the prologue should have been free in the first place, but it seems this is enough a point of annoyance for some readers that it's worth me pushing on.

I can't download it from anywhere, it seems. I wouldn't dream of torrenting this under normal circumstances, but there are spoilers all over the internet, and dammit, I have been waiting for well over a decade for the end of this story. I want as much information as I can get—to finish the story, to participate in online communities such as this, and to be able to highfive my bro because its all so awesome. Teasers and pre-released materials are awesome, but it really isn't cool that we have to wait because the publishers can't sort their shit out.

Here is my suggestion—Mistborn, post the damn thing on reddit, please. I cannot imagine that you are content to let fans miss out because of legal wranglings about copyright, so throw caution to the wind and fix this for your European fans if you can!

If it were my own book, I'd do so. It's not mine, however. I don't own it—and it's not just about copyright. It's about my respect for Harriet, and my word of honor to her.

I've said before that I am not, personally, a fan of selling the prologue in the first place. I don't like the idea of people paying twice for the same content. This choice, however, is not mine to make either.

The only thing I can think to do is personally contact the UK publisher, who owns the rights to distribute the book in English everywhere outside of North America, and ask if something can be worked out. I'll try. If I get anywhere, I'll post an update in

.

If you really want something to happen, you could also contact Orbit UK and ask if they'd be willing to let it be sold on Dragonmount, with the proceeds going to them.
