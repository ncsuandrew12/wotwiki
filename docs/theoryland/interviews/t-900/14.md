So, this is a silly question. I know fans of this series spend a lot of time fantasy casting the movie in their heads. I know I haveâ€”I picked Liam Hemsworth for Rand. Have you thought about that, and who would you cast?

#### Harriet McDougal

No, I haven't. I'm more interested in the words than in, I guess, the images. Once they're separated from the words, they're not as exciting to me.

#### Petra Mayer

Interesting. And I guess as long as it stays sort of on the page, then you can make it look however you want in your head.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah.
