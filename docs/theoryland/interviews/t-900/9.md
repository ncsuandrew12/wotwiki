# [Interview #900: NPR Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=900#9)

#### Petra Mayer

Describe for me the process. Tell me about how Robert Jordan worked on the books in the last few months of his life.

#### Harriet McDougal

Mostly by dictation. He began by saying something about the last book one Saturday night. And two friends were visiting us at the time—one who very luckily had worked in her past as a court reporter—so she began taking copious notes. I tried, but I was just staring at my darling and listening to the story pour out of him—I was no go at taking the dictation. She was, although she thought the hero that he was talking about was the 'Dragoon Reborn'. (laughs) Dragoons are big in Charleston history. And she took very good notes, and the other friend went out at midnight to buy a tape recorder. So from there on we were just recording him and going back with questions, and that's how he worked in those last months.
