# [Interview #900: NPR Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=900#12)

#### Petra Mayer

What's next for you? I mean, you are a professional editor. Is it time to relax, or do you have new projects?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, I do have a project. I have a neighbor who is completing a new translation of
*The Iliad*
. And that will probably be my swan song as an editor. And I did buy an embroidery kit, which I sort of haven't opened. Maybe I'm not really cut out to sit around doing embroidery. I did, when I quit smoking a long time ago.

#### Petra Mayer

You could make a Dragon banner.

#### Harriet McDougal

(laughs) Yeah, that would be a thought.
