# [Interview #900: NPR Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=900#5)

#### Petra Mayer

So what was your role? I know you picked the chapter titles, but describe for our listeners your role in sort of the creation and editing of the series.

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, in
*The Eye of the World*
in particular, in the beginning there were four boys leaving the village, but one of them didn't have anything to do. And my husband said, "Well, I had plans for him for the fourth book." And I said, “If you bore people, then there never will be a fourth book. Cut that boring kid out.” So he did.

#### Petra Mayer

Yeah. There are only three, in the final.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, that's right. The original cover art—the kind of brownish cover art that was on the inside cover—does show four, which is rather ghostly.

And another thing . . . Nynaeve . . . I helped him develop her by saying, "Why on earth is she always riding up there to talk to Moiraine? She doesn't seem to have anything to talk about." And I said, "Maybe she's trying to show her that she knows her way around herbal remedies." So a major piece of Nynaeve's character slid into place with that.

#### Petra Mayer

Oh, that she was the Healer and the Wisdom.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, the village Wisdom—for people who haven't read the books, we're getting into some detail—but you might be interested that the village the main characters come from has a mayor and a Council, who are all men. But the village Wisdom (laughs) is the wise woman of the village, and generally represents the power of women. It's a very egalitarian world as far as gender is concerned.

#### Petra Mayer

I did notice that, yeah.
