# [Interview #900, Entry #13]: NPR Interview with Harriet McDougal](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=900#13)

#### Petra Mayer

So here comes the silly portion of the interview. Well, it's not so silly—I mean, I guess you talked about sort of feeling like the characters were your friends. So who's your particular friend? I know I love Egwene. I always think I'd be Green Ajah, but secretly probably I'm really a Brown.

#### Harriet McDougal

(laughs) I'm a Blue. Robert Jordan looked a lot like Perrin, so I have a particular soft spot for Perrin.

#### Petra Mayer

Perrin is also the one whose marriage you hear the most detail about.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, I hope not our marriage. He said all the women in the series had a little bit of me in them. The evil women—that was taken from me saying, "You forgot to take the garbage out again." (laughs)

#### Petra Mayer

(laughs) Wow, I can't see Lanfear hassling somebody about the garbage, but I'll take your word for it.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, but that's how he felt—I was acting like Lanfear.
