# [Interview #900: NPR Interview with Harriet McDougal, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=900#10)

#### Petra Mayer

And I understand that he—the last scene, which I think you're referring to—he wrote that completely himself?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, yes.

#### Petra Mayer

Did he have that in mind the whole time? Because I have to tell you, when I got the book in the mail last week, I turned to the end and read the last scene. I'm that kind of person.

#### Harriet McDougal

(laughs) Yeah, I think he had it in mind the whole time—from before he started
*The Eye of the World*
. He thought very far ahead. I remember once we went out to lunch just after he'd finished
*The Eye of the World*
, and over lunch he wanted to talk about what would happen to a Maiden of the Spear who had a child. And that doesn't turn up until where? Book four?

#### Petra Mayer

I don't think so, yeah.

#### Harriet McDougal

But he worked far ahead. And he did have the overall arc of the story in mind all the time—think of the prophecies.

#### Petra Mayer

That's true, yeah.
