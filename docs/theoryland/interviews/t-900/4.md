#### Petra Mayer

How many books was this originally supposed to be? I don't think it was fourteen, right?

#### Harriet McDougal

It wasn't . . . it was six.

#### Petra Mayer

Oh, I thought it was three . . . okay.

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, Tom remembers three, but I remember six. And since we were living on my fees as an editor and my husband's advance money, I think maybe my memory is better. But . . . I could be wrong.

#### Petra Mayer

I'll go with yours.
