# [Interview #900, Entry #3]: NPR Interview with Harriet McDougal](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=900#3)

#### Petra Mayer

What was your first encounter? Did he read you a little bit of it? Did he show you a manuscript?

#### Harriet McDougal

He showed me the first half of
*The Eye of the World*
, and I read it. (laughs) You'll love thisâ€”as I was reading it, I said, "Well, when they get to Tar Valon . . ." He said, "They don't get there in this book, Harriet." And I just looked at him. (laughs) But by that time, I had called Tom Doherty. I was at that point editorial director of Tor Books, and Tom was the publisher and founder. I said, "You've got to read this one." He said, "Yeah, why?" I said, "Because either after eight years of marriage, I've fallen into the 'wife trap,' or this book is absolutely
*wonderful*
." So he did read it, and the second half came toddling along, and Tom did a wonderful job of publishing it. Really, when we talk about 'going the whole hog,' well, Tom Doherty went the whole hog and all the piglets to launch the series. And the rest, I guess you'd say, is history.
