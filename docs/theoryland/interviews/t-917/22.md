#### Question

In
*The Shadow Rising*
, in the Stone of Tear, Moiraine tells Nynaeve, Egwene and Elayne that she knows the face of her husband. She hasn't been to Rhuidean, or even to visit the Aelfinn yet. Does she have this knowledge from a vision of Min's, and if not, where?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, she had been through the twisted doorway, hadn't she? You're sure? Then I don't know, perhaps that one can be asked of Maria.

#### Footnote

Min thought about unfulfilled viewings concerning Moiraine in
*A Crown of Swords*
, and Maria
[later confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917)
that Moiraine's knowledge was as result of a viewing of Min's.
