#### Question

Regarding Gawyn and Elayne, among many readers they are two of the least liked characters on the Light side. Do you believe that Robert Jordan intended for them to be viewed with such negative reactions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Elayne, no not really. Gawyn, though, heâ€™s the Fallen Prince archetype. Everything he does comes up short, which leads him to just be trying too hard.
