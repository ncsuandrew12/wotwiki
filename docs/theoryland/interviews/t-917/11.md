# [Interview #917: AMOL Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917#11)

#### Question

Are Robert Jordan's notes going to be included in that encyclopedia/anthology you're working on?

#### Harriet McDougal

The notes? The notes are more words than have been published in the entire series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Harriet, did you hear that I tried to make one file out of the notes? Did Maria tell you? Earlier this week, I actually said people ask this all the time, I'm going to have an exact word count for them. So I took every one of the notes, and I compiled them into one Word document. It got to 32,000 pages, and Microsoft Word said 'I can't count any further', and my computer crashed. Thirty-two thousand pages.

#### Harriet McDougal

So the answer is no!

#### Brandon Sanderson

The whole series is ten thousand, okay? And this was thirty two thousands pages. It crashed my computer, Harriet, it was hilarious. It was at four million words plus counting, it was continuing to go, and then it couldn't go any further.
