# [Interview #917: AMOL Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917#35)

#### Freelancer

In the opening of
*The Emperor's Soul*
, I see a scene familiar to
*Warbreaker*
; the first character we meet is in jail. Was this "connection" intentional?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and no. Originally there was a prologue which featured Hoid speaking with the main character and setting some of the plot in motion, but it was cut before final revision. Also, it's convenient to begin with a character who is already in trouble.
