# [Interview #917: AMOL Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917#15)

#### Question

In the Mistborn series, I read on one of your posts online that you had a rough outline of how the series would have gone if a major death in the first book hadn't happened? I was just curious how that would have progressed if he was still alive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He would have taken over, because that character doesn't not take over. And it would have been a very different series, it would have been more heist focused, and not so much epic fantasy focused.

#### Question

Would he have finished everything up a heck of a lot faster than Vin and Elend did?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Worse, but yes. Things would have gone very differently, how about that? The reason I decided it couldn't go that way was because I think the series just wouldn't have worked.
