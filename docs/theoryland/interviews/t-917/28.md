# [Interview #917: AMOL Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917#28)

When Rand is exiting the tunnel into the Pit, if he had gotten a good look at the woman who spoke to him there, would he have recognized her?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He didn't get a good look at her.

#### Freelancer

Understood, but if he had, would he have known her face?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I should RAFO that, but no. She wasn't Verin.

#### Freelancer

Oh, I never believed it could be Verin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Then who do you think he would recognize?

#### Freelancer

A face from his visions in Rhuidean.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aha, very subtle, I didn't see that coming. Still no.

#### Freelancer

So Nakomi (and we're sure it was Nakomi based on previous answers from Brandon who said Nakomi could be found near the end of
*A Memory of Light*
) is not one of the Jenn seen by Rand at the founding of Rhuidean. She could still be another of the Jenn. For others attending an upcoming signing, consider how to follow up on this question and try to get something useful.
