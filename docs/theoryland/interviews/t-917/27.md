(I see you, s'rEDIT! And insectoid)

I was really amazed at how many people were willing to beat their brains against this stuff, but I guess it's better than boredom while waiting. I also had prepared some trivia questions for those who rolled their eyes at the "easy" ones. I didn't really think they were all that obscure, but only one person the entire night knew that Suroth's pet
*lopar*
was named Almandaragal. Nobody was able to guess my bonus question for the last bit of Tor swag up for grabs. The question: Who was the prince, murdered by a Black Sister in the city of Chachin?

If I'm not mistaken, based on comments farther below in this thread, Simka can be found in this photo, as well as insectoid and BaboKathy:

The San Diego Memory Keepers were all solid WoT fans, each possessing a strong sense of responsibility for helping to ensure all went well on the evening. A good team, and they deserve to be proud of themselves.

After this, Harriet said her goodbyes, thanked everybody for coming, the Memory Keepers for volunteering, and then bought a book!

Ok, no more stalling. Time to get down to it. Here are the potential spoiler questions I was able to get Brandon to respond to (all non-spoiler questions are included in the Dragonmount report) (FL = Freelancer, BWS = Brandon W. Sanderson):
