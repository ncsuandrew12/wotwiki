# [Interview #917: AMOL Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917#21)

#### Question

Was Verin involved in the attack on Demira Sedai in Caemlyn? If not, was it on orders from the Tower Aes Sedai, or Daved Hanlon, or??

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. There are plenty of "loose ends" that may end up in the encyclopedia, and this is just the sort that I don't want to spoil. There will certainly be some details about Verin in there.

#### Footnote

Maria
[confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#11)
that it was Fain's corrupted Whitecloaks who carried out the attack, so it's unlikely Verin or any of the other Darkfriends had anything to do with it.
