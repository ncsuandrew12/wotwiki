# [Interview #917: AMOL Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=917#29)

#### Freelancer

Who summoned Slayer to the Town and met him there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ok, I'm not sure I should give an answer to this one. Who do you think it is, what are you basing it on?

#### Freelancer

I'm pretty sure it's Lanfear. Several things. She's wearing red and black, and she doesn't have a Cour'souvra around her neck. Her appearance is unknown to Slayer, and she's pretty, though she isn't comfortable with her own reflection. She expresses disgust at having to use him. This eliminates Moghedien and Graendal.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But she's ordering Slayer to kill Rand.

#### Freelancer

This will lead into the next question, but I don't think she believes that Slayer can succeed, she's using him as a distraction, and to give her options, because she's playing a deep game.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ok, here's your answer. Your case is very, very, very solid, and you can stand by it.
