# [Interview #175: COT Signing Report - Neill Smith, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=175#4)

#### Neill Smith

These weren't your usual type of questions, but I didn't think I could ask one clever enough to avoid a RAFO. I hope these answers are of interest to you, and I really would appreciate it if you find out any thing about what is going on with the audiobooks. I make two 600 mile trips a month and unabridged audiobooks are my friends.

Thanks and keep up the good work.

Sincerely,

Neill Smith

Editor's note: RJ is pretty good about following up on things like that. When I hear something about these books, I'll make sure it goes onto our news page and into our newsletter. Thanks for suggesting to him that he contact Dragonmount!
