# [Interview #175: COT Signing Report - Neill Smith, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=175#3)

#### Neill Smith

My second question to him concerned the various songs that he has scattered throughout the books. I asked him if he had a particular tune in mind for each song, thinking that I would get an answer like "Jack o' Shadows is based on an old English drinking song ...", etc.

#### Robert Jordan

Instead, he said that he had tunes for each of the songs but that they existed only in his head right now. I asked if he ever planned to let us know what those tunes were, and he said maybe if he ever found time to put them down on paper.
