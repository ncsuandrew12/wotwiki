#### Question

Were you a part of any of the WoT online communities?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Usenet for RJ my first day on the internet. I was a member of Dragonmount and Wotmania, but never posted." He'd go to Dragonmount to check blogs. He'd drop by Wotmania, but they were kinda mean (aggressive about their viewpoints).
