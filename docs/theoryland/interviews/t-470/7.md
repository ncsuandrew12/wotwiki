# [Interview #470: TGS Signing Report - Tiffany Franklin, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=470#7)

#### Question

I am struck by how alike this is to Tolkien. Have you ever talked to Chris Tolkien (since he took over for his father using his notes)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but I'd like to.

We're in a little better shape. Jim actually finished scenes. We have a lot more to work with. He wrote the end himself! He left landmarks to follow from here to the end. Not specific details, just "strong stuff" to get us to the end.

"There are no characters that we don't know how they end up."
