# [Interview #470, Entry #5]: TGS Signing Report - Tiffany Franklin](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=470#5)

#### Question

How's
*Towers of Midnight*
coming?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Towers of Midnight*
is 70% done.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet's answer: "If I can quote Robert Jordan, I can assure you without fear of contradiction, that
*Towers of Midnight*
will be on the shelves very shortly after Brandon finishes writing it."

#### Brandon Sanderson

"This is a very, very...there's a lot of work involved. People assume that when I was given the outline, I was given a point by point outline. RJ wasn't like that. He wouldn't show it to Harriet until he'd done twelve drafts. We got this in a state of incompleteness. The creative process isn't as neat and orderly. Things were in dozens of files."

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Brandon would say "what order do you want it in?" and I would say "Brandon, you're the writer. It's foolish for the editor to take over the part of the writer. And vice versa."

#### Brandon Sanderson

He dictated some and the assistants transferred it into notes, scoured their memory for anything he'd said and put that in the notes. And then all the files... "this was all handed to me and told 'ok, let's write a book.'"
