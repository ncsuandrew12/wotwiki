#### Tiffany Franklin

I can't tell you the question, but I think the answer was insightful, so I'm editing out the spoilers to give you this:

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll notice that the prologues fulfill a purpose. Most of the prologues are written likean epilogue to the book before. [This Prologue] was more of an epilogue to the [end of]
*Knife of Dreams*
. Brandon believes that RJ liked giving his fans something to talk about and then answer it in the prologue of the next book. Brandon: "I can't speak for what Robert Jordan was thinking."

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

To which Harriet responded, "Even Robert Jordan couldn't speak for what Robert Jordan was thinking."
