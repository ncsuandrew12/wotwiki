# [Interview #831: KOD Signing Report - Jennifer, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=831#1)

#### Jennifer

I was at the book signing today at Chester County Books & Music Co. in West Chester, PA, and I must say it was vey enjoyable! The book store had a very nice set-up and copies of all the hard backs easily found if you needed any, with lots of copies of KOD.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ arrived a few minutes after the appointed time, but I suspect he was just waiting till everyone was settled in before coming out. He spoke for about 10 minutes, going over pronunciations of many of the character names. He then took questions from the audience. The crowd was not overly large, but I think that was a bonus to those of us that attended as he had more time to speak and spend with each of us individually as we had our books signed.
