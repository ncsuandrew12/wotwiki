#### PrncRny

How and when is the type of Misting you become determined? Can you tell what type of Misting you are before you Snap?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It's determined at birth. The cosmere by combining 3 aspects of self. Your physical self, mental self, and spiritual self. The spiritual self is tied to the Investiture of the world that you come from. When an Allomancer snaps, a piece of their soul is broken and some of that power leaks into them, giving them their abilities.
