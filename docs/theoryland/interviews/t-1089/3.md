# [Interview #1089: Idaho Falls Signing Report - PrncRny, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1089#3)

#### PrncRny

So Alethi hair "breeds true" based on the individual's ancestry, why then does Renarin have more black than Adolin?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

As with us regular people, different shades of skin can be had within the same family with the same parents, its just a matter of how their DNA falls out. No different here. Nothing special with Adolin and Renarin's hair.
