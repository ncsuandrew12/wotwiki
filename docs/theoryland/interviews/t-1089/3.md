#### PrncRny

So Alethi hair "breeds true" based on the individual's ancestry, why then does Renarin have more black than Adolin?

As with us regular people, different shades of skin can be had within the same family with the same parents, its just a matter of how their DNA falls out. No different here. Nothing special with Adolin and Renarin's hair.
