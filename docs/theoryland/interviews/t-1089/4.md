# [Interview #1089: Idaho Falls Signing Report - PrncRny, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1089#4)

#### PrncRny

Why is Breath not consumed in Awakening, unlike most all other uses of Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Not all investitures are "used up." Must like energy, it isn't typically created or destroyed, just changes form. With Breath, in what it's used for, it is just more easily and readily recovered than in other forms

#### Footnote

According to PrncRny the answer was a bit beyond his understanding of the cosmere, he may have not gotten the specifics but he tried to give the jist of the answer.
