#### PrncRny

What connection is there between Lifeless and Shard-severed limbs?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

They are similar, but different. With Lifeless it's due to the soul being drained away, shrinking to nearly nothing. With Shard-severed limbs, that portion of the soul is sheared clean away.
