# [Interview #24, Entry #20]: LOC Signing Report - Erica Sadun](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=24#20)

#### Question

What is the world called?

#### Robert Jordan

Earth.

#### QUESTION

What about Randland?

#### Robert Jordan

Chuckle.

#### Footnote

The fandom calls it 'Randland', but this is not very helpful since it is used to refer to both the planet itself and the continent bordered by the Aryth Ocean, Blight, Dragonwall, and Sea of Storms.
