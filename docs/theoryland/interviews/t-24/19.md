# [Interview #24: LOC Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=24#19)

#### Question

Isn't
*Lord of Chaos*
half of a book?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. He wanted to experiment. There's something else which is experimental, but he won't say what.

#### Footnote

I asked Erica about this concept that
*Lord of Chaos*
is 'half a book', since it was mentioned a lot in reports of the period. I told her I thought it was odd, since now (2011)
*Lord of Chaos*
is by and far one of the fan favorites. It's interesting, because the older fans generally tend to favor books 1-3, and Erica herself was most impressed by
*The Dragon Reborn*
. One has to wonder if RJ didn't slow down to show them what 'half a book' was really like (aside from being worn out after completing his
[six-book contract](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=9#19)
with book-a-year deadlines).
