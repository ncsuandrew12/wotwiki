# [Interview #155: COT Signing Report - Robert Ruckman, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=155#1)

#### Robert Ruckman

Here is some news that I picked up from the Jan. 13th Santa Cruz signing. I didn't have a recording device so I am paraphrasing what he said. On a side-note the entire interview was taped for public access TV. [Editor's Note: Very cool. If anybody has that on tape, please send it to us and we'll get permission to stream it online.]

They had fliers which stated that it was the publisher who set the rules for the signing, the book totals, hardcover etc.... The flier stated that throughout this tour he will be signing two per person, hardcover only and will not personalize them.
