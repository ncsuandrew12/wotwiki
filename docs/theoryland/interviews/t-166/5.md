# [Interview #166: COT Signing Report - Imran Safdar, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=166#5)

#### Imran Safdar

So those are the three I asked...overall, the signing was great. If you have a chance to see Jordan in real life, you absolutely should because he is a really nice guy. Also, while he doesn't do personalizations, I did get his wife to personalize one for my sister. She is usually alone by herself and takes great pleasure in talking to people, or so she did with me at least. Great site guys...keep up the good work.
