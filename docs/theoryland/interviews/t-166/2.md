# [Interview #166, Entry #2]: COT Signing Report - Imran Safdar](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=166#2)

#### Imran Safdar

The first question was if Jordan intended to kill Sammael at the end of
*A Crown of Swords*
or if he decided later on that the character was no longer needed and was in fact dead.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan responded that Sammael was dead as of the end of
*A Crown of Swords*
. Jordan felt that the character was a "louse" and didn't deserve a dramatic death
*a la*
Rahvin or Be'lal. He deserved a very vague death and was killed by something that he didn't pay attention to.
