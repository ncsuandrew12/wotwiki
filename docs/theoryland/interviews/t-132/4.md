#### Robert Jordan

Another question involved the Wheel of Time computer game: yes, he was involved in the making of it and has played itâ€”but not very often. He would have liked better and more extensive features like having the characters interact more with the player.

There were also questions about the language used in the book; he also wanted people to know about the card game etc. etc.
