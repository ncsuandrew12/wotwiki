#### Karin

His wife, who is his editor, came along and is a very nice lady. You just had to be there! I hope I managed to jot down the most important questions and answers to keep you Wheel of Time readers happy, at least ... for a while.

Some people (customers) came to thank us... Well, thank you for showing up and making this such a nice event!

Karin
