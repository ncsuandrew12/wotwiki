## [Entry #1](./t-596/1)

#### Matt Hatch

Some Background

Back in July of 2010 with the prospect of getting an opportunity to interview Brandon, I was chatting with Linda of
[13th Depository](http://13depository.blogspot.com/)
about Verin, a favorite topic. I mentioned that Brandon, during
*The Gathering Storm*
tour, seemed disappointed that fans were not asking more Verin related questions. And I had done a podcast on Verin with 4th Age which reminded me just how much we didn't know about Verin. So, after spending some time brainstorming question topics with Linda, I grabbed a few more HCFF's (Terez and Marie) to knock out a detailed list of questions. And what you will read below is the list of Verin related questions we developed hoping that Team Jordan/Team Sanderson would be more open to the idea of discussing Verin now that she had died. I'm a bit of a Verin freak, so this shouldn't surprise anyone.

About the List
  

After posing a few of these questions which were much more elaborate in their setup believing I would be interviewing someone when asking them, Brandon recommended that I send him the list and he'd send it on. It's been quite busy since then for Team Jordan, but Maria gratefully walked through the List recently and sent us back the following.

So...enjoy. Linda posted in tandem with us on this and spoke a little bit about the reasoning for some of the questions she cared most about. You can find her post here:

## [Entry #2](./t-596/2)

#### Question

How old was Verin when she died? If you cannot give us an exact number, is it correct to say that Verin's age at death was somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 years? If not, will you provide an estimate of her age at death?

#### Maria Simons

Verin was born in 849NE, making her 151ish at death.

## [Entry #3](./t-596/3)

#### Question

Merana said that every sister knew when each sister of the Tower arrived and how long she trained (
*Lord of Chaos*
, The Crown of Roses). The Tower keeps records on this. She thought Verin had been Aes Sedai about 40 years longer than she and Merana appears to have been Aes Sedai 70 years (their training time was the same and the novice acceptance age range is only three years). Is Merana mistaken in when Verin became Aes Sedai? Or in Verin's age when she came to the Tower?

#### Maria Simons

Okay, this one has me all confused. Can you expand this and explain? I should note that we have asked for a correction to one section in this chapter (I'll include it a bit later). Somehow I'm also missing where Merana says that every sister knows when each one arrived (I do see the bit about knowing how long each was novice and Accepted). Here's the change we asked for (it hasn't been made in the mmp I'm holding; I don't know if it was elsewhere):

At present reads: Alanna had been six years a novice, Merana only five, but more importantly, Merana had been Aes Sedai ten years the day the midwife laid Alanna at her mother's breast. Should read: Alanna had been six years a novice, Merana only five, but more importantly, Merana had been Aes Sedai above thirty years the day the midwife laid Alanna at her mother's breast.

## [Entry #8](./t-596/8)

#### Question

As far as Verin's recruitment and this statement, "I found myself in a position where I could either take the oaths to the Dark One, or I could reveal that I had actually never wanted—or intended—to do so, whereupon I would have been executed," how long after Verin was in contact with the Black Ajah for the first time, did this moment she describes occur?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## [Entry #12](./t-596/12)

#### Question

Verin makes many statements throughout the books that are suspect now that we know she was not bound by the Oaths. In regards to the
*ter'angreal*
dream ring, Verin tells Egwene, "I tried it myself, once, some years ago. Anaiya's Healing did not work as well as it should have. Remember that."

During the time Verin gave Egwene the ring she mentioned going to Anaiya to be healed. She didn't go to a Yellow for Healing—does Verin hold something over Anaiya? Were they pillow friends? Or was this simply a case of asking a friend to do a minor healing because she knew she would keep it quiet?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

? If so, how did Verin enter

?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

#### Question

Was Verin ever in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
after giving Egwene the ring?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## [Entry #14](./t-596/14)

#### Question

Verin tells Egwene she wasn't supposed to give Egwene the
*ter'angreal*
ring. Was Verin speaking about Tower Law in regards to an Accepted possessing
*ter'angreal*
? If not, was Verin speaking about the Black Ajah not wanting Verin to give Egwene the ring? If not, what did Verin mean?

#### Maria Simons

Did the Black Ajah know of the existence of the
*ter'angreal*

## [Entry #15](./t-596/15)

#### Question

It is clear that Lanfear is aware of the search for the Black Ajah, as she shows up in the guise of Else and points the girls towards a previously unknown cache of items supposedly belonging to the Black sisters that went missing. Were those items placed there by Lanfear? If not, who placed those Black Ajah possessions there for the girls to discover?

#### Maria Simons

A couple of other curious events involving Verin occur in

#### Question

How did Verin come to her knowledge of the symbol for the Toman Head Portal Stone?

Specific to the different forms of traveling by Portal Stones, has Verin ever been to a Mirror World?

#### Question

Did Verin know more about the chaos theory and the numbers of chaos and Perpendicular worlds than she explained to Egwene? If so, what is something Verin learned about these other dimensions and worlds that you can share with us, which has not been previously divulged either in books or by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

#### Question

During the trip by Portal Stone to Toman Head, everyone experiences living multiple variations of their lives, an experience similar to some the testing
*ter'angreal*
. Verin makes the comment after the trip through her alternate lives, "Though I never thought I..."? Please finish that statement for us...pretty please?

#### Maria Simons

No.

## [Entry #21](./t-596/21)

#### Question

Verin ends up in the Two Rivers. Who sent Verin to the Two Rivers?

#### Question

Did Verin's trip to the Two Rivers have anything to do with Verin's plans to betray the Dark One?

RAFO.

#### Question

Did Verin ask Alanna to accompany her to the Two Rivers? If not, why did Alanna accompany her?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

#### Question

Has Alanna been keeping an eye on Verin? After all, twice she went to the kitchens after Verin did, plus she went to the Two Rivers with her, and both went to Fal Dara.

#### Maria Simons

## [Entry #22](./t-596/22)

#### Question

Finally, regarding the infamous scene where Verin and Cadsuane come to a mutual understanding regarding Rand, was Verin considering killing Cadsuane with the "medicine" she had in her possession? If not, was Verin hoping to weave compulsion on her while Cadsuane was doped?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## [Entry #23](./t-596/23)

#### Matt Hatch

I think Maria enjoyed that way too much, but I couldn't stop chuckling when I went through the list. Although I would suggest that it seems clear that Verin's touch on this world has not ended and we may yet get many of these answers in
*A Memory of Light*
. If not, then the encyclopedia we can hope, at least those Verin freaks among us.
