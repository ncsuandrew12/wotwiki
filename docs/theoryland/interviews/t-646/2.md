# [Interview #646: WH Signing Report - Matt Peck, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=646#2)

#### Question

Is Sammael really dead?

#### Robert Jordan

In the words of the Creator, "Sammael is toast. The man is dead." He went on to say that wasn't it cooler to just say RAFO and have something to look forward to.

#### Matt Peck

I think he was just sick of being asked this one, so he spilled the beans on it. I didn't ask about a reincarnation, and he didn't say. I think that's a RAFO anyway.
