# [Interview #969, Entry #4]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Stormlight writing video & music + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=969#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the fourth of my
[Stormlight Archive volume two writing videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og6ysonrBJ4&hd=1)
, two of the included songs are the actual songs I listened to while writing. I've been able to include them in the video thanks to the artists,
[Ray Lynch](http://raylynch.com/albums/bestof1.html)
and
[Incendio](http://www.incendioband.com/)
. This might help you feel even more like you're looking over my shoulder while I write.
