# [Interview #969, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Stormlight writing video & music + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=969#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some readers have been asking if my book signings are spoiler-free. In general, yes. Spoilers are not allowed during the public Q&A part of the signing. However, I do allow people to ask spoiler questions when they make it up to the table to get their books signed. So if you haven't finished the book, don't listen in too closely to other people's conversations. :)

This is my last week on the
*A Memory of Light*
tour, and I'll visit the following cities:
  
Monday: Baltimore
  
Tuesday: Philadelphia
  
Wednesday: Raleigh
  
Thursday: Atlanta
  
Friday: Birmingham
  
Harriet will be at all of the events as well, and audiobook narrators Michael Kramer and Kate Reading will be with us at the Baltimore signing. Details are on my events page.

I'll also have at least two more book tours later this year. In May we'll have the
*The Rithmatist*
tour, and right now it looks like most of the cities I'll hit will be different from the ones that were on the AMoL tour. Details to follow.
