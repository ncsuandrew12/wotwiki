#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyway, I'm back and working on WOT Book Seven (almost done, actually.) I hope to be through Book Eight by the end of the weekend. For those who have been wondering, I DO intend to read
*New Spring*
as part of this. (I'm reading it after book 10, where it was originally released.) I've also ordered copies of the audio-books to listen to, though I understand that some of their pronunciations are off.
