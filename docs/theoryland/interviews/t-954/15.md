# [Interview #954, Entry #15]: AMOL Signing Report - AndrewB](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#15)

#### Question

Regarding planned future WoT outriggers.

#### Harriet McDougal

An emphatic no. However, HM did say there will be an encyclopedia (the original contract was signed with a due date in 2008). HM expects that it will take most of 2013 to put together and then some additional time to have illustrated. At this point, HM thinks it will not be out until late 2014 at the earliest.
