#### Question

How does BWS manage to distinguish his own style and writings from WoT?

#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS jumps between different materials/works as a means of taking a break. In other words he could not write the WoT novels (or his own for that matter) from beginning to end without working on unrelated writings. That said, BWS did mention the horror (his word) of writing both
*Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
simultaneously. This is why he could not work on the second book of the Stormlight Archive series until he completed
*A Memory of Light*
.
