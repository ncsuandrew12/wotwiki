Here is my summary of what Brandon (BWS) and Harriet (HM) talked about at the Philadelphia book signing and the Q&A session. I will only briefly touch upon the areas that BWS and HM talked about. (I believe it was stated that the session was recorded on would eventually be posted on the web site for the Public Library of the City of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania). However, do not take this as an affirmative assurance). When BWS walked on stage (this portion of the book signing was in the auditorium of the Philadelphia Public Library) he was wearing a black T-shirt with the blacksmith puzzle icon.
