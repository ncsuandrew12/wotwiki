# [Interview #954: AMOL Signing Report - AndrewB, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#14)

#### Question

HM was asked how, as an editor, it was to work with BWS? Also how was working with BWS different from other authors and RJ?

#### Harriet McDougal

She stated that by the middle of the series, she would give RJ "curb-side edits" (her phrase) or if there was a "big problem." With BWS, it was a new author, but these were old characters. One of them told the story that she made the same edit for both RJ and BWS (
~~he noticed~~
that she is wearing...). Also, either BWS or HM told the story of the Aviendha/Elayne edit comment (that the Aviendha that BWS wrote was a great Elayne).
