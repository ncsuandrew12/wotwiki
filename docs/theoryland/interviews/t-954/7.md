#### Brandon Sanderson

BWS then went into the story of his response to RJ's passing, describing what he wrote about RJ on his blog and what RJ meant to BWS (despite not knowing the man personally).

#### Harriet McDougal

HM continued from her perspective. She informed the audience about how she came to read BWS' eulogy of RJ. It was the way he wrote and what he wrote that led her to initially believe that BWS would be the ideal type of person and writer to finish WoT. She also told the story about how she attempted to first contact BWS and wound up calling the other Brandon Sanderson in Provo, Utah.

BWS next told the audience about the time he first read RJ's notes. BWS informed us that there were about 200 pages of notes on the last book. Roughly 100 pages of these notes comprised dictations of scenes/paragraphs. The other 100 pages were from Q&As among RJ, Alan and Maria.
