# [Interview #954, Entry #1]: AMOL Signing Report - AndrewB](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#1)

#### AndrewB

I was at the Philly book signing last night. At some point I will post a summary of what Brandon & Harriet said prior to the Q&A, as well as the Q&As themselves. I took notes. I will try to do this later this week (probably either Friday evening or Saturday). RL will not allow me to do it any sooner. (BTW, I was not a Memory Keeper so I do not have that restriction.)

I was able to ask 2 questions: one during the Q&A, the other when I got my book signed. As a teaser here are those questions and answers.
