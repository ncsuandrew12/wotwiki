# [Interview #954: AMOL Signing Report - AndrewB, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=954#10)

#### Question

Which WoT character did BWS take the most liberties with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Androl. BWS told the story of how he asked HM if there was a character for which the notes did not have a role for and if BWS could make his. HM was receptive to the idea. One of them (I cannot remember who) mentioned that RJ had in his notes material on leatherworking. HM had asked BWS if he could incorporate this into the books. BWS felt it would be perfect for Androl.
