# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#2)

#### KuraFire

Ah yes, KuraFire asked about the prologue of
*The Eye of the World*
, where Ishamael Traveled, but with a different description than that of usual Traveling.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan said that that was because the Traveling was done by using the True Power. We'd seen the same since, when Moridin Travels somewhere..."The Pattern screamed."
