#### Question

A question about influences in his writing...

#### Robert Jordan

When I started writing I did not think of anybody as being an influence or an inspiration, in any way. There were simply stories I wanted to tell. Long before the Wheel of Time. I now believe I can see writers among my favorite writers, having certain influences on me, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, John D. MacDonald, Louis L'Amour. They certainly influenced me, but again not inspiration.
