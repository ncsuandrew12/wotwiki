# [Interview #136, Entry #13]: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#13)

#### Aan'allein

Do you ever talk to any other fantasy authors outside of work?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, sometimes... not often. They're a good distance apart. John M. Ford...

#### Aan'allein

Then he looked very closely at the card I had him sign...

Me: It's supposed to be Graendal.

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, well, it is...I just never knew that Graendal had nipple-rings, that's all. Now for once, it's just a thing I hadn't realized about a character in my book, that's all.

I see fantasy writers sometimes at conventions. And no, we don't sit around talking about fantasy. We sit around drinking beer, talking about contracts, mainly. And John M. Ford comes to visit me almost every Christmas, he's a close friend of me, uhm, almost as long as I've been married. [I think that was what he said.] And no, we don't talk about fantasy either. We talk about other writers, and contracts. When...has his book finished, that sort of thing.

#### Footnote

RJ has often
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=96#19)
that the common notion of your characters self-developing is a ridiculous notion, which adds a bit of extra humor to this quote.
