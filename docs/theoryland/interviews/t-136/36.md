# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#36)

#### Question

A question about how autobiographical the books are.

#### Robert Jordan

There is nothing in my books that I can point to and say, "that happened to me," but everything I write is talking about who I am. And who I am is a creation of all the things that have happened to me in my life. So you could say that everything I write was first shaped by my life's experiences. It's a rather tenuous connection, but that's the only one I can find for you, sorry.
