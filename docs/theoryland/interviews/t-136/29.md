# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#29)

#### Question

Why did he start writing, and is that still the reason he writes?

#### Robert Jordan

I started to write because I'm crazier than ... and I still am. [laughter] ... I knew at the age of five that I would write one day. One day I always was a ferocious little monster. That is to say, when I was five years old, my world view was equivalent to that of the average of a twenty-two or twenty-five year old. I had the life-experience of a five year old, but I had the way of looking at things of a twenty-five year old, and I looked at myself and I thought, "well, I can't be writing." No, I'll write one day, but for me to be writing now would be ridiculous. I'm a kid. and when I was a teenager, it was the same thing. I hadn't seen anything, I hadn't done anything.

#### Aan'allein

Okay, this simply isn't possible anymore. I'll just tell in general what else he said...

#### Robert Jordan

He finally started writing when he was in hospital some years later, realizing that life was too short. And that still is the reason he writes. Life is too short to waste on things he doesn't want to do.
