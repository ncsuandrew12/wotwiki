# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#35)

#### Question

Have you visited many WoT websites on the internet?

#### Robert Jordan

I do not regularly spend time visiting websites, though. When I sit down at my desk, I'm looking at my computer. When I'm looking at my computer, I think of what I can do with the computer, how I can best use it, and the answer to all these questions comes back: write! So, I have visited some, but it's not a regular thing.
