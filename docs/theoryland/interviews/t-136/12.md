#### Question

Is Sammael dead dead, or 'he will never return' dead?

#### Robert Jordan

Sammael? [pronounce something like Sam-my-el] Sammael is dead. He's dead. He could be reborn. In another life. Without knowing anything of Sammael. He's not going to be reincarnated, he's not going to show up again.
