#### Robert Jordan

The reason he did
*New Spring*
was circumstance. Bob Silverberg called him and asked him to do it. He would have said no, except that he had just the day before finished his notes on Moiraine and Lan meeting each other. Those notes had to be shortened to write the story, though. If he'd written
*New Spring*
using everything from those notes, it would have been 90,000 words, rather than the 35,000 it's now. (And the idea was: if you get to more than 25,000 words, call Bob immediately!) He's not planning on writing other short stories, but things might just happen in such a way that he will anyway.
