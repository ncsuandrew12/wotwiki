#### Question

In the Guide, there's this song from the Ogier about clear the fields, smooth it low...here the towering trees will grow. Is this sung when
*stedding*
are created?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Question

So, when is it sung?

#### Robert Jordan

It's sung...uhm, it's just a work song. As it is now. It used to be something more. But now it's just a work song.

#### Question

What did it used to be?

#### Robert Jordan
