# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#17)

#### Question

There was a question about if his characters ever managed to surprise him. [A pretty valid question, as authors like Maggie Furey and Robin Hobb are constantly brought in problems by their characters being so vivid for them that they do things the author doesn't want them to do.]

#### Robert Jordan

No. I'm the writer. I'm supposed to be a professional at this. I am not tap-dancing around blind. I'm not like one of those tap-dancing chickens, you know.

You know, I am doing something that, supposedly, I am knowing how to do. And if I surprise myself in any but the most minor fashion, then I must have been asleep for the last few days. And writing as a somnambulant.
