# [Interview #136, Entry #26]: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#26)

#### Aan'allein

For the past few days I've tried to ask you many original questions, but I'm sure there must be things you're never asked at all, things we really should ask. Could you tell us something about these things? And if you want to go off on any wild tangents, please do so.

#### Robert Jordan

[Jordan was repeating every question because most of the audience couldn't hear the questions] He wants to know... [on a tone that set people laughing already, then: louder, with a malicious gleam in his eyes]
*Sander wants to know*
whether there are questions that I think fans should ask me, and haven't been asking. [more laughter]

Sander...I am not going to tell you what sort of underwear I'm wearing. [spontaneous applause] There are very few questions that fans have not asked me. There are many questions that fans have asked me that I have not answered. There are a number of questions that fans have asked me that have made me blush. There are one or two questions that fans have asked me that have made me require smelling-salt to get out of the room on my feet.

No, I am not going to give you more ammunition. You know, this is like the
*Calvin & Hobbes*
strip. I've just been assaulted with snowballs all the way from the sidewalk, and when I manage to reach the door, a voice calls out to me, "Hey, come out here and help us make some more snowballs!"
