#### KuraFire

Can burned out channelers still sense the Source? (This was because of that debate that pops up every now and then, where because of that one glossary entry people just won't believe that burning out and stilling really aren't synonyms. From now on this should be settled forever.)

#### Robert Jordan

Ah, burned out? No. The difference between being burned out and being stilled... We use the term as if it is interchangeable, but they aren't. Technically, "stilled" means something that is being done to you deliberately. "Burned out" is an injury that you received accidentally.

#### Question

Is it the difference between a clean cut and a cauterized wound? (From memory, the background noise here got too loud for my memo-recorder; a problem throughout this signing.)

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, and if you're burned out, you cannot sense the Source.
