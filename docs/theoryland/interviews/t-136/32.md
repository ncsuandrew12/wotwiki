#### Question

Will there be more talk about necklines?

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan answered something about it only being natural that men will notice such things. If a man sees a woman, the odds are that he'll notice things like her legs, and her mouth and her bosom. And women will notice necklines as well, usually thinking other things like, "could I wear that?"
