# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#30)

#### Robert Jordan

He was talking about the ending again, and that nobody knows it except for him. But this time he once again said that not even Harriet knows it.

#### Aan'allein

If it wasn't for the fact that others also had heard him say last Wednesday that Harriet did know the ending I'd really be doubting myself now.
