# [Interview #136: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#25)

#### Question

How closely are you involved in the role-playing game of the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

I assume you mean the work of Wizards of the Coast, the Dungeons & Dragon type game?

#### Questioner

Yeah.

#### Robert Jordan

Uhm, I really don't know how closely involved I am, to tell you the truth. I told them I want to be, I want to have approval. I want to be involved from the earliest stages and beyond. As near as I can tell, so far that's resulted in me being sent a table of contents. I haven't seen anything else. We'll see what happens, I don't know.
