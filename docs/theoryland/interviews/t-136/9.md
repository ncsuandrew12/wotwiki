# [Interview #136, Entry #9]: Elf Fantasy Fair - Aan'allein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=136#9)

#### Isabel

Can you eliminate a few suspects of who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

No. No, I refuse to... Well, I'll tell you this. It wasn't Rand. [Seems he isn't even aware of the idea that Lews Therin Telamon taking over Rand killed Asmodean. Scratch one idea there.] But I have my suspicions about Nynaeve. And I've always thought that Elayne might have been covering up something that was going on at the site.

#### Comment

It was Bela.

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, you're one of those people who believe Bela is a Darkfriend, are you?

#### Comment

No, she's the Creator herself.

#### Robert Jordan

No no, there's a whole body of thought, a whole body of writing on the net, proving that Bela is indeed a Darkfriend, and possibly an avatar of the Dark One himself.

#### KuraFire

We have the proof that Bela is the Creator.

#### Robert Jordan

You'll have to put it on the net then. [\*blinks\* Jordan isn't aware of Larry Homer's essay? What a pity indeed. Seems like he's still thinking as they did back when the "where was Bela during
*Lord of Chaos*
?" contests were held on rasfwr-j.]

#### KuraFire

It is.

#### Isabel

How about the idea that Moridin is the horse of Rand?

#### Robert Jordan

No, actually Moridin is hiding as Nynaeve. [And yes, choosing Nynaeve there was deliberate; poor Isabel.]

#### Footnote

The bit about 'the horse of Rand' is referring to the prophecy in which Rand rides a white horse, the name of which is Death.
