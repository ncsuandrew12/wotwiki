#### KuraFire

Just one other question. Does Slayer know every Forsaken?

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, he does.

#### Question

Have all the Forsaken heard of Slayer?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, they've heard of him. Slayer is not old in the way they are. Slayer does not come the Age of Legends, Slayer is something much newer. Slayer is also known by all Forsaken.
