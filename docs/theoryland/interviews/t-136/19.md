#### Question

I don't remember what exactly lead to the following two pieces...they could even be part of the same answer to one question... [first question appears to be about what sorts of things he's currently reading]

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I read a lot of things. Just finished Stephen King's
*Dreamcatcher*
[guess this past week really is playing havoc on his "one book a day" average], just started
*Big Chief Elizabeth*
, about the development of the English colonies. Prior to that Sammuel's Lutbang [??? any suggestions for this?] about the development of the Dutch-East-India trade. The Lutbang trade. [Ah, there's that word again. I know I should recognize this, but my mind still doesn't want to cooperate...] I read a lot of things. I was reading some... The stack of books that I've finished reading since getting to Amsterdam includes, let's see, four medieval mystery novels, one contemporary mystery of 'aran shames' [??? suggestions? I really know nothing about mysteries] And that's about it, because I haven't had that much time for reading.
