#### Ernest Lilley

Speaking of world building, the world, and the magic of The Wheel of Time universe is quite involved, quite complex...yet you keep a high degree of consistency. How do you keep things straight?

#### Robert Jordan

Every time I think of something new I jot it down in my notes. And I've built a sort of logic tree...if this is so and that is so, then this other thing cannot be so. Sometimes you reach a point where if you follow one line a thing cannot be so, but if you follow another it must be so.

#### Ernest Lilley

So, you write fantasy "with the net up"?

#### Robert Jordan

I look at the magic as though it were technology in a way...as though it were science. The One Power and channeling follow rules...it's not simply free-wheeling and 'anything goes'; it follows specific rules. Those rules are pretty well worked out now.
