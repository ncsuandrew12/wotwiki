#### Ernest Lilley

When did you start in as a full-time writer?

#### Robert Jordan

That was about twenty-five years ago. I was working as an engineer for the government and I was injured. I had to have my knee rebuilt, and there were complications from the surgery. A blood clot broke up in my lungs and kept me in the hospital for a month. Some sort of infection that gave me a fever. They tell me I almost died, and I decided that life was too short. I had always thought I'd write one day, but I decided that it was time to put up or shut up.

#### Ernest Lilley

When did you first start thinking you'd write?

#### Robert Jordan

When I was five. I learned to read very early. At five I was reading Jules Verne and Mark Twain. I had read
*Tom Sawyer*
and
*Huckleberry Finn*
, and
*From the Earth to the Moon*
, those were the last three books I had read and I propped them up on a table an looked at them and I remember thinking that someday I would make stories like this.
