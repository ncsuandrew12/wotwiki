Does touring cut into your writing time?

#### Robert Jordan

No, not really. It's so quick after the books. The last five books it's been two months between me handing in the manuscripts and me being on tour.

I just have time to catch my breath after stopping writing and to go outside blinking a little because I'm unused to being in the daylight. Last year I figured out that I took five days off all year. The rest of the time I wrote. Two of those were days to go fishing, and there was a wedding, and I can't remember what the fifth one was...
