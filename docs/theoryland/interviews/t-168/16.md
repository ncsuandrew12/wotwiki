#### Ernest Lilley

Is there anything else we should talk about?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, no...except to once again emphasize that you cannot start with
*Crossroads of Twilight*
. You must begin with
*The Eye of the World*
(laughs).

#### Ernest Lilley

And
*The Eye of the World*
can stand on its own.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, and you don't have to go on, but it is the beginning and you learn things. I don't try to repeat the character's lessons. I simply assume in the later books that you have read what has gone before. You will know.
