#### Ernest Lilley

You have another couple weeks left on your tour, does this make up for the isolation of writing?

#### Robert Jordan

Not quite a couple, only nine days, and it more than makes up for it. It's fun. I've had a couple of crowds of over 600, and several from 500 to 300, so believe me, I get a lot of company on the road.

#### Ernest Lilley

Do you get starved for company when you write? I know you work for eight hours a day.

#### Robert Jordan

At least eight, sometimes nine or ten. No, I don't get starved for it. My wife says I'm a badger. She has to winkle me out of my den to get me to go to social functions.
