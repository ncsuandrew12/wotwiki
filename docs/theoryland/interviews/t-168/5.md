#### Ernest Lilley

You've said a number of times that you had envisioned the final scene in The Wheel of Time saga even before you started.

#### Robert Jordan

The scene was part of what made me realize the book. I had thought of how to open it, and then how to end the story. So from there it was a matter of figuring out how the people in the first scene become the people in the last scene, because they are quite different.

#### Ernest Lilley

It seems like a tremendous job to keep herding the characters towards that scene. Some people's characters have a mind of their own.

#### Robert Jordan

My characters do what I want. When it comes to my writing I'm an Old Testament God with my fist in the middle of my characters' lives. They do what I want them to do. The difficulty has been that the story turned out to be larger than I thought it was, quite simply. I thought I could put x amount of the story in the first book and I couldn't. Then when I started
*The Eye of the World*
I thought I'd be able to put more of the story in it...and I couldn't. It simple was a matter of size. These are fairly large books, seven hundred pages in hardback. It would simply make the books too large for anyone to carry without a shoulder strap.

#### Ernest Lilley

So it's not that the plot weaves in other directions than you expected, but that it's richer than you realized.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, exactly.
