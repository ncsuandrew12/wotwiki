#### Ernest Lilley

*Crossroads of Twilight*
is book ten in the Wheel of Time series. The idea of reading all ten daunts me.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, don't let it. You can give it a try and see how you like it, but you must start with book one,
*The Eye of the World*
. You would be absolutely lost trying to start with the most recent book, but
*The Eye of the World*
has a completeness to it so that unlike the other books it really can stand alone. So, even if you decide not to read on, it makes sense on its own.
