#### Ernest Lilley

For a few books you've been saying there were only three more books left...how many are there now?

#### Robert Jordan

At least two. I keep saying I was certain there were only two more books, and I'm certainly going to try to do it in two, but very few of the fans seem to believe I'll be able to do it in two, and I'm not certain myself.
