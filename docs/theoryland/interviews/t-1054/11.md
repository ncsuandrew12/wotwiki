# [Interview #1054, Entry #11]: JordanCon 2014: WoT Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1054#11)

#### Matt Hatch

Okay, so I had to write this down because . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah, so you’d make sure.

#### Matt Hatch

We know there are spirit-like entities tied to the call of a musical instrument. And we also know the mechanism Robert Jordan created—a super AI-like system, if you will, to guide the outcome of the many variations of all worlds. Finally, we know this super AI can upgrade the status of spirit-like entities as it needs. Therefore, has the super AI tied any female spirit-like entities of individuals who died during the fifty years prior to the final military engagement of the final book to the call of this said musical instrument? [Much clapping.]

#### Jen Halbman

Arbitrary decision . . . you win!

#### Leigh Butler

Matt, you have to send that to me . . . [?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, as a subset of paragraph 3, subsection B on the R. A. F. O. Rules of Engagement, this is definitely a Class A Read and Find Out.

#### Jason Denzel

Does he get a card?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I’ve got a . . . he’s got so many cards. Yeah, I cannot answer that.

[Question about what Matt asked]

#### Brandon Sanderson

As I interpreted it, he asked if any women have been tied to the Horn of Valere in the last fifty years. Any women who were not previously tied to it. And so, I can speak of only one person that has been tied to the Horn of Valere in the last fifty years. Male, yes.

#### Question

Who is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was Jain Farstrider.

#### Question

You’re not allowed to talk about it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can’t talk about it. You can interpret that as . . . Now I did preface this all by saying, “Here are the things that I won’t talk about.” So, you can kind of assume that if I can’t talk about it it’s because I don’t know, or I’m holding it back because it might be in the encyclopedia, or things like this.
