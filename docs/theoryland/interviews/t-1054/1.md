# [Interview #1054: JordanCon 2014: WoT Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1054#1)

#### Terez

This panel had strange rules. They tried to mix it up a bit by disallowing WoT world words, proper nouns and the like, so all of the questions beat around the bush. But Brandon was allowed to say whatever he wanted. We missed recording the intro commentary, my question, and the beginning of Brandon's answer. [There was a guy taking video in the front row, so if he ever sees this and hollers, or if I ever find it on YouTube, I'll update the transcript.]
