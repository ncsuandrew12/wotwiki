# [Interview #1083: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#10)

#### Jeremy

We know that Mistborn needed to Snap, and Surgebinders needed have the cracks in their souls filled. But what about the people in
*Warbreaker*
or
*Elantris*
? Is cracking and snapping only required on certain worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

This is universal to the cosmere; however, in certain magic systems / on certain worlds, this is easier than others.
