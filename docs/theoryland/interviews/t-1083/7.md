# [Interview #1083: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#7)

#### Jeremy

When Honor speaks of his inability to see the future, he likens it to a shattering window. Is this related to the fact that in the not-too-distant future, he himself will be splintered? Or is it more a matter of Intent; e.g., Cultivation (and Preservation?) is geared toward future development, whereas Honor is geared toward current behavior.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

This is not related to his impending splintering, it is a matter of differing Intents.
