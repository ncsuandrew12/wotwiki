# [Interview #1083: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#2)

#### Jeremy

How much can you explain about Dalinar's armor and how he was able to "mentally unlatch his gauntlet"?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

This is definitely something a regular person couldn't do with regular armor. You can see in his visions hints of how the armor used to work. This is similar to Shardblades, and more will be revealed later.
