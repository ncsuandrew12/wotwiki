#### Jeremy

What are the pre-requisites for someone becoming Returned? Does it depend on how much Breath they have?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It does not depend on the quantity of breath, but I'm not revealing the specific pre-requisites, since I need to save something for Nightblood.
