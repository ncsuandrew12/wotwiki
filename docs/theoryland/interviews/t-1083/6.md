# [Interview #1083, Entry #6]: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#6)

#### Jeremy

Does Wit specifically treat people differently when he knows they're going to have a spren bond? (E.g. Renarin, Dalinar)

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, Wit treats people differently, but it is not because of present or nascent spren bonds. He has an opinion of what each person needs to hear. He isn't always correct in this opinion, but he tries to give people what he thinks they need. In Dalinar's case, he simply has too much respect for the man to be glib. In Renarin's case, he believes that the boy has had more than enough breaking down, and is much more in need of building up.
