# [Interview #1083: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#9)

#### Jeremy

Syl gives Kaladin the choice to have any number of weapons or a shield. Pattern can be equally a sword or a small knife. Are spren limited to being items of war or could they be put to other uses? Could the surge binders less geared toward battle use their spren to make ladders, rope, etc?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

No, this is not restricted to articles of war.
