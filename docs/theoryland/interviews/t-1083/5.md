# [Interview #1083: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#5)

#### Jeremy

Is the order of the Ideals fixed? E.g. does Kaladin have to say the Windrunner Ideals in a specific order, or are they situation-specific?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, the sequence is fixed. The oaths for each order are essentially a progression of understanding of the kind of person that each Order of Knights Radiant is trying to produce. The specific wording of each Ideal is not fixed, but the overall idea of each Ideal, and the order in which they are spoken, is.
