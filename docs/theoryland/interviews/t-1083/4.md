# [Interview #1083: When Worlds Collide 2014 - Jeremy, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1083#4)

#### Jeremy

What's going on with the Mistborn movie, and how can I get involved?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

One of the conditions I set for the movie is that there has to be an open casting call. The film branch of Little Orbit has purchased the rights. If they complete the game within 18 months, they can renew their rights and keep working on producing the movie; otherwise, the rights will go up for sale to someone else.

#### Footnote

Little Orbit is the company making Mistborn: Birthright.
