# [Interview #486: TGS Signing Report - kavorka, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=486#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ability to channel/souls. I think this has all been reported, but he stated definitively that the ability to channel is tied to soul. He stated definitively that the spark was not tied to the soul but could be affected by a specific body (i.e., just because you had the spark in one life, you could be reborn and just have the ability to learn.) He stated with 85% probability that strength in the Power was not tied to soul, meaning that if you were an uber channeler in one body, you could be weak in the Power in your next body.
