# [Interview #486: TGS Signing Report - kavorka, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=486#3)

#### Question

Trollocs. Question was how many Trollocs did the Dark One have access to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He stated definitively that there are lots and lots of Trollocs. The Dark One has access to either "orders of magnitudes more" or "an order of magnitude" more Trollocs that can be supported in the Blights (I can't remember whether there was an "s" there. Sorry). He wouldn't comment on how or where, but was very clear that there was going to be a big, big Trolloc army.
