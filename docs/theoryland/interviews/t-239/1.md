# [Interview #239: KOD Signing Report - Chris, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=239#1)

#### Chris

I just came from the book signing in Half Moon Bay and it was quite enjoyable. Mister Jordan is a warm, inviting, and well spoken man. He was looking well when he appeared, and I almost did not recognize him because he looked thinner and younger than his last book signing.
