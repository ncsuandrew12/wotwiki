# [Interview #239, Entry #3]: KOD Signing Report - Chris](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=239#3)

#### Chris

There were a few questions about his series, one that I asked was: if channeling was genetic, did the Forsaken need bodies that were genetically compatible for them to be able to use the Power?

#### Robert Jordan

His answer was that channeling is not just a recessive or dominant gene, rather both genetic and in the soul.
