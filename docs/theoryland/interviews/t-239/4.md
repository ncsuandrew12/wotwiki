# [Interview #239: KOD Signing Report - Chris, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=239#4)

#### Question

Another interesting question was about the scene with all the flies in the house in book two.

#### Robert Jordan

This scene where Rand sees the same thing over and over again was actually Fain's doing, a trap devised by him to put Rand in a time loop forever.

#### Footnote

The scene is in
*The Great Hunt*
, Chapter 10. RJ's assertion that it was Fain who set the trap was also reported by
[Caychris](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=240#4)
, who might possibly be the same person. (One report is from Wotmania; the other is from Dragonmount; sometimes people write separate reports for separate forums.) This Q&A was confirmed randomly on Facebook years later by the person who asked the question,

.

In Robert Jordan's notes, he explains that it was Lanfear who set the fly trap, and why:

> [Lanfear, of course, laid the trap for him in the village. None could trigger it but one who could channel. Her own test, perhaps, to see if he really is who Ba'alzamon claims him to be, or at least if he might be. If he is the Dragon Reborn, he must be, at least potentially, one of the most powerful channelers in history, and it would take a powerful channeler to escape from that loop. It would also serve the purpose of pushing him to use the Power.] (HUNT CONTINUITY 2, p. 12)

He also noted in the same file that Verin knew the Power had been used in that village:

> NOTE: Verin came through the village where Fade was nailed to the door. She knows Power was used there, but not how, since the trap was dispelled by Rand's escape. She would be uneasy about this, perhaps ask if they had encountered an Aes Sedai. (HUNT CONTINUITY 2, p. 1)

We are not sure whether RJ changed his mind, or whether he had forgotten his notes by the time he was asked this question and just made something up on the spot.
