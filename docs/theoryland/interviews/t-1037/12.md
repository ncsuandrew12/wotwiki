#### Question

What effects does being a Sliver have on a person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It can vary (on the Shard, the length of time the power was held, the power itself, etc). In some way a Sliver is someone who has had their mind, body, and spirit expanded due to holding a great deal of power, and then have had that power leave.
