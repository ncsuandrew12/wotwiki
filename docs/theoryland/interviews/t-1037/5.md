# [Interview #1037: Steelheart Signing Report - Argent, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1037#5)

#### Question

None of the Heralds mention or address the Almighty in the opening scene of
*The Way of Kings*
; it's a little strange, considering they are his champions. Have they seen or spoken to the Almighty?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, the Heralds have spoken with the Almighty. They also feel that what has been done to them is partially his fault.
