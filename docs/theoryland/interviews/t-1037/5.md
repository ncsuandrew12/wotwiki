#### Question

None of the Heralds mention or address the Almighty in the opening scene of
*The Way of Kings*
; it's a little strange, considering they are his champions. Have they seen or spoken to the Almighty?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, the Heralds have spoken with the Almighty. They also feel that what has been done to them is partially his fault.
