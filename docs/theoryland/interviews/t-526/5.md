# [Interview #526, Entry #5]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT Is Done](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=526#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyway, be sure to check back during this week, as I intend to make up for missed blog posts (sorry about the lack of those these last few months) by posting frequently this week. I'll probably do a few posts about
*The Way of Kings*
, which is only about a week away now, and maybe talk about the projects I've got planned for the free months.

Right now, my plan is to start on
*A Memory of Light*
on January first.

Thank you all for being awesome.

Brandon
