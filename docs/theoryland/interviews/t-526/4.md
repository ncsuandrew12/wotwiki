# [Interview #526: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT Is Done, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=526#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll post about what I'm doing, when I'm doing it. I'll also be taking some time to read, play some video games, and build Magic decks. I do want to give a special thank you to those who sent me cards during the last few weeks. I tried to thank everyone, and there are still a few I intend to post about, but some of the items that arrived from my wishlist didn't include a name telling me who originally bought them for me.

I'm intending to bring these cards specifically to Dragon\*Con and do some fun things with them. I'll post later in the week about it, but if you like Magic and are going to Dragon\*Con, we should be able to find some time to play. (I'm thinking of bringing an Archenemy deck and trying to take on multiple fans at once in epic, large-scale games.)
