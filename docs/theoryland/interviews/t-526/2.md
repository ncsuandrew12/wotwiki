# [Interview #526, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT Is Done](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=526#2)

Now to the main announcement, which appeared on my

feeds last week:
*Towers of Midnight*
, book 13 of the Wheel of Time, is finished. All of the drafts are done, the final revisions made, the book turned in. (And for those who don't watch Twitter/Facebook, we're hoping to eventually post a weekly "best of" or something here on the website for you to read through.)

Getting the book done on time (or, well, close to it) took a lot out of me. I was basically worthless Wednesday and Thursday of last week recuperating. And I'm not a guy who often needs to do things like that. However, I feel that the book turned out very well. The publication date is set for November 2nd, and at this point, there's basically no chance we'll miss that. So go ahead and preorder and make your plans to come see me on one of my upcoming tours. Things look good.

Now that it's done, I can sit back and look at the book as a whole. As I said, I'm very pleased with it. For months I've been telling people that I feel that in many ways, it's even more true to the Wheel of Time than
*The Gathering Storm*
was. I hope to maintain the pacing that made people enjoy
*The Gathering Storm*
, but at the same time
*Towers of Midnight*
has a much expanded scope than the previous novel, showing a larger picture and getting back to many characters who were ignored or had reduced parts in
*The Gathering Storm*
. Though we are jumping back in time for a few viewpoints to catch them up, it does also continue Rand/Egwene and other characters who had a large focus in
*The Gathering Storm*
.

I hope that you enjoy it. There are some scenes in it we've been waiting to read for a long, long time. Scenes that made my heart break to write, and others that bring a smile to my face every time I look through them again.
