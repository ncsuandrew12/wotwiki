#### Brandon Sanderson

First let me get to some quick updates. I've put up a few
*Warbreaker*
annotations:
[two on](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/379/Warbreaker-Chapter-Five)
[chapter five](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/380/Warbreaker-Chapter-Five-Part-2)
and
[one on chapter six](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/381/Warbreaker-Chapter-Six)
. Two new podcast episodes of Writing Excuses have also gone up, recorded live at Dragons & Fairy Tales bookstore. In the first one Dan, Howard, and I offer constructive criticism on several listeners' submitted first paragraphs. In the second episode, we discuss what to do with old material that you've set aside.
