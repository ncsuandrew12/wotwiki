#### Question

We've heard that, more likely than not, we're not going to see the outrigger novels that Jim had planned to write for various reasons, but will we ever find out at least some of the big story plots for that so we have an idea of where the Wheel goes in the future? Are we going to get any info on that?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

I think that's a RAFO.

#### Jennifer Liang

Would some of the material from the two prequel novels that Jim planned ever appear in the encyclopedia? Like, would the information like Tam's backstory be in the encyclopedia?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Possible. We'll see.
