# [Interview #603: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=603#7)

#### Ted Herman

Is the prologue going to be a real prologue that's kind of split off between the first two prologues?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Can you define split off from the first two prologues?

#### Ted Herman

Well, the second one was a true prologue, even though it was part of three books that were originally going to be one book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The prologue will be like the other two. In fact, we even still have several scenes that Robert Jordan worked on for the prologue, just like we've had in the previous ones. We've mentioned the bulk of the actual writing he did was on the ending and on the prologue, and I have been able to fit several scenes from what he did in each of the prologues, and there's still some of that for this one.
