#### Richard Fife

We know what Brandon's obviously going to do once the Wheel's done. How about the rest of you? Do you have any plans or ideas for what's going to happen once the encyclopedia is finished?

#### Maria Simons

Well, I'm working on comics and we're just very early still in
*Eye of the World*
, so if that goes on and on I guess I will actually still be doing Wheel of Time, just a different medium.

#### Alan Romanczuk

I've been looking into greeting at Walmart.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, I've been thinking, what would it really be like to be retired? Maybe I'll join you at Walmart.
