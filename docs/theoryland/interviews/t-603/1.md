# [Interview #603, Entry #1]: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=603#1)

#### Marie Curie

There was a panel on the status of
*A Memory of Light*
at JordanCon last weekend. The panelists consisted of Harriet McDougal, Maria Simons, Alan Romanczuk, and of course Brandon who was running late and therefore missed the opening bit. The moderator was Richard Fife, blogger at Tor.com.

So, this is a transcription of the audio file that I recorded. I imagine that Portalstones will post a video of the panel at some point, so I've only included the actual Q&A parts and have left out what I consider to be the extraneous bits.

There are no plot-related questions, but there are questions that touch on how much of
*A Memory of Light*
has been written, when it might come out, why the timetable is being slowed down, how not to edit a book, the encyclopedia and a possible timetable for that, what lies in the future for the members of Team Jordan, Brandon's writing style, and so on. There's also a funny story about how Brandon nearly spilled the beans about Asmodean's killer to Tamyrlin before
*Towers of Midnight*
came out. And of course the obligatory question about Bela.
