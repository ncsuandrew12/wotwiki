# [Interview #603: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=603#4)

#### Richard Fife

Let's get to the big question here, the title of the panel. The status question: where are we at with
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

2% done.

#### Richard Fife

How long do you expect it might take to finish?

#### Brandon Sanderson

About till the end of the year-ish.

#### Richard Fife

And, as such, when might we see it on shelves?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some time next year.

I can answer some of that a little more in depth. I am anticipating the length of the book to be about the length of
*The Gathering Storm*
. I am two-thirds of the way done with the notes with two of the three books, so that's a pretty good indicator. Because of that, I keep a progress bar on my web site, and every three thousand words of rough draft I write, I will increase that progress bar by 1%. Which means that you can know exactly how much is written. And three thousand words... I think in word count because I'm a writer—it's what we start doing—that's for a Wheel of Time book, that's like between half and a third of a chapter because Wheel of Time books have long chapters. It's basically a medium length to longer scene, but not a chapter. And so there are two scenes done. And you can go and you can look at
*The Gathering Storm*
which is about 300,000 words, and you can guess based on that, 1% of that is 3000 words.
