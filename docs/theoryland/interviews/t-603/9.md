# [Interview #603: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=603#9)

#### Richard Fife

Getting a little bit more back to the preparation thing, how are you handling the stress of you are now finishing the Wheel, it's not even another installment, this is Tarmon Gai'don. Is this any additional stress you're feeling, trying to deal with?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan wrote the ending, so that removes the greater bulk, I think, of that. There's stress to working on all of these, but I wouldn't say that this one has more stress than the others because my job has always been to get you to his ending without screwing it up. That's my job.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

And you're doing it. Beautifully.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But, you know, in my mind these basically still are really one book, still. And when I write a book, I divide it up into sections in my head, anyway. Right now, I'm not even writing that. Right now I'm writing the prologue. And that section will get done, and I'll write the next section, and the next section. And then I'll get to the section that Robert Jordan did himself, and I can put that in, and that's the ending. If I didn't have that, this would be twenty times more stressful. I don't know if it would be possible as a project if we didn't have that.

#### Richard Fife

That's good to hear. Alan, Maria, do you have anything, stress levels or anything that you're noticing, unique to dealing with the end right now?

#### Maria Simons

Well, after all the typos and stuff in
*Towers*
, I'm really feeling compelled to do my darndest to have the next one be lots cleaner.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Though we will say, we can mention that there were a large number of beta readers from the Wheel of Time community, that we can now make share our blame, because they missed them all, too.

#### Maria Simons

Oh, and I found one that—we had it absolutely perfect going in to Tor, but somehow a word just vanished into the ether.

#### Audience

Retire the RAFO cap.

#### Maria Simons

It will be retired, but not yet.

#### Terez

You'll still have to think, those things that aren't supposed to be revealed that you know.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, there'll be the things that aren't supposed to be revealed. And those will have to be kept close to your heart.

#### Maria Simons

That's not a problem. No, I can't RAFO, but it'll be okay—just, 'no comment'. I've been practicing that one.
