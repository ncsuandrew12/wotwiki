# [Interview #603: JordanCon AMOL Status Report - Marie Curie, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=603#2)

#### Richard Fife

We've actually heard Brandon's impressions of what he thought of the ending when he first saw it and read it and heard it. But I can't say I've ever really heard anything beyond 'wow' from either of you. So when Robert Jordan was giving you the ending in those last months, what were you thinking about just how he had brought it together, and how the twists were, and general feelings?

#### Maria Simons

Wow.

#### Alan Romanczuk

I was speechless. But I don't have many feelings.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

And I've known the ending for many years, and at the time I first heard it, I said, "Okay, so how're you going to get from here to there?" But that's because I'm an editor, and that's kind of a Darkfriend.
