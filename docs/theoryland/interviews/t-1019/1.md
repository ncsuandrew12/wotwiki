Regarding the Lines of Protection in The Rithmatist - is the protective field generated by them as the lines are completed, or...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As with most things in The Rithmatist, the lines' effect starts when the person who draws them imagines the effect taking place. There is a mental connection here. As you are drawing, until you are finished, there is nothing there - unless, sometimes, there might be if you imagine it to be there. The Rithmatist is (mostly) consistent with the Cosmere rules.
