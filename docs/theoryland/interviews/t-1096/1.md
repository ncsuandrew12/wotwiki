# [Interview #1096: Orem Signing Report - mail-mi, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1096#1)

#### mail-mi

Could you spike Elantrian-ness? Like, could you Hemalurgically spike Elantrian-ness?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Theoretically, yes.

#### mail-mi

Could you out of a Reod Elantrian? The zombie ones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes you could.

#### mail-mi

You could?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So what you would be spiking there is their connection to... to the planet, first. That's gonna be the big important thing. So you're going to overwrite your connection. Um, and then you're going to.... it's going to be a complicated process because you're going to have to spike the actual ability to have been transformed, that's gonna be harder.

#### mail-mi

Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Does that make sense?

#### mail-mi

Yeah, so it's gonna take two spikes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's gonna take two spikes.

#### mail-mi

Alright.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And you gonna have to get the right connection to the right place. Let's say you spike somebody from MaiPon, and then you spike an Elantrian, you're not going to be able to use it, you're not connected to the right area.
