## Entry #1

#### Drew

Does the Expanse of the Broken Sky refer to Taldain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #2

#### Ted Herman

How much area do highstorms cover?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ask Isaac (cosmere artist).

## Entry #3

#### Ted Herman

Why is Nazh short for Nazrilof?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a nickname.

#### Footnote

The silent h is puzzling.

## Entry #4

#### Alice aka Wetlander

Is it relevant that Lift was ten when she stopped aging?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It isn't a coincidence.

## Entry #5

#### Ted Herman

Is silver invested in the Threnody system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #6

#### Ted Herman

I asked for info about Hoid's silver sword.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verbatim in personalization: it is not invested but it has personal value to him.

## Entry #7

#### Ted Herman

Can Lift convert cremling shells to investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She can only convert what she is able to metabolize for nutrients to investiture.

## Entry #8

#### Ted Herman

Ym is confirmed to not be an Edgedancer. Does that mean that he would have become a Truthwatcher?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## Entry #9

#### Ted Herman

Why don't mistborn use aluminum vials?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because they are too rare and expensive, though aluminum utilization is increasing in the AOL era.

## Entry #10

#### Ted Herman

Has Dalinar been on the bondsmith path for a long time? How about Gavilar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes to both.

## Entry #11

#### Ted Herman

Does Wit know what became of Helaran?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on where Wit was, so maybe.

## Entry #12

#### Ted Herman

How long has Khriss been cosmere-aware?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #13

#### AndrewHB

Is gestation period for humans the same on Roshar as Earth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Basically, yes.

## Entry #14

#### AndrewHB

What is stick's talos?

#### Brandon Sanderson

To be the best stick it can.

#### Footnote

Before the Q&A, Brandon gave a talk on talos (sp) philosophy.

## Entry #15

#### Ted Herman

Will the everstorm only affect Parshendi or will it also affect those with Parshendi blood like Horneaters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #16

#### Ted Herman

I asked for a personalization with some autobiographical details about Lift.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verbatim:
Name: Lift.
Date of Birth: A number greater than ten.
Birthplace: With my mom.
Eye color: Brown.

## Entry #17

#### Ted Herman

Where did you get the name for David's crystal grower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I named it to annoy Peter [Ahlstrom] since he didn't like the names for Dawnslight and Harmsway. (paraphrased)

## Entry #18

#### CCQ

If Lift didn't get what she wanted from Nightwatcher (to stop aging) what did she get?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO but it has to do with why she can metabolize food into stormlight.

## Entry #19

#### CCQ

Did Ishar intentionally deceive Nalan or does Ishar have bad info that he passed on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and no. All of the heralds are insane.

#### CCQ

So I clarified the question to being did Ishar know that he was lying to Nalan

#### Brandon Sanderson

got a RAFO but he added something that seemed to mean that Ishar could perhaps see the future and that each insanity was unique and that uniqueness played a part in the info. Not really sure on the last part.

## Entry #20

#### yulerule

In the cosmere, you have matter, mind, and soul. Obviously, the physical world is most well understood (same as ours) and the spiritual is most mysterious. When anybody dies (going off from info in secret history) their soul, which was tied to their body, the connection is broken and the soul/cognitive shadow appears in the cognitive realm then goes on to the spiritual. If healing is applied at any moment while the soul/cognitive shadow is in the cognitive realm, the connection can be reestablished and that is why regrowth can heal recently dead. Type of wound shardblade vs not may determine how fast the shadow is sucked into the Spiritual Realm. Also amount of investiture a soul contains. Souls = investiture or at least all of them contain some?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So that's a RAFO. We'll dig into that a little later.

#### yulerule

Am I close?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, you're on the right track.

## Entry #21

#### Mason Wheeler

before, I had the general impression that there were maybe... \*waves hand\* a dozen or so Worldhoppers around, but this [the new book] totally blows that idea away. So, at the time that Khriss is writing the essays, approximately how many Worldhoppers were there in the Silverlight community?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Silverlight is a whole city.

#### Mason Wheeler

that could mean a wide range of sizes...

#### Brandon Sanderson

a lot bigger than a village. Not saying yet exactly how many people are there, [RAFO card,] but they're not all Worldhoppers. There are people who are born there, live out their whole lives and die there.

## Entry #22

#### Mason Wheeler

OK. Now, the Weeping that happens each year on Roshar, does that occur each time when the 3 moons are in a particular alignment?

#### Brandon Sanderson

no, it's more related to the planet's orbital position than the moons' position.

## Entry #23

#### wicktacular

If Hoid were a Magic card, what colors would he be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Five color. Although, if he were to drop a color, it would be White.

## Entry #24

#### wicktacular

Based on the bit during the open Q&A about Odium splintering Dominion and Devotion and shoving their power into the Cognitive, and that blocking off the Spiritual, which makes Sel's magic so location (or Identity of location) based - if a Shardbearer traveled to Sel, could they still summon their Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's interesting. Nobody's ever asked me that before. That's a RAFO! (I got a card!)

## Entry #25

#### wicktacular

At the end of Hero of Ages, it's significant that 1/16 of the soldiers who got sick were Atium mistings. We know now that there's more than 16 metals - what exactly happened there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, you have to remember, by that point, Preservation wasn't entirely there. He was mostly concerned with leaving hints, clues, with the number 16, towards his plan.

#### wicktacular

So, were the other remaining group of soldiers that fell sick all still mistings of the other base metals?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### wicktacular

So, did Preservation bump out one of the base metal types so those could be Atium mistings? And if so, which was it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that's right. It would probably have been one of the metals that was difficult to get at that level of technology. It would have been Chromium - Chromium would be hard gather at that time. Actually, no, it would have been Aluminum.
(about a minute later, while signing someone else's book) - Hold on, there's a caveat to that last answer. Let me finish signing this and expand on that.
So, it would still have been Aluminum, but not for the reason your thinking. It would have been Aluminum, but there's an asterisk next to that answer.

## Entry #26

#### AndrewHB

Is Niccolo Machiavelli's political theory, the ends justify the means, incompatible with the Knights Radiants' First Oath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Although many of the Orders of KRs would find Machiavelli's theory that the ends justify the means incompatible with additional Oaths and/or values of that Order, there are some Orders who could accept a Machiavellian. Brandon said that the Skybreakers where a Machiavellian could find a home.

#### Question

As Brandon was signing my books, I asked if the Elsecallers would also accept a Machiavellian.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## Entry #27

#### AndrewHB

Is the rapier a weapon that people who do not have a Shardblade use on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon asked why I asked this question. I answered that at the end of WoR, Jasnah created a Shardblade rapier. It was a weapon I do not recall any other person using in WoK or WoR. Brandon then said he would not answer. I asked if that would deserve a RAFO. He smiled and gave me a RAFO.

## Entry #28

#### AndrewHB

I asked if in the future, he would have Lift use a Trident as her main Shard weapon.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. The reader should not be surprised if Lift uses a trident as a Shard weapon (a ShardTrident).

## Entry #29

#### PatrickDiomedes

I asked whether Aluminum blocking investiture is simply an on/off situation, or whether different amounts/different alloys would inhibit it in different degrees

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was theoretically possible.

## Entry #30

#### yulerule

How much compounding would a nicrosil twinborn would need to do to get a metalmind that is as Invested as Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow so much.

#### Question

A thousand breaths doesn't seem to be that much - the God King has tens of thousands - would a piece of stone or wood or cloth or plain metal that has a thousand breaths be as Invested as Nightblood, or is there something more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

needs more

## Entry #31

#### yulerule

If an allomancer worldhopper really wanted to hack the magic system and knew what they were doing, could they get their hands on some Tanavast-ium or Rayse-ium or Egdli-um? Basically make god metals from the other shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## Entry #32

#### yulerule

Is Iyatil wondering around the cosmere (Roshar) with a heating medallion? She's a southern Scadrial, so she needs one of those so she won't freeze to death in normal temperatures.

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #33

#### yulerule

So somewhere it says that the number of Breaths doesn't determine the power of the object. But are the number of Breaths directly tied to how much Investiture is in an object? You're repeatedly said that Nightblood is ridiculously heavily invested, more so than Shardblades, Honorblades, or the Bands of Mourning. But it only has a thousand Breaths, which doesn't seem all that much from the point of view of the GodKing - Tenth Heightening, over 50,000.

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #34

#### yulerule

Do you actually need to physically inhale or can you like cognitively inhale. Can you think about inhaling without actually inhaling.

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is possible.

#### Question

Think about breathing

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would be fine

## Entry #35

#### Patrick Diomedes

If the technology for 3D printing, CNC milling and the like existed on Sel, would a Forger be able to use it to create stamps, or would they have to do it by hand.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They would be able to, but since they have to still create the stamps themselves, they'd have to be the ones to model/draw the stamps. (I take that to mean that a forger couldn't just download someone else's stamp and print it out and use it)

## Entry #36

#### PatrickDiomedes

Does TenSoon look like an Irish Wolfhound (which is how I've seen a lot of people draw him) or more like an actual wolf?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He looks more like a large wolf-like dog, such as a husky or something (though more wolflike than a husky, he was just using that as an example)

## Entry #37

#### PatrickDiomedes

Will we ever get some sort of dictionary/guide to Aons or Forging, one that tells us how they're made, with what all the various parts of a seal mean and how we could theoretically design them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We might, but it would be a ton of work for him to put together. He compared it to when people ask if we'll ever get the full text of the Way of Kings (the in-universe book) and he said that we might, but all he has is an outline.

## Entry #38

#### PatrickDiomedes

When a spren changes into a weapon, are they locked into one specific design for that type of weapon? Like, if Syl chose to be a longsword, could she only become that specific longsword?

#### Brandon Sanderson

no, they can become whatever they want/need.

## Entry #39

#### Patrick Diomedes

Who has the best and worst handwriting in the cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid's is just terrible, but it can also be really beautiful when he wants to, but Brandon said he didn't have a real answer for this one.

## Entry #40

#### PatrickDiomedes

Can you tell me anything new about the force or whatever that opposed Adonalsium (this was what I had him answer in my personalization)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would count groups of people as a force. (verbatim)

## Entry #41

#### PatrickDiomedes

I just remembered that someone asked about the whole movie deal thing, and Brandon gave a more thorough explanation.

#### Brandon Sanderson

What happened is that DMG, which is a chinese company, came to him first about the Emperor's Soul, because they wanted to make stuff that has more asian characters and they wanted to do it in hollywood because Hollywood's seriously lacking in representation of asians. So he sold that to them first, and then they called him back a couple months later asking about the entire cosmere. At that time, Mistborn was still optioned by another group, but brandon sold all the other stuff, and they started on Way of Kings right away, and then as soon as Mistborn became available they bought that up so that they had the entire cosmere. And he said that Way of Kings is ahead right now, but Mistborn will likely be first, because it'll be easier to produce and stuff.

## Entry #42

#### yulerule

question not specified

#### BrandonSanderson

I also got confirmed that the metal that spren turn into is god metal (we probably already knew that).

## Entry #43

#### yulerule

I also asked about the connection between the spren and surgebinder, such that the spren turns into what the surgebinder wants, like In Edgedancer, Lift turns into a bar of metal and into a Shardfork. Wyndle himself isn't "in tune" with Lift, so his turning into something that she needs with no prior warning ...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Since the spren fill in the soul, they're connected on that level, so like their minds are separated, but since the souls are melded/connected/same that the spren can turn into stuff the Surgebinder wants. This is heavily paraphrased.

## Entry #44

#### PageRunner

\*holding out list of Allomantic metal symbols\* Is ettmetal's symbol one of these 4? \*Points at the unused ones\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It has a symbol, but I don't think you've seen it yet. No, you haven't seen it.

#### PageRunner

\*making connections internally\* Oh, that's interesting, since we have seen Harmonium's symbol.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, you haven't. Have you?

#### PageRunner

Yeah, we have.
\*momentary staredown\*
It looks like the double lerasium. \*waves hands around in the air like an idiot to pantomime the axis of reflection\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*looks crestfallen\* Oh. Right. Then, I guess you have seen ettmetal's symbol.

#### PageRunner

\*cackles internally\* So, ettmetal is Harmonium!

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*sadly\* Yes...

#### PageRunner

Am I allowed to tell people? I can keep it a secret if you want.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, you can tell people.

#### PageRunner

\*almost ditches the rest of his signing turn to go tell people\*

## Entry #45

#### PageRunner

Are the Cognitive Shadows on Braize the mythical Shades of the Knights Radiant?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO Card
