# [Interview #496: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Some Long-Awaited Updates, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=496#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The other thing that happened in December to slow me is that production from Tor started to get anxious because they didn't have
*The Way of Kings*
(book one of my new series,
*The Stormlight Archive*
) in final form yet. So I had to spend a lot of time working on another draft of that book, along with getting some of the interior artwork done.

Talk has already started to float around the internet about
*Kings*
. I'll start posting more about the book in the upcoming months. I wanted this update to be focused on the Wheel of Time.
