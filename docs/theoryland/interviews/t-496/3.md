# [Interview #496: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Some Long-Awaited Updates, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=496#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I put that progress bar up so that you can keep track of me, and because I feel that readers deserve to see how things are going on my books. It's just how I like to do things. But don't let it become too much of a crutch to you, an absolute indication that things are moving or not moving. I'm always working, and these last two months have been no exception. (Arrival of my second son notwithstandingâ€”I sent out
[a newsletter about that](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/60/Brandon-Sanderson-Newsletter-for-February-2010)
, and if you didn't get it, you might want to
[drop me an email through the form on my website](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/contact/)
and ask to sign up. Be sure to let me know what city/state/country you live in so that I can let you know when I'll be stopping by on tour.) If you didn't get it, here are the details on Meatloaf's arrival:

> A baby boy has come to the Sanderson family. Dallin Matthew was born on January 19th, weighing in at 9 lbs. 2 oz. He joins his two-year-old brother Joel as heir to Brandon's literary legacy. (Though Joel has only recently started speaking much English. He used to talk and talk and talk, but apparently in an alien language with inflections that sounded maddeningly familiar. Anyway, Joel's favorite word in English is "cars.")
>
> Emily, Brandon's wife and business manager for Dragonsteel Entertainment (her official company title is "Queen"), is adjusting to being the mother of two boys. Joel is helping her out by learning not to throw things; I haven't seen him throw anything off the second-floor balcony in weeks!
