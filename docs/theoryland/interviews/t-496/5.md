# [Interview #496, Entry #5]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Some Long-Awaited Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=496#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Remember, I do often make little notes on my
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
pages (the two are mirrored) about what I'm doing and how it's going. So if you're salivating for info, you can keep an eye on one of the two. There's not a
*ton*
of information there, but there is some.
