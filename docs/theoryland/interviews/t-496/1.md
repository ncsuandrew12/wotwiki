# [Interview #496: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Some Long-Awaited Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=496#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Time to sit down and talk about some things. I hope this doesn't get too rambly for you, but I've been getting a lot of questions about
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*The Way of Kings*
, so I thought I'd give you some updates regarding what's been happening over here at Dragonsteel Entertainment HQ. (Also known as my basement.)
