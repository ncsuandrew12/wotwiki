# [Interview #556: TOM Signing Report - Sacramento Tower Guards, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=556#5)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

After dinner Brandon and Harriet both got up on a ladder to see out over the bookshelves and addressed the crowd. They thanked everyone for coming of course, and Harriet made sure to let people know how much it meant to her to see us all out there supporting her husband's work. They announced the rules for the signing, i.e. what Brandon and Harriet would and wouldn't sign. And Harriet told us about the great vest she was wearing that was made from her husband's old ties. RJ had great taste in neckware.
