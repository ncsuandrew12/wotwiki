# [Interview #556: TOM Signing Report - Sacramento Tower Guards, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=556#9)

#### Tower Guards

We took some final pictures and said our goodbyes. It was a long night, but it was a great experience. It was easily one of the most fun I've had stuck for eight hours in a bookstore. A good time was hopefully had by all, and hopefully Sacramento gets another visit next year.

Thank you to everyone who came out.

Yours Truly,

Sacramento Tower Guards
