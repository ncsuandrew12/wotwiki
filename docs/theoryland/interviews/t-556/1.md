# [Interview #556: TOM Signing Report - Sacramento Tower Guards, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=556#1)

#### Tower Guards

Hello my fellow WoT maniacs!

Sorry this is so late, a full three days after the event. Hopefully I can make it up to you with punch and pie. Well no, I don't have any of that. I do have this reports and some pictures though. Almost as good, right?

All pictures for the event can be found at:

And for those that haven't finished the book yet, don't worry. This is a No Spoiler Zone.
