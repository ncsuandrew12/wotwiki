# [Interview #569: TOM Signing Report - kamarile, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=569#1)

#### Kamarile

Posted this in the errata/continuity thread for

, but I asked Brandon about Carlinya's death, specifically whether that was a mistake. I had assumed that it was, because Min's viewing regarding her hasn't, to my knowledge, come to pass. (That viewing being the one of ravens, drawings of them, settling on her shoulders.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

According to him, that was NOT a mistake, and that that viewing doesn't necessarily mean what most people take it to mean. He said he would explain laterâ€”not sure if he meant that to be in a later interview, or if it was a RAFO situation. Definitely food for thought.

#### Footnote

Kamarile seems to have confused this viewing with a Dream that Egwene had about Mat; they are quite similar, but Min only saw a raven for Carlinya which she believed was a tattoo. Maria answered the question about Carlinya
