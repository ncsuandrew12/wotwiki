# [Interview #566: TOM Signing Report - Robert Mee, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=566#10)

#### Robert Mee

Someone else (two different people, actually) asked about Nakomi.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon RAFO'd, but then said that there were some very interesting theories out there, and that some hard core fan freaks may have had some that were more accurate than others he'd seen. I don't know if he's referring to Theoryland specifically or just the OCD fan community in general.
