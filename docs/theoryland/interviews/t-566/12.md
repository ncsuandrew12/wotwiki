# [Interview #566: TOM Signing Report - Robert Mee, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=566#12)

#### Robert Mee

Just a tag on. Someone asked about Rand's new/old sword... the one he's carrying now.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said it had definitely been seen before, and not in a tapestry. Brandon also DEFINITIVELY stated that we saw it in
*The Great Hunt*
. I have a very good feeling that the sword being Justice (which we saw in Artur Hawkwing's hands at Falme) is the right "looney theory" for this one.

#### Footnote

It was confirmed by Brandon
[in an email](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/51901-tgs-signing-tour-qa-plot-related/)
that the sword is Justice.
