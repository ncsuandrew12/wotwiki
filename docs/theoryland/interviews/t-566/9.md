# [Interview #566: TOM Signing Report - Robert Mee, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=566#9)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Taim may not be a standard Third Ager. Brandon wouldn't say any further because he has about five chapters revolving around the Black Tower to write for the beginning of the next book and he didn't want to spoil, so it was half a RAFO.

#### MATT HATCH

Specific questions?

#### ROBERT MEE

I just asked if Taim was a "standard" Third Ager. He pondered it for a minute or so before explaining that he had a few more chapters to write about what was happening at the Black Tower, so he didn't want to give too much away.
