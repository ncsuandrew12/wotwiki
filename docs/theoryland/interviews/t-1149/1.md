Are any of the Lord Ruler's descendants kandra?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### little wilson

Have we seen any them in Era 2?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### little wilson

Where?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a lot of descendants, percentage-wise, but you're looking for something that isn't there. There are descendants of the Lord Ruler, but there's not some secret coven. It's not outside of reason to say that some of his descendants are part of a coven, but it's not like some super-secret magic society.
