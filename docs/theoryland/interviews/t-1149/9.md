#### zas678

Did Vasher visit Roshar before or after the Recreance? I ask because he probably had to have seen a live Shardblade to model Nightblood after, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher didn't have to have seen a live Shardblade. He could've heard stories and modeled Nightblood after those.
