# [Interview #228: KOD Signing Report - Scott Carlson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=228#4)

#### Robert Jordan

Since I snagged a seat fairly close to the desk he was signing at, I got to listen in on the snippets that seemed story-related rather than personal or involving his writing process, and gleaned in addition that there's a 50/50 chance that the next book will be based off the working title
*A Memory of Light*
, and that book twelve (which he declared in his opening spiel will absolutely positively be the last book if it ends up 3000 pages long and they have to sell it with a bookstand and luggage carrierâ€”not an exact quote but close) will definitely "cover Tarmon Gai'don and a little beyond."
