#### Scott Carlson

The first was: "Lately Lews Therin has been in Rand's head increasingly, and increasingly, Lews Therin has been bemoaning that he's got voices in his head. Is Lews Therin merely a disembodied voice in Rand's head in Rand's time, or is there some kind of time-spanning link between them, and Rand is concurrently a disembodied voice in Lews Therin's head in the Age of Legends?"

#### Robert Jordan

RJ replied that it is the former; that Lews Therin is a disembodied voice that refuses to believe he is a disembodied voice.
