# [Interview #228: KOD Signing Report - Scott Carlson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=228#3)

#### Scott Carlson

On my second trip up, I went for what I figured was the longer-shot. I asked "Rand has been having the dizzy spells and sick sensations when channeling, despite having cleansed
*saidin*
. Is this an lasting effect of the taint, like having built up some taint in male channelers that won't go away?"

#### Robert Jordan

And the answer was "No, it's completely unrelated to the taint."

#### Scott Carlson

In retrospect, I should have gone for an either/or on the second question, posing Lews Therin trying to seize control of
*saidin*
as a second option, and maybe gotten a positive confirmation on my top two contenders, instead of just a negative confirmation on one.
