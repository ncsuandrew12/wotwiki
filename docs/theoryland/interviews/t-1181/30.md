How much compounding would a nicrosil twinborn would need to do to get a metalmind that is as Invested as Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow so much.

#### Question

A thousand breaths doesn't seem to be that much - the God King has tens of thousands - would a piece of stone or wood or cloth or plain metal that has a thousand breaths be as Invested as Nightblood, or is there something more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

needs more
