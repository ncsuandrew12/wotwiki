# [Interview #1181: Little City Books-AU Tour, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1181#19)

#### CCQ

Did Ishar intentionally deceive Nalan or does Ishar have bad info that he passed on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and no. All of the heralds are insane.

#### CCQ

So I clarified the question to being did Ishar know that he was lying to Nalan

#### Brandon Sanderson

got a RAFO but he added something that seemed to mean that Ishar could perhaps see the future and that each insanity was unique and that uniqueness played a part in the info. Not really sure on the last part.
