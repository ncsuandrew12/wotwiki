#### Patrick Diomedes

If the technology for 3D printing, CNC milling and the like existed on Sel, would a Forger be able to use it to create stamps, or would they have to do it by hand.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They would be able to, but since they have to still create the stamps themselves, they'd have to be the ones to model/draw the stamps. (I take that to mean that a forger couldn't just download someone else's stamp and print it out and use it)
