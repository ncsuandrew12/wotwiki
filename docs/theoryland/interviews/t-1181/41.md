I just remembered that someone asked about the whole movie deal thing, and Brandon gave a more thorough explanation.

#### Brandon Sanderson

What happened is that DMG, which is a chinese company, came to him first about the Emperor's Soul, because they wanted to make stuff that has more asian characters and they wanted to do it in hollywood because Hollywood's seriously lacking in representation of asians. So he sold that to them first, and then they called him back a couple months later asking about the entire cosmere. At that time, Mistborn was still optioned by another group, but brandon sold all the other stuff, and they started on Way of Kings right away, and then as soon as Mistborn became available they bought that up so that they had the entire cosmere. And he said that Way of Kings is ahead right now, but Mistborn will likely be first, because it'll be easier to produce and stuff.
