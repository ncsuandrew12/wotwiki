I also asked about the connection between the spren and surgebinder, such that the spren turns into what the surgebinder wants, like In Edgedancer, Lift turns into a bar of metal and into a Shardfork. Wyndle himself isn't "in tune" with Lift, so his turning into something that she needs with no prior warning ...

Since the spren fill in the soul, they're connected on that level, so like their minds are separated, but since the souls are melded/connected/same that the spren can turn into stuff the Surgebinder wants. This is heavily paraphrased.
