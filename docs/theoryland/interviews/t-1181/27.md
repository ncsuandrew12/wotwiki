#### AndrewHB

Is the rapier a weapon that people who do not have a Shardblade use on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon asked why I asked this question. I answered that at the end of WoR, Jasnah created a Shardblade rapier. It was a weapon I do not recall any other person using in WoK or WoR. Brandon then said he would not answer. I asked if that would deserve a RAFO. He smiled and gave me a RAFO.
