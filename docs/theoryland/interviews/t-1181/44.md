\*holding out list of Allomantic metal symbols\* Is ettmetal's symbol one of these 4? \*Points at the unused ones\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It has a symbol, but I don't think you've seen it yet. No, you haven't seen it.

#### PageRunner

\*making connections internally\* Oh, that's interesting, since we have seen Harmonium's symbol.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, you haven't. Have you?

#### PageRunner

Yeah, we have.
\*momentary staredown\*
It looks like the double lerasium. \*waves hands around in the air like an idiot to pantomime the axis of reflection\*

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*looks crestfallen\* Oh. Right. Then, I guess you have seen ettmetal's symbol.

#### PageRunner

\*cackles internally\* So, ettmetal is Harmonium!

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*sadly\* Yes...

#### PageRunner

Am I allowed to tell people? I can keep it a secret if you want.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, you can tell people.

#### PageRunner

\*almost ditches the rest of his signing turn to go tell people\*
