# [Interview #1181: Little City Books-AU Tour, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1181#21)

#### Mason Wheeler

before, I had the general impression that there were maybe... \*waves hand\* a dozen or so Worldhoppers around, but this [the new book] totally blows that idea away. So, at the time that Khriss is writing the essays, approximately how many Worldhoppers were there in the Silverlight community?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Silverlight is a whole city.

#### Mason Wheeler

that could mean a wide range of sizes...

#### Brandon Sanderson

a lot bigger than a village. Not saying yet exactly how many people are there, [RAFO card,] but they're not all Worldhoppers. There are people who are born there, live out their whole lives and die there.
