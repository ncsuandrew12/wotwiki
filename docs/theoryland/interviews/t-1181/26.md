#### AndrewHB

Is Niccolo Machiavelli's political theory, the ends justify the means, incompatible with the Knights Radiants' First Oath?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Although many of the Orders of KRs would find Machiavelli's theory that the ends justify the means incompatible with additional Oaths and/or values of that Order, there are some Orders who could accept a Machiavellian. Brandon said that the Skybreakers where a Machiavellian could find a home.

#### Question

As Brandon was signing my books, I asked if the Elsecallers would also accept a Machiavellian.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
