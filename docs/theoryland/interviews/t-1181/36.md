#### PatrickDiomedes

Does TenSoon look like an Irish Wolfhound (which is how I've seen a lot of people draw him) or more like an actual wolf?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He looks more like a large wolf-like dog, such as a husky or something (though more wolflike than a husky, he was just using that as an example)
