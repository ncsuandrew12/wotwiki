Experience and Character Behavior

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think it's possible to filter out who you are or where you came from or what you've experienced from what you write. If you can manage to filter yourself out of your writing entirely, then what you write is sterile. In the Wheel of Time, I've tried to give you not only characters who are people that you think you could meet, but people who behave the way those people would behave. And I put them in a world that is as different from this world as I can make it. And I try to make that world come alive in your head cinematically. I want you to see a different place, and to see it completely when you're reading what I write.
