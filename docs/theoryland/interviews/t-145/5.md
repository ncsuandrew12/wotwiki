My Childhood Influences

#### Robert Jordan

Three books:
*Tom Sawyer*
,
*Huckleberry Finn*
,
*From the Earth to the Moon*
. I was five years old; I started reading early. I set those books up on a table on end, and I sat in a chair with my feet in the chair, and my chin on my kneesâ€”I was a little skinnier then. And I stared at those books and I said, "I'm going to do this one day. I'm gonna make stories like this one day." I can make a living writing books. This is wonderful, this is great. Yes, I love to write. It's sort of like finding out you can make a living eating chocolate.
