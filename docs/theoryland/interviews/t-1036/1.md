# [Interview #1036: Pocatello Signing Report - LairdDuncan, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1036#1)

#### Question

You mention the phases of the moon fairly often in
*The Way of Kings*
â€”is this significant or something that we should be paying attention to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

After working with the Wheel of Time community and dealing a lot with fans wanting to know when certain events happened in regards to some other event, Brandon added in the phases of the moon in order to give dedicated fans a way of determining the chronology of the events of the Stormlight Archives.

#### Footnote

"Phase" is not the word Brandon used, it has more to do with which moon is up.
