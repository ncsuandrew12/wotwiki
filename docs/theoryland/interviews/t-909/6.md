# [Interview #909, Entry #6]: Q&A With Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=909#6)

#### Details

Is there a revenge-of-the-nerds quality to being a best-selling author?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I was a nerdy kid going through high school, and then I got to college and that all vanished. I mean, a lot of my good friendsâ€”when we were in high school, we would never have been able to hang out together because we were in such different cliques or whatever. Now, who cares? I'll make them watch the latest Star Trek movie and they'll make me watch, you know, the World Series, and we'll get along and enjoy each other's world and culture. So no, I really don't feel that.
