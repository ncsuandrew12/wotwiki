# [Interview #909: Q&A With Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=909#1)

#### Ruth Baron

If the epic-fantasy genre seems suited only to people who play Magic: The Gathering and own Star Wars bedding, consider this: Robert Jordan's unfinished Wheel of Time series has sold more than 44 million copies. That's a lot of readers who were left on the edge of their seats when the author died in 2007â€”including Brandon Sanderson, the 33-year-old writer who was chosen by Jordan's widow to complete the series using the notes her husband left behind. Today, Sanderson is releasing the first of the three concluding volumes,
*The Gathering Storm*
(Tor, $30), and is facing expectations from fans who make a tween girl's passion for the Jonas brothers look like what it is: child's play.
