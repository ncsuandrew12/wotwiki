#### Details

Are you nervous about
*The Gathering Storm*
's reception?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was a lot more nervous before I got it done. The fan community realizes that Robert Jordan wanted this book written, and they want to know the ending. There are going to be people who don't like itâ€”I think that's inevitable. I can't write this book as well as Robert Jordan would have. That said, I think I've done a dang good job.
