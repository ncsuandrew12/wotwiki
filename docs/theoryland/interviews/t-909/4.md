# [Interview #909: Q&A With Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=909#4)

#### Details

Do you dress up for industry conventions such as Dragon\*Con?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have never dressed up. Though I do like to say those are my people. There's this thing called the geek hierarchy—you can Google it. Furries, who dress up like animals, are down at the bottom. Then you've got the people in the costumes, and at the top, the science-fiction/fantasy writers. But the big joke is that we're all equally nerdy, just in different ways.

#### Details

And you participated in the first JordanCon this year. What was that like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Imagine it as a big party thrown by his [Jordan's] friends and fans in his honor to talk about his impact on the world through his literature. Some books cause a big change in people's lives and some don't. Star Wars—people go crazy over Star Wars. And people do the same thing for the Wheel of Time.
