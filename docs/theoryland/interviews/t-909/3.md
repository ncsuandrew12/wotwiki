# [Interview #909: Q&A With Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=909#3)

#### Details

Between churning out eight books of your own and completing the series, have you had the chance to read other fantasy authors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Fantasy has had some problems with being too repetitive, in my opinion. I try to read what other people are doingâ€”and say, How can I add to this rather than just recycle it? How can I stand on Tolkien's shoulders rather than stand tied to his kneecaps?
