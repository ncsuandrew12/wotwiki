#### Brandon Sanderson

Tor.com is continuing its reread of
*The Way of Kings*
. This week's article covers
[chapters 1 and 2](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/04/the-way-of-kings-reread-chapter-1-and-chapter-2)
, which include Kaladin's introduction.

And here's the
[newest video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlnFqu2rfdQ&hd=1)
of me writing a chapter from
*Words of Radiance*
. This is the climax, but there are two short videos after this. I'll upload the sped-up version of the chapter the same day I upload the final video.
