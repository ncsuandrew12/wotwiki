## Entry #1

#### Question

I went to the signing tonight and asked the "Where did Mat's spear come from and what was its significance for him receiving it from the Finns? He received i) a way out ii) to be free from Aes Sedai, and iii) to have his memories filled" question. It's one I've been wondering for a while.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ's answer was that the Finns just saw it as a way to kill Mat.
