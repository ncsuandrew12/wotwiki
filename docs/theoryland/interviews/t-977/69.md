# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#69)

#### ReaderAt2046

1. Do Stephen's aspects exist in the way bonded spren exist (independent Spiritual and Cognitive aspect but tied to a human.)?

2. Did Razon's camera use the same spiritual gravitational anchors as time bubbles?

#### Brandon Sanderson
