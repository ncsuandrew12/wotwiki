# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #180](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#180)

#### JamesW

You said that Preservation created the Terris Prophecies. Why couldn't ruin see into the future and counter Preservation's plan? Is it because Ruin's intent has him focusing more on the present than the future, while Preservation (wanting to preserve forever) looks more into the future for that goal.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Looking into the future was not something Ruin was good at doing. That ability is confined to certain shards, and not others.
