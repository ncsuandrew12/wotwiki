# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#12)

#### Kchan

In your books, we see a lot of really interesting and diverse world elements that make these places and cultures really come to life. What are some of the world elements you've had the most fun creating, and what do you like best about them?
Thanks again, and I hope you enjoy it here! We're crazy, but we like it that way.

I'd say that the spren on Roshar have been my favorite so far--they are so different, but also so RIGHT. They have a mythological fae-feel to them, but also fit into the cosmere arcanum just perfectly. I also like writing them.
