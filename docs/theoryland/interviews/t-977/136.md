# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #136](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#136)

Can we expect to see a fight between a Windrunner, an Awakener, and an Allomancer in one of the Stormlight books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've said before that it's unlikely that the Stormlight books will ever delve strongly into the connections between worlds. There will be some cool things happening for the cosmere-literate, but this series isn't focused on those concepts. I want it to maintain its plot cohesion for those who aren't aware of all of the behind-the-scenes stories.
Epilogue to Book Two should excite you, though.
