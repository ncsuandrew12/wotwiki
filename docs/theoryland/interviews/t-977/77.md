# [Interview #977, Entry #77]: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#77)

#### ReaderAt2046

Is it at all possible for Kelsier to be reincarnated/posess someone/show up as a ghost/whatever and become a character in a future Mistborn book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's shown up before, so I'd say that's a pretty good indication for the future.
