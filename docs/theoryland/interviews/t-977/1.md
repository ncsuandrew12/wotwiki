#### Rubix

Hey everyone, we have some exciting news! Brandon Sanderson will be doing a Q&A this week, right here. It is an amazing honor and privilege to have him here, and we're all really excited about this.

Here's how things will go down. You'll come to this topic to post your questions, which will be open for questions on Tuesday from 12:00am MDT to 11:59pm (so all of Tuesday), and then Brandon will come in and answer them sometime on Wednesday.

Some requests:

\*Keep the length of your questions reasonable, and don't ask a ridiculous number, either

\*No Wheel of Time questions

\*Please read through the questions that have already been asked to see if your question has been asked before you post

Thanks!
