# [Interview #977, Entry #76]: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#76)

#### ReaderAt2046

Does chocolate exist in the Cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Not on Roshar, though.

#### Footnote

Brandon has stated that Scadrial is an Earth analogue, so if chocolate exists anywhere in the cosmere, it's probably there.
