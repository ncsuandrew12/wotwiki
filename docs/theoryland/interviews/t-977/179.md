#### JamesW

Are there non-human races on Roshar, or non-humanoid races that are sentient?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Parshendi are not human, but you probably already knew that. The two races of Aimians are not human either. There are many races of sentient spren. From there, it depends if you call something like Ryshadium sentient or not.
