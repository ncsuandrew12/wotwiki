# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #169](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#169)

#### ROSHtafARian

In the Mistborn trilogy, the base 16 Allomantic metals separate into different groups like the Enhancement metals, etc. Given that there are 16 Shards, do they also separate into different groupings as well? For instance, are Shards like Honor and Devotion part of one 'grouping', with Shards like Cultivation and Endowment part of another?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question.
