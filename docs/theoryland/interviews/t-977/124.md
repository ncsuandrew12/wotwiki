# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #124](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#124)

#### Yamato

Any advice for an aspiring fantasy writer? Besides the obligatory "Read a lot and write a a lot!!!" Characterization advice is especially appreciated.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I do have my lectures on this topic. Go to
writeaboutdragons.com
and listen to the characterization lecture. I think you'll find it helpful.

Do remember that your characters should have passions, goals, and flaws that are distinct from the plot of the story. They can sometimes align, but a character should have a life and passions outside of what happens TO them.
