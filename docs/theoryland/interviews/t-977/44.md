# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#44)

#### Kurkistan

Would it be fair to describe the three realms as the Spiritual realm providing motivation/general directives (gravity, desires, energy, etc.), the Cognitive realm interpreting and applying those directives, and the Physical realm as where these directives--as interpreted by the Cognitive realm--are actually implemented? All of this with interactions/change flowing back and forth between the realms as well (Physical phenomena affecting thought affecting the spirit, for example).

Ha! That's a very interesting way to look at it. The theory isn't all there, but it's thinking along the right lines.
