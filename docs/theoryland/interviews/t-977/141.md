# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #141](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#141)

#### Thought

It seems that certain colors and numbers appear frequently in specific cosmere books, like the number 5 in Warbreaker or red and blue in Elantris. Do these colors or numbers happen to refer to a specific shard, and if so, would they be consistent across the cosmere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Certain colors and numbers are important in reference to certain shards.
