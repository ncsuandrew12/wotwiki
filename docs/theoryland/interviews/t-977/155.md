# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #155](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#155)

#### PricklyBear

Is there a functional/structural difference between modern-day Shardplate and the stuff the Radiants wore? Did the Radiants have to use infused gems to keep their suits going or could they just 'breathe in' Stormlight and feed the suit off of their 'inhaled' reserves?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Something is different. You will find out what.
