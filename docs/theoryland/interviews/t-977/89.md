# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #89](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#89)

#### Lightflame

You've confirmed that several Heralds have appeared or been mentioned in the modern (non-prelude, non-vision) parts of The Way of Kings. Have any members of the Knights Radiant (the one from the days of Urithiru, not near-Radiants like Kaladin) appeared in the modern parts of The Way of Kings? And if you have to RAFO me, could you give me a hint about the Heralds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can answer that--no, no Radiants from those days have appeared on screen in TWoK.
