# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #95](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#95)

#### McCullough

In what ways do you feel that finishing the Wheel of Time helped to prepare you for The Stormlight Archive and how did it change your writing in general, if at all?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I gained three things, I feel, by working over the years on the WoT. (And, in particular, by studying RJ's work in depth.) I learned how to better balance lots of different viewpoints, I got a better grip for foreshadowing and subtlety over many books, and I gained a deeper understanding of how to write a really sold third person viewpoint.
