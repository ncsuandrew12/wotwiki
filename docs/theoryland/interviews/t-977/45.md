Hey Brandon, thanks for doing this. My question is only tangentially related to your books. See, I've already read all of them. What book (or series of books) would you recommend while I wait for the next one?

Current "Brandon Suggests" list:

\*Anything by Guy Gavrial Kay (Tigana in specific.) Slight content warning.

\*Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly

\*A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge

\*Anything by Robin Hobb, but particularly the Fitz books.

\*Brent Weeks (Black Prism in particular.)

\*Going Postal is my favorite Pratchett right now. (If you read him, don't start with the first book. Start here or with Guards Guards.)

\*Anything by Daniel Abraham under any of his various pen names.

\*Anne McCaffrey if by some miracle you haven't read her yet.

\*The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms by N.K. Jemisin (Slight content warning.)

\*And, of course, Pat Rothfuss--who is a genius.
