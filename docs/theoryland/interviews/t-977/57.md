#### Shivertongue

do you ever try to match the music with the setting of a specific book or scene? Is there any one artist or style of music that works no matter what?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, indeed I do. I actually listened to era-appropriate music when working on Alloy of Law. In general, a good stoundtrack can work no matter what, but for some scenes I need something more powerful. (Szeth's scenes in TWoK were usually to Daft Punk.)
