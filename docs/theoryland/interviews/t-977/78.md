#### ReaderAt2046

Can a Feruchemist store an attribute in a metalmind that someone else has already stored in and if so, do the charges affect each other in any way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but the charges are just stored in separate pieces of the metal, and don't really influence one another.
