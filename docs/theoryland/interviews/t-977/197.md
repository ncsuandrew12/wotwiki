# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #197](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#197)

#### Master\_Moridin

Why aren't Seons affected by the lack of a chasm line in their Aon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If they tried to actualize their Aon, it would have an undesirable result. In addition, the chasm broke their bond to the humans they were tied to, and you can see the result of that. So they were affected.
