# [Interview #977, Entry #194]: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#194)

#### XFER

And I saw on facebook about the discussion about the name of the second book. This is more like a request, please, keep the name of it being The Book Of Endless Pages. That title is awesome! Oh and another suggestion, please, keep making huge books! Now, after reading your books, I expect books to be at least 600 pages, so you can see I get disappointed quite often lol

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will keep the books, in this series at least, long. It's what the story demands. As for title...it does have a certain charm, but I worry that it just feels wrong to too many people. Three out of four laugh when I mention it. That doesn't bode well...

#### Footnote

Brandon has since renamed the second book of the Stormlight Archive to, "Words of Radiance."
