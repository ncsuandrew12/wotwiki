# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #73](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#73)

What would happen if, right after someone died, they were made into a Lifeless, and then Endowment tried to Return that person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oooh...now that's a spicy one. Endowment's gift of a superpowered Breath would come down, strike the Lifeless, and all kinds of craziness would occur. You'd end up with a drab god, which would be hilarious.
