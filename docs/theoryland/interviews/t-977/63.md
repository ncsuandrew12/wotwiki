# [Interview #977, Entry #63]: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#63)

#### FireArcadia

Does the world map in the Way of Kings show all of the landmasses of Roshar? Does that make the continent on Roshar a Pangaea-like supercontinent? And as I think about it, are there tectonic plates on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a supercontinent. I won't say there is NOTHING out there, but (unlike Scadrial) there is not another full continent. Plate tectonics are not a factor on the supercontinent.
