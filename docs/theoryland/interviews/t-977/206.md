# [Interview #977, Entry #206]: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#206)

#### Arcanist

7. When will be see the whole Cosmere-concept (Shards, the plans of Hoid) at the level of the books? In the third Mistborn trilogy or earlier? In which books do you plan to finish the “hidden story” which connects all your earlier books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Third Mistborn Trilogy will certainly include some of this. We shall see if I do any of Hoid's stories before then.
