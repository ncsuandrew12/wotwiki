# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #117](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#117)

#### Kuri Shardweaver

Unrelated to the Cosmere, simply from one guy who fancies himself a writer now and again to a wildly successful author I respect deeply; I run a forum RP here on the site called Seeking The Eternal Conflux, and it would pretty much make my year to hear your opinion on the concept and Races I've constructed thus far, and whether or not it's a foundation for a compelling story.

Looks pretty good to me. I like how you've got a major goal in finding the intersection of the laylines. I think that alone gives a good foundation for a story. With the races, I was worried at first because the first race looked like it might be just an "Orc with a new name" type race. However, they grew very diverse from there, and I found them interesting to read about. I'd say it looks good to me. Nice work.
