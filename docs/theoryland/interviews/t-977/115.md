# [Interview #977: Cosmere Q&A - 17th Shard, Entry #115](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=977#115)

#### Kuri Shardweaver

I've heard tell of an upcoming book where the magic is based on forging. This excites me greatly, and I was wondering if you could give us just a smidge more information regarding it? Either the world, the magic itself, or how it impacts said world? Though something like the Shard behind it would be awesome too..

Sure, the story is The Emperor's Soul, and it actually takes place on Sel. (Same planet of Elantris.) The magic system works by using a carefully designed stamp to rewrite the past of an object--creating a 'forgery' of its past, and that changes what it is in the future. Rewrite the past of a beat-up chair so it was owned by someone who cared for it, and suddenly it's polished and maintained. It's not illusion; it's an actual transformation.

It works on the same mechanics of AonDor and its kin, using written characters to access the Dor and channel its power.
