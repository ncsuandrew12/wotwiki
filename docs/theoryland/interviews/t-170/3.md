# [Interview #170, Entry #3]: COT Signing Report - Brandon](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=170#3)

#### Brandon

Major thanks to CC Book and Music Co. They were way helpful and super nice, and if anyone talks to RJ thank him for signing my books. I can't remember if I told him so after getting them signed (still nervous at that point). It was a great experience with courteous people and even after reading about the jokes he tells before going to the signing I still laughed. His personality was so jovial and warm even my wife had a great time and she has never read any of his books.
