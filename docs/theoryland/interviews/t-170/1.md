# [Interview #170: COT Signing Report - Brandon, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=170#1)

#### Brandon

Straight to the point. All of the plot lines will NOT be wrapped up at the end of the series. I attended the book signing at Chester County Book and Music Company today and someone a few people ahead of me asked a question that I couldn't hear, but RJ's answer went something like this:

#### Robert Jordan

No. The one thing I don't like about most fantasy is that everything gets tied up in the end. The people, the cities, everything finishes and it dries up. The book gets put on the shelf and collects dust. I want the world to be vibrant and still going. Some minor plots will go on and things in the world will stay alive.

#### Brandon

This is in NO WAY a direct quote. I have never been to a book signing and was somewhat struck and nervous about meeting him, plus I had no writing or recording equipment. The overall vibe I got was that he really does care about the world he has created and won't leave out anything major.
