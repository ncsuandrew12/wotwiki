# [Interview #170: COT Signing Report - Brandon, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=170#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Also if anyone cares I asked him to describe the texture and feel of Bashere's baton of the Marshal-General. I was hoping he would say it "felt not like ivory, not like glass, but more like glass," as is the description of the known Oath Rods (note the only times we've seen it have been in Rand POVs and at first it was "what appeared to be an ivory rod", then later Rand assumes it is an ivory rod). However, I was greatly disappointed. He said, "it was smooth and heavy...ivory capped with gold." Oh well I guess Rand's later assumptions that it is just ivory are correct.
