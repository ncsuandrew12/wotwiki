# [Interview #451: Mythmaker Films Interview, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=451#18)

#### Interviewer

What was your first reaction when you actually saw the hardcover book with your name and Robert Jordan's together, and it was a reality?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, it was a reverent moment. I just sat there and kind of stared at it for a while. It was awesome, it really was. I mean, what else can you say? It was awesome. A lot of people have asked about the signature of Robert Jordan on the title page. That was there because I actually asked Harriet if they would place it, because I knew I would feel weird signing the book without Robert Jordan's signature there. And so, if people get confused about that, I apologize. I didn't realize how realistic they would make it, but I wanted his signature there so it wasn't about me, so it could be about both of us. And him first, and then a little bit of Brandon Sanderson.
