#### Marie Curie

This is a transcript of a video produced by
[Mythmaker Films](http://vimeo.com/9109667)
(and JR Burningham in particular) of a signing and interview conducted with Brandon in November 2009 during
*The Gathering Storm*
book tour. The interview is sort of interesting in that in weaves in little interludes of Brandon speaking, fan interviews, and signing questions from Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, CA, on November 17, 2009 with a sit-down interview conducted around the same time.
