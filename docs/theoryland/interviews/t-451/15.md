# [Interview #451: Mythmaker Films Interview, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=451#15)

#### Interviewer at Vroman's

Who's your favorite character?

#### Fan

Perrin. He's very very very self sacrificing to a fault. And I love the crap out of him for that one. So I'd have to say Perrin, for sure.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Perrin is, of all the main characters, the furthest back in his arc, if that makes sense. Like, through the most recent books, he was growing and he was getting there, he was almost there. And then, he let himself be diverted from achieving these things that he needed to achieve. And I won't say whether he achieves them or not. Sometimes the arc is. . . at the end of the arc, they make the wrong decisions.
