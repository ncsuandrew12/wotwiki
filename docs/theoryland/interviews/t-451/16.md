# [Interview #451: Mythmaker Films Interview, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=451#16)

#### Interviewer at Vroman's

Who's best at dealing with women? Rand, Perrin, or Mat?

#### Fan 1

Perrin.

#### Fan 2

I think Mat.

#### Fan 3

Mat.

#### Fan 4

Oh, I like Mat, yeah.

#### Interviewer

Is he best with dealing with them, or are we just kind of hot for him?

#### Fan 4

Is there a difference?

#### Fan 5

He's obviously a bit of a rogue and a bit of a womanizer.

#### Fan 6

There's been a debate about that. Mat respects women, and he only goes after the women who are open to be chased after.

#### Brandon Sanderson

(laughing) They're all terrible.
