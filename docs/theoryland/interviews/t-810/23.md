#### Nalini Haynes

I have been told that
*Way of Kings*
has been set in the same universe as Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is. All of my epic fantasies have been set in the same universe.

#### Nalini Haynes

Are they on different planets?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are different planets, but there is a character who is in every one of them. The same character is in
*Warbreaker*
and in Mistborn. There are other characters who appear here and there and cross between the books.

#### Nalini Haynes

Who is the character?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*Warbreaker*
he is the storyteller, Hoid, with the dust, and he’s the King’s Wit from
*Way of Kings*
. If you read Mistborn, he is named Hoid in each of those as well. In
*Alloy of Law*
and
*Well of Ascension*
, he is not named but is only there to be picked out by description, but in the others he’s named. I did this because, during those early days writing books, I wrote thirteen, as I said earlier.

I love the big epics. You can’t be a Wheel of Time fan without loving big epics. I wanted to tell a big epic, but early on it seemed to me that writing a whole bunch of books in the same series was a bad way to break in. If an editor rejects the first one, you can’t really send in the second one.

So, while hunting editors, I wrote thirteen books that were all different worlds, different settings. I started having characters sneakily move between them, to be building, setting the stage for a grand epic that I would tell later on, behind the scenes. So from the get go, from
*Elantris*
, this was all planned because this is something I been doing in my books since then.
