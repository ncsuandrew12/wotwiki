# [Interview #810: Dark Matter Interview, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=810#12)

#### Nalini Haynes

A reader asked what it was like reading the Wheel of Time drafts and not being able to discuss the story with your fellow fans.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I’m usually pretty open, as a writer. If you look at my blog I talk about what I’m working on, but I can’t do that with the Wheel of Time. That has been a little bit hard for me, to be more closed mouthed. It is a project that requires some closed-mouthedness; the fans are really dedicated. If you say one word, they’ll parse that word, figure out what you meant by it, and spend hours discussing it, so you’ve really got to be on your toes. Fortunately I’ve been able to discuss it with my wife who was included in the NDA (non-disclosure agreement) and with Robert Jordan’s two assistants. I do have people to talk to about it. It hasn’t been as hard as having to be on my toes, making sure I haven’t said the wrong thing lest I give a clue as to what is going to happen.
