Does the Masters of English help these days with revision now that you have got to the point where you are revising?

#### Brandon Sanderson

To be perfectly honest, I love my Masters degree—I’m glad I did it—but it’s like 2% help where practice is 98%. You don’t need schooling to become a writer; you need practice. Practice and good feedback. Granted, in the Masters degree I met a couple of people who gave me good feedback, but I met many outside who gave me good feedback as well. For those writers out there: really, practice, practice, practice.

You can learn as much from a good book about writing—like Stephen King’s
*On Writing*
or something—as you can learn in a college course. Most college courses are ‘write a book and workshop it.’ You can do that on your own. I did enjoy my Masters degree. It was fun to get help learning about the philosophy of writing, but you don’t need to know the philosophy of writing in order to write. You need to know the philosophy of writing to write about writing.
