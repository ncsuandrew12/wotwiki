# [Interview #810: Dark Matter Interview, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=810#2)

#### Nalini Haynes

On Friday 13 I met Brandon to talk to him about his career and his novels. We chatted in the foyer of the Stamford Grand, a hotel in central Melbourne. The foyer has a lounge where we sat in plush chairs at a little side table, surprisingly secluded for a lobby section of a busy international hotel. Brandon was wearing jeans, a tee with a check shirt hanging open over the top and—wait for it—a brown suede folding akubra, or the Australian equivalent of a cowboy hat.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You notice I’m wearing my Akubra, just special for you guys. I don’t know if it looks good or if it makes me look like a total tourist, but I decided I would wear it.

#### Nalini Haynes

I like it, personally. I think it looks good and they’re so practical.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s really practical. I mean, it folds up and stuff—it’s great. I like it.

#### Nalini Haynes

Be careful about folding it up: my husband used to have one of them and the wire gets bent and it gets really hard to get back into shape.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, okay. Don’t fold it too much is what you’re saying? Okay. I am kind of a hat person: I like hats. I brought my bowler with me to wear around but then I switched to the Akubra.

#### Nalini Haynes

Very nice.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I figure I need a local hat. I forced my wife to buy one too.

#### Nalini Haynes

So she's here too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

She was here in Perth and stayed for the first half of the tour, then she flew home. It gets a little bit wearying. I mean, I’m here for three weeks. She wanted to get home to the family. My mother was babysitting. Again, babysitting the kids for a week is great for Grandma, but after a week it does get a little—you know—so we didn’t want to wear out our welcome.

#### Nalini Haynes

Babysitting privileges are very important.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, they are, they are indeed.

#### Nalini Haynes

How many kids do you have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We have two, a little four-year-old boy and a little two-year-old boy.

#### Nalini Haynes

So they’re a handful.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are. They always say you get what is coming to you. I have a little brother who is two years younger than myself, and we were supposedly a handful at that age too. So now I get to know the joys. They’re wonderful, they’re delightful, but two little boys are just balls of energy. I wish you could find some way to plug in to them and harness that energy. You could probably power the whole city. They’re just always going somewhere, you turn around and they’ve climbed up four shelves trying to reach something you’ve put up there.

#### Nalini Haynes

Yes, oh yes. I remember when my son was that age. It was so scary. What are their names?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Joel and Dallin. Dallin is a local name; you don’t hear it much outside the area but it’s very common in the West there. A lot of people seem confused by it—Dallin, where’d you get that?—but it’s fairly common. I don’t know what the original derivation is, I should look it up, but it’s one of those names that we see that we liked.
