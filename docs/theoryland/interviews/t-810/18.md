# [Interview #810: Dark Matter Interview, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=810#18)

#### Nalini Haynes

I am currently reading
*Warbreaker*
and I am loving what Vivenna is going through, questioning herself and her motivations.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you, I appreciate that. That book, in my mind, the English professor version, is a book about reversals. Different people have to fulfill roles that they didn’t expect they would have to fulfill. Characters that you don’t expect doing things—the twists and turns are about reversing people’s roles in the plot. Hopefully that theme works for you as you finish the book.

#### Nalini Haynes

Yes, I’m very close. [Shows Brandon the bookmark in

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, wow, so you’ve hit most of them already.

#### Nalini Haynes

I was trying to get it finished before the interview, but I’m getting there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s all right. Yeah.
