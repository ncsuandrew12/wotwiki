#### Nalini Haynes

When are the sequels for
*Way of Kings*
and
*Alloy of Law*
coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am working on revisions for the last Wheel of Time novel, and I have a number of revisions to do; Iâ€™m planning to be done with that around July. At that point I will write the sequel to
*Way of Kings*
. I feel very bad that people have to wait so long for the second book, but I plan to be much quicker in the future. And I plan to alternate a
*Way of Kings*
book and a Mistborn book after that.
