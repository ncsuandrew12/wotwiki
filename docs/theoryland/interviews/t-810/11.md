#### Nalini Haynes

I heard a few years back that the new author was supposed to have actually met Robert Jordan while he was in hospital?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I did not. I saw him once at a convention, just as a fan and that’s it. I never met him for real. I didn’t know him. I was chosen because his wife was his editor; before he passed away he asked her to find somebody to finish his series. Since she was an editor, he felt she could handle this. She chose me based on my works. I didn’t know I was being considered; I didn’t apply for it. She read Mistborn and called me.

#### Nalini Haynes

Wow.

#### Brandon Sanderson

As an aside to that, I was known as a fan of his work, which is why she went to read mine. She was looking for somebody who had, vocally, said they liked the Wheel of Time who was also a writer.

#### Nalini Haynes

I read your eulogy on the website. It was very much ‘wow and I hope it gets finished’.
