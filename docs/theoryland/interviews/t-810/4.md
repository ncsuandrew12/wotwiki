# [Interview #810: Dark Matter Interview, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=810#4)

#### Nalini Haynes

You’re very philosophical in your writing. I’m currently reading
*Warbreaker*
: I’m finding a lot of philosophy is coming out there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I was a philosophy minor in college.

#### Nalini Haynes

Do you think that’s linked to
*Les Misérables*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think so. Certainly I love that book, I’ve read it a number of times. What I love about
*Les Misérables*
is that Victor Hugo had this brilliant way of characterizing both heroes and villains so that they felt very, very real to you. Then there is this true heroism in the everyday things they did. More than, I think, epic fantasy has. We need to learn this better. Some of the true heroism is in the little heroisms. We deal with saving the world, and I love doing that—I write epic fantasy. But some of the most heroic moments in fiction and in real life are not about saving the world, they’re about the little sacrifices that people make. I think that those are, in some ways, a more true and more real and more honest way of telling stories. So I try to let myself be influenced by stories that do a good job at that.

#### Nalini Haynes

Joss Whedon in
*Angel*
: Angel says something about nothing that we do has meaning, so the smallest thing that we do has the most incredible meaning because we’re not doing it for a reward. Is that kind of what you’re saying?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That sounds good to me. I’ve never actually watched
*Angel*
. I love
*Firefly*
but I came to Joss Whedon late: when
*Buffy*
was on I was a poor college student without access to a television and cable so I kind of missed that whole
*Buffy*
thing. It wasn’t until
*Firefly*
that I got into Joss’s work.

#### Nalini Haynes

That’s something we have in common. I got into
*Firefly*
and then from that–

#### Brandon Sanderson

You got into
*Buffy*
and
*Angel*
?

#### Nalini Haynes

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I keep meaning to. My friends are all
*Buffy*
addicts, they say ‘you’ve got to watch this, you’ve got to watch this!’ and I say: ‘Where’s the tiiime?’ There’s something like six seasons of that and six seasons of
*Angel*
. But someday.

#### Nalini Haynes

Seven seasons of
*Buffy*
, five of
*Angel*
.
