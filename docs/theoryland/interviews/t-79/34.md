#### LadyWolff

Is there an email address where we can write to you?

#### Robert Jordan

No. There is a way that you can get the latest information on the Wheel of Time series. By dialing: 1-800-221-7945. Then extension 701. This number is St. Martin's Press, and the extension has me telling you what the latest information is about when the next book will be out, what the price will be, that sort of thing.
