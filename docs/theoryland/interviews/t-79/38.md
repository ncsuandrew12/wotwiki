#### Ishamael

What made you decide on Robert Jordan as your pseudonym? Is it Hemingway?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it wasn't Hemingway. I simply wanted to separate the different kinds of books that I wrote with different names, and I made lists of names with my real initials and picked one name from one list and one from another, and Robert Jordan was one of the names that popped out.
