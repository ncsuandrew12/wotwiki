#### Gemmell

Are you considering writing any more short stories based on the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

I have agreed to do a short story in the universe of the Wheel of Time for an anthology put together by Bob Silverberg called "Masters of Fantasy," which I understand will include Stephen King, Anne Rice, Terry Pratchett, Ray Feist and some other people. That's it, really, as far as short fiction. I don't normally have the time to write short fiction.
