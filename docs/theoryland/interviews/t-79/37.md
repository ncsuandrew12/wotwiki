#### Hawkeye

Did you anticipate, and do you appreciate, such a cultish following?

#### Robert Jordan

I certainly never anticipated it. I'm not certain that it is a "cultish" following. I hope that it doesn't fall under that definition. As far as appreciating it, I'm very appreciative. I hope that's what you mean.
