# [Interview #79: DragonCon SciFi Channel Chat, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=79#24)

#### Eligar

So far all that is known about the final test before becoming Aes Sedai is that it involves channeling under extreme pressure. Would you be willing to give a little more detail? And if not, will we find out more later in the books or perhaps the Guide?

#### Robert Jordan

There will be more specific information about testing for Aes Sedai in the books themselves. For that reason, I really don't want to tell you anything here because it might spoil some surprises. At the very least, it might make you get to that point and say, "gee, I know this stuff! He's getting boring!"
