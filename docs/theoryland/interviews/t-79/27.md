Mr. Jordan, how do you feel when someone finds a minor or perhaps a major inconsistency in your books? (I'm not saying there are any. :P) Do you say, "oh well, better luck next time," or do you get really upset?

#### Robert Jordan

Sometimes people have found things that are typos, and sometimes people have found a place where a change or correction that I had intended to be put into the book was not before it was published. I always try to get those corrected as soon as possible after they're found. And, while I don't like having them there, I'm glad when someone points one out to me.

As for inconsistencies, I'm afraid inconsistencies are a failure to read the books correctly. Every time somebody has come to me with an inconsistency, I have been able to point out in a return letter where their mistake was.
