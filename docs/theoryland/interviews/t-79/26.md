#### Ravens

About the upcoming (and looking really great) Wheel of Time game by Legend Entertainment. How much control over the game do you have? (I'd hate seeing it ripped for the Wheel of Time feeling.) Do you think it would be possible to move the One Power into the game, working as it is to be understood in the books, and what is your overall opinion about making a game of the books before the books are finished? (I know it's a prequel, but anyways...)

#### Robert Jordan

I'm happy about making a game about the books before the books are finished. There have been some compromises between what I wanted in the games and what Legend wanted. At first, they told me that they couldn't do certain things until later and I said, "well, here's your money back." After which, they decided that maybe they could do those things now and, in fact, it seems that these things are part of what look to make this one of the hottest games—and maybe the hottest game—anywhere in sight.
