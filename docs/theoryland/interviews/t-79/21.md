#### Ishamael

You mentioned a museum-quality Wheel of Time weapons series a while back. Can you give us some more information on this?

#### Robert Jordan

I will be talking to Hank Reinhardt of Museum Replicas this weekend and he will be showing me the prototypes of the first weapons that are to be manufactured. I believe that they will be available for the first time in the fall of this year, but I'm not certain about that, it might be the spring of next year.
