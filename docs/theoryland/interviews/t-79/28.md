I've noticed a lot of the names in your books are based on historical cultures. Which culture do you think has influenced your books the most?

#### Robert Jordan

I think it's a toss-up between the ancient Celts, the Japanese of the Shogunites, and France of the 17th Century. But then, there are a lot of bits and pieces that have come from a great many sources. I'm not truthfully certain that the three that I gave you really ARE the greatest influences.
