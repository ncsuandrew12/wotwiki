# [Interview #79: DragonCon SciFi Channel Chat, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=79#1)

#### Don Harlow

This is edited from my log of this afternoon's chat session with Robert Jordan, who is currently at DragonCon. I have removed all comments during unmoderated periods when RJ was off-line due to technical difficulties, as well as his single-period comment terminators; I've combined multi-line replies into single paragraphs; I've reordered lines in two places where the moderator put in a new question before RJ was done replying to the previous one. Other than that, this is faithful to the discussion.

#### Robert Jordan

Hi guys.

#### Moderator

OK, let's begin. Robert, any opening statements?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Let the questions begin.
