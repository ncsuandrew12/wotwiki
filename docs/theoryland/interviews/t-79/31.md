#### Loial

What do you think has been your best book thus far? Do you like writing more action or more for the human emotions?

#### Robert Jordan

My best book is the one that I'm working on now. My best book is ALWAYS the one I'm working on now. And, as far as I'm concerned, action is always secondary. The main part of the story is the relationships between people. Those relationships sometimes lead to god-awful troubles, battles, etc., etc., but it's the relationships that are the important things.
