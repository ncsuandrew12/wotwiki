#### Brandon Sanderson

Someone asked a really good question about inspiration of Sazed's crisis of faith and religion. Brandon really opened up nicely here saying that he does a lot of research so that he can tap into how people really feel about their religions, and therefore not just argue his characters' religions from a token perspective, but hold something that feels a little more real (which he definitely succeeded with in Sazed). He said he often hits up forums for different religious beliefs and surfs there, because people tend to be very honest and passionate on forums, which gives him a nice basis to write from.
