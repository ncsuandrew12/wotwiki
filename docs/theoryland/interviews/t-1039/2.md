# [Interview #1039: Steelheart Signing Report - otomo, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1039#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was asked how many contracts he's had and has, and started to talk about the story where he had a contract for Dragonsteel and another book, which became Rithmatist. He said the first book of Dragonsteel (can't recall the name off the top of my head though I know it and too lazy to look it up at this hour) didn't turn out well, and that he wasn't ready to write that series, which ties in all of his universes as a prequel. And said he'd be avoiding more series where you have to really have read everything to get it until further down the line. Confirmed that the next several books are going to be Stormlight related, along with the in between Wax and Wayne books, Steelheart books and Rithmatist.

#### Footnote

The book in question is
*The Liar of Partinel*
