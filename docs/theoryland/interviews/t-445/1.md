# [Interview #445: Robert Jordan's Blog: A word from Harriet & Wilson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=445#1)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

On October 27, Book 12 of The Wheel of Time,
*The Gathering Storm*
, goes on sale nationally. Completed by Brandon Sanderson from notes and partials left by Robert Jordan, it is very good. I was its editor, as I was editor on ALL the Wheel books, and Maria Simons, Jordan's right hand for over 12 years, and Alan Romanczuk, Jordan's left hand (just because you can't have two right hands unless you are ... Shiva, is it?) have worked very closely with Brandon as well. We three—Harriet, Maria, and Alan—have really worked as Team Jordan on this book, and will do so on the following two, which will complete the Wheel. Book 13 will be titled
*Towers of Midnight*
, and Book 14 will be
*A Memory of Light*
.

Even Jordan couldn't have written everything he left in one volume, although he thought he could. But you recall that he thought he could write the entire Wheel in six volumes.

Try
*The Gathering Storm*
. I think you'll like it a lot. I do.

Best,
  
Harriet McDougal
