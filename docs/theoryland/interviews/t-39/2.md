# [Interview #39: LOC Signing Report - Don Harlow, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=39#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Overheard early during the signing: the history of the Da'shain Aiel is based on the history of the Cheyenne Indians during their several-generation migration from east of the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountainsâ€”a period in which every man's hand was raised against them.

#### Don Harlow

Similarity between words 'shain' and 'Cheyenne' noted by me after hearing this.
