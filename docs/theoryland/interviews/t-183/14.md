#### Question

Can you sever a person from the True Power with One Power?

#### Robert Jordan

Not in the same way. If you try to gentle a man or still a woman who's capable of using the True Power you'd have to use another method.

#### Question

So it is not only the Dark One who can stop giving the Forsaken the True Power, but they can be cut off as Asmodean was cut off.

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out on Asmodean. I'm not gonna tell you. They could be cut off, but the problem with that is, nobody knows how to do it. It is possible that some of the Forsaken themselves know how to do it, but nobody else does.

#### Question

What happens when Rand and Asmodean have this conflict and ...

#### Question

... and Rand severs his ties with the Dark One ...

#### Question

... and Rand severs some black ties. Isn't that ...

#### Robert Jordan

That was cutting off his protection from the Taint and also cut off his ability, it was not like stilling them. It was cutting the ties that, most important to him, protected him from the taint on
*saidin*
, so he could draw
*saidin*
all he wanted to and never worry about the taint. But it was also those ties that represented his ability, or the conduits by which he could draw on the True Power. But it was not his ability to draw; it was not the same thing as stilling or severing; it was more like shielding.
