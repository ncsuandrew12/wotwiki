# [Interview #183: Budapest Q&A, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#15)

#### Question

To go back to what you were saying a few minutes ago, were you implying that you could channel the True Power without being granted immortality?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh yes.

#### Question

Aren't the Forsaken already ...

#### Robert Jordan

No. They're not immortal.

#### Question

Do they know that?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, they know that.

#### Question

But they believe they are immortal.

#### Robert Jordan

No, they do not believe they are immortal, but they believe they will be. All they need to do is get the Dark One free. And they have been promised this. This is their reward for getting him free. If they manage to get him out of that prison, he will grant them immortality. And they believe this because they have seen him in the past, as he has done now, bring the dead back to life. Give the dead new bodies. Transfer souls from a dying body into a young and healthy body. They've seen him do this. So they know that can be done. So it's not as though they are believing something, somebody just walked up to you and said "I can make you immortal if you go out and do this, kill and do awful deeds". They've seen him, they have seen these incredible things done. So they have reason to believe.
