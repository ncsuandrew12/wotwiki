# [Interview #183: Budapest Q&A, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#23)

#### Question

Is it true that the Three Oaths is why Aes Sedai [mumble mumble] I thought it might be because, when you try to avoid the Three Oaths, you get a lot of dangerous situation [mumble mumble]...

#### Robert Jordan

No...now you have to be careful with this, because this is a kind of spoiler for people that haven’t read far enough, but the Oath Rod is what was in the Age of Legends called a binder. It was used on criminals. If you committed a violent act, or some sort of criminal act, with a binder, someone who could channel could be constrained from ever doing that again, and the result of having three of the Oaths, is the ageless appearance. One would not produce agelessness, but even one would shorten life, and three of them put a cap on Aes Sedai’s lives, on how long they could live.

#### Question

Does this mean that the Black Ajah has also at least three oaths sworn on the Oath Rod?

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, they do. Just not the same ones.  [laughter]

#### Question

Of course. Does this imply that the Oath Rod is definitely not one of the Nine Rods of Dominion?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh yes, definitely. No. I don't think it was. No, the Oath Rods are not the Nine Rods of Dominion, no. There were a fair number of binders available around the world.

#### Question

Were they numbered?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, they were numbered.

#### Question

Because we've seen two so far and they had numbers on them . . .

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, they were numbered.
