# [Interview #183, Entry #6]: Budapest Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#6)

#### Question

Are the Forsaken defined by being allowed to tap the True True Power?

#### Robert Jordan

No, not necessarily. They are, but it takes more than that, and they may be denied it. You see there were many more than thirteen Chosen at the time of the Breaking of the World. At the time of the sealing, there were more, and they died. The reason these thirteen lived was that they were trapped and, except for Balthamel and Aginor, sealed away in large extent from the effects of time, as if they were put in suspended animation. The others who were not there at this conference died.

#### Question

May I ask you what makes a Forsaken Forsaken, or Chosen?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, many people had sworn their souls to the Dark One. To be one of the Chosen, is to be someone who is recognized by the Dark One as having enough potential to be brought to Shayol Ghul to swear this oath personally, as close to being in the presence of the Dark One as is possible, with the prison partially sealed up.

#### Question

Is it just a coincidence that all those thirteen who survived can channel?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, no that’s no coincidence, because if you weren’t able to channel, you weren’t going to get into this game at all.

#### Question

Ah. [mumble] cannot channel?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, but somebody has to be cannon fodder.

#### Question

Yeah...poor Mat and poor Perrin.

#### Robert Jordan

Hmm, well, if they wanted to be Forsaken, yes.

#### Question

Yeah...I hope they’re not gonna be Forsaken.

#### Robert Jordan
