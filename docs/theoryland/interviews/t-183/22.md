# [Interview #183: Budapest Q&A, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#22)

#### Question

Are
*gholam*
immortal?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Question

Because they were in...a box?

#### Robert Jordan

Stasis box. A stasis box is an artifact of the Age of Legends, and is in effect an artificial vacuole. Time does not move inside a stasis box. It is a thing devised for storing things that are fragile or that might decay in some way.

#### Question

So the
*gholam*
can die by a natural death?

#### Robert Jordan

I don’t know if you’d call it a natural death, but yeah, they can decay. You saw what happened with Mat’s medallion—it just fell on the
*gholam*
’s cheek and branded it.

#### Question

But do they die of old age?

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, they do, but they live a little longer than you’d like them to, let me tell you (laughter)—not as long as an Aes Sedai, but...not as long as an Aes Sedai that hasn’t sworn the Three Oaths, anyway...not as long as a strong Aes Sedai that hasn’t sworn the Three Oaths.
