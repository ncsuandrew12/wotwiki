# [Interview #183, Entry #4]: Budapest Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#4)

#### Mort

[something about the Forsaken]

#### Robert Jordan

Essentially learned the local language.

#### Mort

They just got free and learned the local language in a few weeks or so.

#### Robert Jordan

A little more than a few weeks.

#### Mort

Wow...That's impressive! What about the first and second that were let loose?

#### Robert Jordan

They were very near the surface. It's one of the reasons for the effects on them. They were for three thousand years aware—not in a sleep like the others; aware—and more aware of what has happened in the world. And because of the way the Bore works... See, the Bore is not located at Shayol Ghul. Shayol Ghul is simply the place where the Bore is most easily sensed. The Bore is everywhere, because of the nature of the universe. And those two guys, in effect, spent the last three thousand years in a state of feeling that they had no body—they certainly had no ability to move—that they were simply trapped minds, but aware and drifting over the face of the earth, able to hear people, able to see what was happening in one area or another. They could speak the language when they came out.

#### Mort

You are talking about Aginor and Balthamel now.

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah.

#### Mort

And Ishamael as well?

#### Robert Jordan

Ishamael is a different case. Read and find out.
