# [Interview #183: Budapest Q&A, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#13)

#### Wood Sun

What about the
*saa*
? You wrote in a chapter, that there is a black hole before Moridin's eyes.

#### Robert Jordan

No, no, in the eyes. It is not before. In the eyes, inside the eyes.

#### Wood Sun

And can see through? (-?- unsure about this sentence. -?-)

#### Robert Jordan

It depends. When you are using the True Power. At first, when you begin using the True Power, there's nothing there. Nothing in the eyes. After you've used it for a while, you begin to have a black speck floating across your eyes, when you're using it.

#### Wood Sun

And then you see, other observers can see it.

#### Robert Jordan

No, you don't see it. You don't actually see it.

#### Wood Sun

I think it was the chapter when Moridin was observing with a cloak of fancloth. His vision was blurred by a rain of black spots.

#### Harriet

But it didn't affect his vision.

#### Robert Jordan

It didn't affect his vision. You're aware of it, but it's not like there is blackness between you, because it gets thicker and thicker and thicker and you get to a point where if you've used it long enough you get a steady stream even if you're not connected. And you are then on the road, at that point, inevitably, to becoming what Ishamael was. Because these are stigmata, if you will. These
*saa*
are stigmata caused by a linkage to the Dark One. And eventually the effect is to become all fire eyes. You no longer have eyes visible to other people. If they're looking into your eyes, they seem to be looking into caverns of flame that stretch to infinity. And when you open your mouth they see another cavern of flame that stretches to infinity. Because you've reached at that point the ultimate level of this usage and quite possibly, if you've at this point not been granted immortality, you're on your way to death. Not madness, but you're on your way to death. So it's sort of a race. The Dark One has given you this boon, but if you use it very much, then you'd better hope he is willing to give you another boon, because if he doesn't give you the second boon then you're dead. Some of the Forsaken have expressed discomfort with the fact that Ishamael and Moridin are so free with using the One Power.

#### Wood Sun

And is it addictive?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Wood Sun

Entirely.

#### Robert Jordan

So is the One Power. That's one of the things that I intended from the beginning. The One Power has at least the potential for good, and it is something used by those on the side of good. And it is addictive, physically and psychologically addictive and also potentially very dangerous, even deadly to those who are using it.

#### Wood Sun

And so the other Forsaken seem to be afraid of using the True Power?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, they are, because they know this; they will use it when they have to, but they limit it, because they know that if you use it enough to let the
*saa*
begin to appear, then you are on a spiral and once they begin appearing, they begin appearing more often. And eventually, unless you are given immortality by the Dark One, you are dead. Now, the thing is, they don't wanna die. This is really great, it is a really great honor to be given the ability to tap into the True Power. Which is not inherently stronger than the One Power. It's not that it is stronger in any way. It is just something that does not have some of the limitations of the One Power. Other people can't feel you embracing it, or using it, like the One Power.

#### Question

-?-

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, you could.

#### Question

-?-

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, you could burn out with the True Power.

#### Wood Sun

Only True Power, or One Power too?

#### Robert Jordan

With the True Power as well as the One Power you can burn out.
