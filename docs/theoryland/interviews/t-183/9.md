#### Question

There is one place, one continent, you wrote about it only in the Guide. It’s the Land of Madmen. What is this?

#### Robert Jordan

It is a place where was never was a White Tower, or any other organization of Aes Sedai, to effect any control over men who could channel. Therefore, no civilization was able to rise up there again after the Breaking. It is still a place where men who can channel can be found (much more). [They are] hunted by women who can channel, because they’re very dangerous. Anybody else, for that matter, if they can find a way to kill them. It’s like, if you find out you have a tiger loose in your neighborhood and you have to kill it. You can’t leave it running loose; somebody has to kill it.
