#### Question

And there is the Ring of Tamyrlin. It's just a signet ring, or . . . ?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. Again, this is something I don't know whether I'm going to put it in or not.

#### Question

Okay.

#### Robert Jordan

But you see there are things that I might want to put in, I might want to use, and giving you the answer lets it out and means I might as well not use it because . . .

#### Question

It's more interesting.

#### Question

Does Telamon mean "dragon" or does it mean "Kinslayer" or is it something else?

#### Robert Jordan

What? In Lews Therin Telamon? No, no. It means something else. That's his name. Lews Therin is the name he was born with. Telamon, a name he was given later.

#### Question

It does not mean dragon?

#### Robert Jordan

It does not mean dragon, no.

#### Question

And are dragons definitely not the same as
*raken*
and
*to'raken*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Definitely not. Definitely not.

#### Harriet McDougal

Oh that's an interesting question.

#### Question

But, I mean the name [sounds?] the same. . .

#### Robert Jordan

But no, they're definitely not. They're definitely not.

#### Harriet McDougal

They're flying creatures.

#### Question

They're like a dragon image.

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, I know they are somewhat of a dragon image. But no, they're definitely not.

#### Harriet McDougal

Oh, cool. That's a wonderful thing to have noticed. That's great.

#### Robert Jordan

Although who can say what may be said in the next Age? Remember, things get repeated, things get distorted. And what the next Age believes is true history of a previous Age may not be in any way close to what actually happened. So who knows?

#### Question

So was . . .  In the Age of Legends, a dragon was a completely symbolic thing? It did not refer to an actual creature?

#### Robert Jordan

Not to an actual creature. But beyond that, read and find out.

#### Question

Did they have dragons like . . . ?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it was symbolic at that time. There were no dragons flying around in the Age of Legends, no.

#### Question

And did they have [inaudible...]

#### Robert Jordan

They named this man the dragon as a symbol. And his banner was a dragon as a symbol.

#### Question

[inaudible]

#### Robert Jordan

No, that . . . I think you better read and find out.  Again, I don't know if I'm going to use it, but I don't want to put out too much.

#### Question

So if you don't use it, after you finish the series, we come back to this question.

#### Robert Jordan

Okay, okay.
