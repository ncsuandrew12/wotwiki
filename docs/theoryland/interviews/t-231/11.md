#### Question

Why can't Shadowspawn pass through gateways?

#### Robert Jordan

It's because they're artificial constructs. They can't tolerate the passage.

#### Question

So would a Nym have the same problem?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Question

How about Ogier?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Ogier are not artificial constructs.
