#### Robert Jordan

He really doesn't like Apple. It was hard to hear this answer, but he was saying something about how he started writing on the Apple II, and when he switched to Apple 3, the file formats changed, and he couldn't get to any of his data. The same thing happened again when he moved to the Mac, and so he swore he would never buy anything Apple again. He says the only thing from Apple that he uses now is Quicktime.
