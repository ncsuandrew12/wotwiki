#### Question

Was Mat's use of crossbows in
*Knife of Dreams*
based on the way crossbows were really used?

#### Robert Jordan

The thing that made crossbows better than longbows was that you could train someone to use a crossbow much faster than you could train them to use a bow. Then when muskets came along, they were better because they didn't require much training, and the firing rate was improved.
