Robert?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes?

Ready?

#### Shawnyve

How exactly do Wells work, if a person is in a place where they cannot sense
*saidar*
then how do they embrace to channel from the Well? And can you use a Well when you are shielded from the Source?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out!

#### Kell

What are your feelings about the card game and upcoming role-playing game based on WoT?

#### Robert Jordan

So far I've heard only good things. I don't know how much I'll be involved.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#4)

#### Mathew-E

Sir, I truly enjoy reading the sword fighting scenes, could you give us some background information on where you got the names for the various forms used?

#### Robert Jordan

The names are creations of my own, but they're based on Japanese and Chinese techniques and European techniques pre-gunpowder.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#5)

#### samugi

With the storyline as it is now it seems unlikely that the new book will finish the series. How many more books do you feel will be in this series?

#### Robert Jordan

There will be at least three more books. I've known the last scene of the last book for 15 years, but I've always been overly optimistic about how much I can get into any one book, so hopefully three more.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#6)

#### ArabianKn

Mr. Jordan, since Gaidal Cain has been born only recently in the WOT universe, how is it that he will grow old enough to fight in the upcoming battle (Tarmon Gai'don)? It will take at least 15 years for him to grow big enough to fight. and what about the other Heroes? Will they also be reborn, or will they remain to be recalled only by the Horn?

#### Robert Jordan

Who says that what Gaidal has been reborn to do is to fight the Last Battle? There is more to do to keep the Pattern on course than the Last Battle.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#7)

#### Rhodric

What was Lews Therin's age at the time of the sealng of the Bore, and was his prowess with the sword (and Sammael's) comparable to modern blademasters?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out!

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#8)

#### Jenn703

Mr. Jordan, do you ever find yourself "corrupted" by the ideas put forth in such places as on the FAQ?

#### Robert Jordan

No I rarely go online. Occasionally I look at a website, but I'm writing my story for me. Not to please everybody else. :)

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#9)

#### samugi

The Wheel of Time series is very popular and I believe the PC game using the unreal engine has done very well. Have there been any plans to branch into other media such as film or tv?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, NBC has an option for a miniseries, but I understand the option is unlikely to be renewed. I guess you can write to the network.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#10)

#### phoenix1356

Mr. Jordan, as a witch I would like to thank and compliment you on your explanation of the elemental powers.

#### Robert Jordan

I've been reading about elemental powers for years; glad you like it.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#11)

#### Balerion

There's a suggestion in the books that Lanfear was believed to be as strong as any female channeler could ever become. What was the reason for that belief?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out!

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#12)

#### Tamyrlin

Has a
*gholam*
ever been in Caemlyn?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out! :)

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#13)

#### Linda

If an Aes Sedai links with other Aes Sedai, will or can the others then sense if she is bonded? Also, can an Aes Sedai (at least as far as the Tower knows) 'unbond' a Warder? It's been suggested that they will set a man free/release him if he really wants to leave, but does that mean 'unbond' him or simply 'not pursue' him and release him from whatever oaths he's sworn as a Warder?

#### Robert Jordan

No. They can't sense it. I think you may be thinking about an adaption of bonds.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#14)

#### LadyJ

Mr. Jordan, are you as into writing and telling us this story as you were when you started the series?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. Every bit. I don't take time to do much else. In large part because I enjoy the story.

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#15)

#### Kelton

Mr. Jordan, I would like to thank you on behalf of everyone at the Dancing Dragon Tavern for creating such a wonderful series of books, if it weren't for you and your books we wouldn't be the group of close-knit friends we have become. Would you possibly consider mentioning the tavern in passing in one of your future books?

#### Robert Jordan

(no response)

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#16)

#### Fetch

Also, is there a set number of books that you are going to write?

#### Robert Jordan

There is no set number. It takes as much space as it takes.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#17)

#### ArabianKn

Mr. Jordan, Whenever a channeler draws on the One Power, does he/she become temporarily outside the Wheel's control? I ask this because Min's viewings of Aes Sedai get fuzzy whenever they draw on the Power and in
*Lord of Chaos*
Egwene avoids Rand's
*ta'veren*
effect by drawing on
*saidar*
.

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out!

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#18)

#### dragoman

How does Mat's medallion damage the
*gholam*
? Also, what significance to the Seanchan does his spear have?

#### Robert Jordan

Laughing... Read and Find out. If I tell you, you get bored with the new books!

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#19)

#### Mormegil

In
*Winter's Heart*
, Lews Therin says, "We are not builders, not you, or I, or the other one." Now I know if I ask who the other one is, I know I'll just get a RAFO, but should we be able to figure out who the 'other one' is?

#### Robert Jordan

You should have some hints. Follow your hunches.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#20)

#### Shawnyve

An odd question, What exactly does it mean when you describe the clothing in the Wheel of Time as being 'blue slashed with cream'? Is there any historical dress in that still to get a more accurate picture of how you describe it?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. There is a historical dress much like it. A gap that can close or open. It's been used throughout European history.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#21)

#### Monkeyman

Nobody who can channel
*saidin*
or
*saidar*
can sense the True Power. And, since the Forsaken don't seem to notice Moridin channeling the True Power, is it detectable at all (besides by a
*gholam*
)? That is, can someone already holding the True Power sense another using it?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Not by any method we've seen yet.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#22)

#### LadyJ

Mr. Jordan, How much of the story is already planned out in your mind, and how much is supplied as you go along in the writing process?

#### Robert Jordan

I know the major outline of the story. Various characters' lives. Who lives and dies. The fates of nations. And I know the final scene. Minor details, or smaller details, I leave until I'm writing. It flows organically that way. I thought it would take five books, by the way. :) I was optimistic!

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#23)

#### Fetch

Did you draw on folklore and mythologies for your books? Specifically, Mat as a parallel to Odin, with his spear that has Thought and Memory on it (Odin's ravens) and the distinct possibility that he's gonna lose an eye sometime soon?

#### Robert Jordan

I've tried to reverse engineer myths and legends. As if this was a game of whispers. By the time the whisper travels around the room it changes. The legends of the world today are what the last child said. I'm trying to remember what was on the original paper. Yes, Odin, yes Rand has Arthur in him. But the stories have changed so... So the legends are ultimately not at all alike.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#24)

#### Ran

Are Dreaming and Dreamwalking essentially just different names for the same Talent, or are they separate Talents that often occur together? The illustrated guide seemed to confuse the issue somewhat.

#### Robert Jordan

No. They're very different. A Dreamwalker can enter dreams. But a Dreamer only "understands" dreams, though Dreamwalkers are generally Dreamers, too.

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#25)

#### Vsove

Are you going to put out an updated Guide? The old one's becoming increasingly out of date.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, probably not until the series finished. But I do think it would be a great thing to do then. I have some notes for it.

## [Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#26)

#### Jahar

Mr Jordan. I was a bit disappointed in
*Winter's Heart*
. The last chapter in
*The Path of Daggers*
has the Salidar Aes Sedai stepping through a gateway in eyesight of Dragonmount. In
*Winter's Heart*
, you have them still in Murandy. Did they get too cold to stay??

#### Robert Jordan

No.
*Winter's Heart*
overlaps the ending of the last book.

## [Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#27)

#### Vsove

What events looked like they had Demandred's hand in them? I refer to the comment about proxies.

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out!

## [Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#28)

#### Nevik

Can you give some more details on how the taint was cleansed? I was sort of confused reading the book.

#### Robert Jordan

Sorry...I can't.

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#29)

#### LadyJ

Mr. Jordan, How do you keep track of all the sub-plots and names and lives? Do you have a room decorated with color-coded index cards?

#### Robert Jordan

I keep track of them in my head. I have some files if I need them. And I have many cultural files. But the story and the lives are all in my head.

## [Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#30)

#### Vsove

What exactly IS a Nine-horse hitch? C'mon, tell us ;) We can handle it...we're all big boys and girls.

#### Robert Jordan

If you don't know already REALLY you aren't old enough.

## [Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#31)

#### Crysa

I was wondering if there have been any other authors approach you about writing other ages, such as the Age of Legends or Hawkwing's time? If they did, would you allow it?

#### Robert Jordan

I've never been approached. And no, I wouldn't. When I'm done I'll move on to another Universe.

## [Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#32)

#### Akira

Mr. Jordan, do you have any advice for aspiring fantasy writers (such as myself)?

#### Robert Jordan

Write. When you've written something send it out. As soon as it's in the mail write more. Never stop writing and never stop sending material out. Write and keep writing. And keep trying to get published. If a story is on the shelf it isn't writing. Whatever you've written isn't complete without a reader.

## [Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#33)

#### Star

What religions have influenced your creation of the Creator and the Dark One?

#### Robert Jordan

Christianity. Islam. Judaism. And bits of heretical writing within those faiths. I hasten to add I'm not endorsing anything. I'm just a writer. I tell stories.

## [Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#34)

#### Brian

Are some characters easier to write than others? As I write I find that to be the case.

#### Robert Jordan

In general, female characters are harder to write. I have a tough time getting into their skin. Obviously I've never been a woman. It's also hard to get into the skin of really evil characters. Rand is the easiest.

## [Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#35)

#### Alystrial

Mr. Jordan, I know that this series has been your life's work, and great work it is. What I would like to know is how old were you when your had you first "insight" to or for the series, and what inspired you to write the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

I guess I began thinking about what would become the series in my 20s and that was a long time ago. I spent ten years juggling things in my head before I even tried writing it down.

## [Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#36)

#### Moderator

Thanks Robert. I know you've had a long day. Good night.

#### Robert Jordan

Good night. Thanks for having me. Read the book everybody!

#### Moderator

Thanks for the great questions everybody, we'll be chatting with another author in two weeks. Remember...This chat was cosponsored by Asimov's Science Fiction, www.asimovs.com. You'll also find great stories here on SCIFI as part of our SCI Fiction series edited by Ellen Datlow. We'll open the floor now.
