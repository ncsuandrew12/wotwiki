# [Interview #933: AMOL Signing Report - JeffS, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=933#3)

#### JeffS

Out of 3 pet theories of mine:
  
One shot down in flames
  
One, could be but I ain't sayin'
  
One, confirmed but by an Aes Sedai answer WHICH ROCKED, once I got my head out and actually thought it through.

I can't expand at this time as I swore "Under the Light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth" that I would not divulge the information. Don't ask Wetlander either as she also swore and as she was dressed as Cadsuane, I'm sure she would feel even more bound by propriety...
