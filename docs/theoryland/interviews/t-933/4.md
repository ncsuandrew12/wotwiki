# [Interview #933, Entry #4]: AMOL Signing Report - JeffS](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=933#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

During the personalization signings, someone asked what the deal was with Alanna's move north and Brandon said unequivocally that she was kidnapped. He didn't say by whom, but I figure since the report to Cadsuane said there were not any residues of channeling to read, it must have been Moridin himself using the True Power.

#### JeffS

So that's one more down of the 7 left unasked.
