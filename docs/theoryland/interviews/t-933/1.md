# [Interview #933: AMOL Signing Report - JeffS, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=933#1)

#### JeffS

I'll probably post more on the Seattle signing later but it's after midnight and I'm starting to fuzz out around the edges.

Nice to meet you and your daughter Billiam. And on a school night even.

Harriet was as gracious as you would expect and Brandon was really fun when we got him chatting in "Fan" mode.

We had a large crowd, close to 400 I would guess, but it went smoothly.

My favorite signing was a young lady that asked Brandon to inscribe a copy of AMOL with "Good luck on your Midterm tomorrow" for her friend who was in the middle of cramming for an upper level math test. I really hope it helps.

Last impression for the night. Every face had a smile when leaving, including mine.
