Hello everyone,

I made it to bed by 1:00 AM but had to be up at 5:00 to head to work. I'm still tired but I can add a bit to Wetlander's post above.

James' sister Melody was our honorary and then fully vested last minute Memory Keeper. She was a big help and really enjoyed being there. Heck, we all had a ton of fun. Emelie and I ran the combination raffle and trivia contest. Some questions I thought were easy had only 3 right answers the whole night.
