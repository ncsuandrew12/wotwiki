## [Entry #4](./t-1071/4)

#### Pinpoint

Belief has had a lot to do with the cosmere. (for example in
*Warbreaker*
. The appearances of the Returned had a lot to do with belief) Will belief have a big part to play in The Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It already has. The two scholars measuring the spren.

#### Footnote

Brandon is refering to the ardents Geranid and Ashir for Interlude 8 of
*The Way of Kings*
