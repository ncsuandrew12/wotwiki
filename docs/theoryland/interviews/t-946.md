Had a great time yesterday at the signing in Milford NH!

@Wetlandernw—Fantastic job on the crossword—not easy by any stretch, and some really interesting clues. It was obvious that you put a lot of work into it, so thank you for all of your efforts! I even managed to win one of the awesome WOT backpacks with my single raffle ticket that I earned by answering one of the trivia questions taken from the puzzle. :)

—thanks for posting—we weren't able to hear all three of your questions, so I had been wondering what we missed!

#### KJacobs

I managed to get in one question of my own: Do we know how many total letters Verin wrote, and did they all reach their intended destinations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon smiled, and of course said, "Well,
*I*
know, but
*you*
don't." :) I immediately rephrased to 'Will we know?', to which he responded that yes, all of the letters were delivered, and he believed that further details were forthcoming in the Encyclopedia.

The evening ran very late—the event was scheduled from 2:00-5:00 and the signing portion started at 3:00; we made it through the line around 6:15, and there must have been at least 50-60 people still waiting behind us. The theater could seat 460, and I estimate that the crowd reached somewhere in the neighborhood of 375-400. Poor Brandon was definitely feeling under the weather, and his voice was pretty rough, but he was incredibly warm & gracious with his time regardless. My husband got some nice pictures, but I can't quite figure out how to post them into the thread. :(

All in all, a very memorable day!
