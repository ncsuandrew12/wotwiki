#### Question

My question is actually for a friend of mine who was planning to come and had some health problems, but he asked me to ask you, with regard to Mat, whether or not in the upcoming book or any that we've already seen that we're not aware of, any of Mat's memories are contemporary with each other in essentially opposing sides of a battlefield.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah. Yes. You have before. [To Maria] You're wanting to nod. [To questioner.] Maria's here. [To Maria] Do you want to handle this one?

#### Maria Simons

I can't remember details, but there's a scene where Mat remembers being on both sides of a battle.

#### Fans

Because he rode for and against Hawkwing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So in this last book, Mat's memories will certainly play a part. That's a very nice RAFO.
