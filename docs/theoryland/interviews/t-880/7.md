# [Interview #880, Entry #7]: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#7)

#### Question

[Side note: One person almost got himself lynched by asking a somewhat spoilery question, regardless of what people had been instructed...] Some characters die in
*A Memory of Light*
. How do you choose which characters to kill and which to keep alive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[My note: Brandon tried to keep this out of spoilers and make it more general about writing and dealing with killing characters off in general.] In this book, Robert Jordan had left very specific instructions regarding the fates of some characters. He left a lot of notes, and some of those determined their fate. In general, characters have to be allowed to take risks in order to create a compelling story. There has to be a real danger for them, or the characters fall flat. Sometimes, that means characters are going to die. (Brandon added a nice bit that made the crowd laugh: "Which character can I kill off that will really piss everyone off and which no one expects?")
