# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#16)

#### Jhirrad

I'd like to close with something one of the other Memory Keepers sent to me. It was very touching and a feeling that I personally share:

"I am not the oldest of the series, or the youngest one. I wasn't the first to read it and sure as sky I won't be the last. What I am is your average Wheel of Time fan. And I had a bittersweet taste in my mouth after the event. I didn't know what it was at first but it was a realization that I was with hundreds of people who waited just as I waited for this day, to finally get closure to a story that we love so much, to finally finish what I have started nine years ago. And during all that time, never once I needed a fake smile. I was happy. The drive home, however, was sad for the very same reason. Knowing that this was it. Wheel of Time. No more. In the Wheel of Time there are no beginnings or endings, but this is an end."
