#### Question

How was the Old Tongue created?

#### Harriet McDougal

Jim had books on almost every language in the world in his study. He drew inspiration from those.

#### Maria Simons

A lot of it comes from those and at the same time a lot was just his own creativity in adapting that into this world which he has created.
