# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#4)

#### Question

How do you keep track of all those characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lots of use of online resources. Also, Maria and Alan are invaluable assets for that. Brandon told a funny story about trying to figure out who was with Perrin, and Maria pulled out some notes from Robert Jordan that had a list of every single person from the Two Rivers that came with Perrin! Brandon also said he thinks there are more than 2800 named characters throughout the entire series.

#### Footnote

Brandon has told the story of the "with Perrin" file a numer of times before; in this
[example from 2009](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=422#8)
, the person he said that he queried was Alan. Other times, he has just cited "RJ's assistants".
