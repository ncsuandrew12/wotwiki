# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#15)

#### Jhirrad

As the line continued to shrink and the clock drew closer to midnight, we all withdrew together to the signing area. We had more discussions with fans about the series, making certain to keep the conversation spoiler-free.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon talked about the other things he has coming out, including
*Steelheart*
, and the new Stormlight Archive book (due in November!).

#### Jhirrad

We named the AMAZING Trolloc doll he was given (Narg Jr.) and congratulated him on the upcoming birth of his third child. We watched people come through the line with nearly thirty books to be signed (this was at the end, when Brandon would sign any number), and the joy on their faces was great.
