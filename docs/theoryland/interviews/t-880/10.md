#### Question

How much was already completed when you took over the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon referred to what Tom Doherty had previously said on the issue. He said there were about 200 pages when he took over. Also, the Epilogue in
*A Memory of Light*
was almost entirely written by Jordan with Brandon trying to bring everything else to that point.
