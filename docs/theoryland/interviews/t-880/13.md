# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#13)

#### Question

How did you choose Brandon to finish this series?

#### Harriet McDougal

A friend had provided the eulogy which Brandon wrote for Robert Jordan on his website, and it was moving. So, Harriet called Tom Doherty and asked for one of Brandon's books. He sent her the first Mistborn book. She then told how she can't stop reading a book, can't fall asleep if she starts, if she doesn't know yet if those characters are "in good hands". After 47 pages, she fell asleep, not because she was bored, but because she knew that Brandon's characters were in good hands. She called Tom Doherty and told him this was the man to finish The Wheel of Time.
