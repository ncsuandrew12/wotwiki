# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#6)

#### Question

Did Brandon insert a character in the story based on himself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. He did however mention two items, one for Robert Jordan, one for him. In the
*ter'angreal*
cache found in Ebou Dar, there is a man with a beard statue. The power of the item is to be like an easily movable library. [MY NOTE: We see this in
*A Memory of Light*
.] This was Robert Jordan. Brandon then told the story of how he got his sword, with the dragon scabbard, while in Mr. Jordan's home in South Carolina, and meeting with Wilson. That sword appears in the book, and is the one which Rand gives to Tam in
*A Memory of Light*
. So Brandon's sword is in the book, but not Brandon himself.

#### Footnote

RJ referred to his appearance in the form of the bearded man
*ter'angreal*
as his
["Alfred Hitchcock moment"](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=211#4)
. Aviendha first discovered the use of the bearded man
*ter'angreal*
in
*Knife of Dreams*
15. Brandon's sword appears in
*A Memory of Light*
15.
