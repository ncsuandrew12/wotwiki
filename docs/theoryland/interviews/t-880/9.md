# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#9)

#### Question

Who was the Aiel woman that Aviendha met on her trip to Rhuidean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nakomi. Also, RAFO, there's a hint in
*A Memory of Light*
.

(Later in the evening, he said that hint can be found between the chapter "The Last Battle" and the end of the book. He also said she came from deep in Jordan's notes, and he did not feel like he could give more information than that. Also, she might be explained in the encyclopedia, but no promises regarding that.)

#### Footnote

This Q&A was later clarified by a
[Twitter conversation](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#12)
in which Brandon said that
*something*
he found deep in RJ's notes made him include Nakomi. He refused to confirm that Nakomi actually was in the notes.
