# [Interview #880: AMOL Signing Report - Jhirrad, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=880#2)

#### Jhirrad

The event started for me when the other Memory Keepers began to trickle in around 3:00 p.m. By 5:30, four of the seven had arrived. We were expecting Brandon, Harriet, and Maria at 6:00, but Harriet and Maria decided to arrive a bit earlier (at 5:30), which ended up being an incredible gift for us. When the Barnes & Noble CRM told us that Harriet had arrived, I felt my heart start beating a little faster, and I remembered what it was like to be genuinely nervous for the first time in quite a while. I was about to meet the woman that helped guide the creation of one of my favorite things in the world! We met her at the top of the stairs, and then escorted her and Maria to the room where we would get to hang out.

For the next hour and a half, that's what we did. We really just hung out. There was a little talk about the book, but not much, since most people hadn't finished reading yet. Harriet asked if any had finished, and when I said I had, she asked for my opinion. I gave it openly and honestly, telling her of my love for this book, as well as the entire series. I expressed my gratitude to her, Brandon, Maria, and of course forever to Robert Jordan, for what they brought to us. But most of the time, we just talked about life.

#### Harriet McDougal

Harriet talked about South Carolina. We heard stories about their lives there, about the "Night Hell Froze Over" as Harriet called it, and so much more.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon talked about what Magic decks he likes to play.

#### Jhirrad

We literally talked about the weather, comparing Chicago to Charleston. In so many ways I find myself grateful that we were so early and that most people hadn't finished reading yet. If they had, the entire time would have been spent discussing specifics of the book. Instead, we were able to spend time with these three incredible and amazing people who have touched our lives, and to do so just as regular people, as friends, sitting around the table and trading stories. It was mesmerizing.
