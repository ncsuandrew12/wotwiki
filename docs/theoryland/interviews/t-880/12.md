#### Question

In a charity drive, a lot of people were chosen to have their names inserted into
*A Memory of Light*
; specifically, we were told a large group would consist of these people. Who are they in the book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Dragonsworn. Aes Sedai have joined this group, and many others. That's where they were added.
