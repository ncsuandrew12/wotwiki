#### Question

We know the Aes Sedai don't use a lot of the
*ter'angreal*
they have in their possession in the manner in which they are meant to be used. Specifically, what are the correct uses for the
*ter'angreal*
used to raise a novice to Accepted and an Accepted to Aes Sedai?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have no idea.
