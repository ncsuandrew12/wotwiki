#### Brandon Sanderson

I've got the Photoshop contest winners below, but first the weekly updates. In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations I discuss
[TenSoon's visit to Urteau](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/331/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fifty-Nine)
and
[Vin attacking without using Allomancy](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/332/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Sixty)
.

This past weekend was BYU's science fiction/fantasy symposium, Life, the Universe & Everything. This was my first convention as Guest of Honor (as well as my first con after the release of
*The Gathering Storm*
), and there was a huge crowd—including our largest crowd ever for an episode of Writing Excuses, several of which we recorded at the con. Up first—airing as this week's episode—James Dashner joined Dan, Howard, and me to discuss pacing.

. I also did a couple of interviews during the convention; one with Provo's Daily Herald resulted in a video that they've put up

.

My assistant also sent out a newsletter to everyone on my mailing list for the first time in almost four years. I've posted a copy
[here](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/60/Brandon-Sanderson-Newsletter-for-February-2010)
. Baby pictures included! The newsletter is mostly for the benefit of people who don't come to my site very often, but if you tell me what city you're in, I also send out reminders when I'm signing nearby. Consider putting your name on the list; anyone who
[sends me an email](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/contact)
gets added.
