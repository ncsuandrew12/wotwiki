# [Interview #494: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Photoshop Contest Winners, Wheel of Time Games, & Updates, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=494#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

And now to the Photoshop contest. I recruited Maria from Team Jordan, Jason and Jenn from Dragonmount, and my assistant Peter to help judge, and we eventually settled on winners for first, second, and third place. I also picked two Judge's Choice winners from other entries I found especially deserving.

FIRST PLACE

This picture of Tam holding a baby iPad Photoshopped by John S. fits in such a creepy way. As the big winner, John picked a copy of the hardcover
*Able One*
by Ben Bova for me to buy from Mysterious Galaxy and have shipped to him. He also gets a signed copy of Mistborn. Congratulations, John!

SECOND PLACE

I can't believe all the things people did with my head in this contest! Laird Duncan wins a copy of
*Imager*
by L. E. Modesitt, plus a signed copy of Mistborn.

THIRD PLACE

This one had the judges cracking up. Gavin Doyle wins a copy of
*The Revolution Business*
by Charlie Stross (and a signed copy of Mistborn).

These entries by Michael Willett (left) and Valeryan (right) get special Judge's Choice awards. Michael's Photoshopping is just so good here, and the whole concept fits so well. And I couldn't stop laughing when I saw Valeryan's entry the first timeâ€”I imagined Lews Therin rocking out to Journey's greatest hits, unable to keep the tears in. (Valeryan, you haven't responded to my assistant yet, so I don't know whether you want me to send you a copy of the Mistborn Table of Allomantic Metals or the Mistborn paperback. Please check your email!) Both of you have my highest appreciation for your skill and excecution.

The full slate of entries is up in a
