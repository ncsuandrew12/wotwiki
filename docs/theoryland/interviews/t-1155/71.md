#### Question

Question about feruchemy and allomancy… what does it take to match allomantic pewter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He imagines that baseline pewter doubles strength, flaring triples. He wouldn’t imagine someone burning pewter and lifting a car. Hasn’t thought about speed and healing. He’s admitting he hasn’t canonized these things.
