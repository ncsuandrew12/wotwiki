#### Question

Is there a correlation between Awakening steel (Questioner later clarifies that by this he means making Nightblood), and summoning a sprenblade (Brandon tries to get him to clarify, live or dead sprenblade, but I don’t think they ended up on exactly the same page).

#### Brandon Sanderson

Similar but different things. There is a correlation, but (trails off)
