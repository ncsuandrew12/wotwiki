# [Interview #1155: Calamity-Philadelphia, PA, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1155#1)

#### Question

So for Calamity, like about these others that you mentioned, are we ever going to figure that out? Or--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah, so the next series I’m doing deals with the greater-- sort of interdimensional travel and who are these people.

#### Question

Okay good, because I was like “You can’t leave me like this” at the very end. I really like how it was put together and stuff. My own theories were that David was, his powers were figuring out Epics’ weaknesses—

#### Brandon Sanderson

I considered that, I really did. At the end of the day, when I brainstormed the trilogy I said you know what would be most fun for me in this series is to do a trilogy that is basically an origin story for a character and then when I come back to The Reckoners, if I do, because the next one’s a parallel dimension, right?

#### Question

From where Firefight is? Or another--

#### Brandon Sanderson

That-- We will get into why certain ones are stable and certain ones aren’t and why Megan can pull from and we’ll do something there with a new character. And if I come back, then Mizzy will be the main character in the sequel series.

#### Question

Awesome, […] looking forward to more Mizzy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Does that make sense? That’s where the plan for this is, we’ll see how the new series goes, they’re announcing it next week. And the entirety of the magic system is based on interdimensional stuff.

#### Question

Right, especially with Megan and her--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep.

#### Question

--multiple hundred personalities coming together and stuff.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So it’s kind of like Megan has opened up this idea of a quantum multiverse, and now I’m going to do a quantum multiverse which is not something I can deal with in the cosmere so it’s exciting for me to be able to do it.

#### Question

Yeah ‘cause the first one we see about the others I was like […] this is not the cosmere.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not cosmere. Going straight-up quantum multiverse, in kind of a classical sense. I’ve been doing a lot of reading on string theory and things. It’s so hard, string theory breaks my brain. Quantum mechanics break my brain, but they’re fun.
