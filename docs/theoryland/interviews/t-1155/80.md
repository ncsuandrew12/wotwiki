#### Question

If you were gonna build a Cosmere Avengers, who would you have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He doesn’t wanna talk about this to pre-dispose people. He’d have answered if it weren’t being recorded. He’d want someone from every magic system. Would the name of the team be a spoiler? He says, “I haven’t thought about it.” Then he starts talking about the 17th Shard but stops because the guy thinks this is his answer to the question, it doesn’t seem like he really wanted to give that as the simple answer.
