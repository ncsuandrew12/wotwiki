#### Brandon Sanderson

Do you have a question for me? Tor.com is soliciting questions
[for the next three days](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/12/open-call-for-brandon-sanderson-questions)
which they'll then compile and send my way. I'm also taking questions on Goodreads's Fantasy Book Club this month. They have one thread for questions about
[*The Way of Kings*](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings)
and another thread for
[*Towers of Midnight*](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446240-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-towers-of-midnight)
. I'll probably start answering them this week.
