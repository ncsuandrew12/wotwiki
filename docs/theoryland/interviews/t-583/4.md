[cage match](http://suvudu.com/cage-match)
a while back that Rand al'Thor won, narrowly beating Jaime Lannister from the A Song of Ice and Fire series? Well, Suvudu recently did a villains cage match, and its winner, Ser Gregor Clegane (also from ASoIaF)
[will be facing off](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2010/11/cage-match-villains-we-have-a-winner.html)
against Rand in a hero vs. villain final battle. If you think you know how such a battle would go, Suvudu is soliciting writeups. See
[their post](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2010/11/cage-match-villains-we-have-a-winner.html)
for details.
