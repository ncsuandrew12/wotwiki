# [Interview #583: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Questions, 30% Off Sale, Signings, Awards & Updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=583#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Dragons & Fairy Tales bookstore has a 30% off sale on all Brandon Sanderson books through December 17th. They have copies of almost all of my books (they sold out of
*Alcatraz*
4, but they do have a bunch of the first three
*Alcatraz*
books), and some of them are signed. They will ship. Call them at (801) 789-5014 or stop by the store.

I'll be signing in Murray this weekend and in Bountiful the weekend after that. Details are on my events page. Unfortunately, it looks like the Murray Borders will not get any copies of
*Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens*
, but the Bountiful Barnes & Noble already received at least 35 copies. If you plan to come to the Bountiful signing but want to buy the book now, stop by the store and pick it up, then bring it back to the signing. They also have a large number of the previous
*Alcatraz*
books and my other titles.

This week on the Writing Excuses podcast, Howard Tayler and I are once again joined by Scott Westerfeld to discuss
[steampunk](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/12/05/)
. And recent
*Warbreaker*
annotations talk about
[Lightsong trying pottery](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/408/Warbreaker-Chapter-Thirty)
and
[Vivenna meeting with the slumlords](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/409/Warbreaker-Chapter-Thirty-One)
.
