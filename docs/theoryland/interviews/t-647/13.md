Do you think you're going to do any more prequel stories like the one you did in
*Legends*
?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

No?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, let me change that. Stories, maybe. But when I finish the Wheel of Time I have no intention of doing novels that are prequels or sequels. I'm going to go to another fantasy universe, another world, another set of characters, another set of cultures, another set of rules. I won't say that I'll never do something like that, but I have no plans to.
