# [Interview #647: Author's Table Interview, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=647#15)

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

Do you have something in mind for when you finish the Wheel of Time series?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, yes. I've been thinking about it for six or seven years now. My working title for it is "Shipwreck." It is an entirely different universe, as I've said. Someone I told about this said its fantasy "Shogun." I wouldn't say that exactly, but if somebody needed a high concept version of it, I guess you could call it that.
