#### Rochelle O'Gorman

I know you have used the pseudonyms Reagan O'Neal and Jackson O'Reilly in the past. Why?

#### Robert Jordan

To keep different genres separate. The other books were written before I began The Wheel of Time, and my publisher has re-issued them and insisted on doing them as "Robert Jordan writing as." But, I made them put the other pen name as large as possible on the cover so that they didn't do "ROBERT JORDAN writing as." As it was, I didn't want anybody to think that they were getting a new Robert Jordan novel, when what they were getting was a historical novel or a western that I wrote 15 or 20 years ago.

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

You're not doing those anymore, then?

#### Robert Jordan

No. I'm not saying I won't ever do them again.
