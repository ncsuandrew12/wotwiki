Rochelle O'Gorman has been an entertainment critic for 17 years. She has covered movies, video, books and theater before finding her niche in audiobooks. Turning in her crown as queen of the B movies, she happily exchanged bad Mexican vampire flicks for her true love: literature. She listens to about 200 audiobooks a year as she cooks, showers, weaves, exercises and drives. Her biggest fear is that she will still hear voices once she turns off her tape player.

O'Gorman's audiobook reviews can be found in the
*Boston Globe*
,
*New York Post*
,
*L.A. Times*
,
*Oregonian*
,
*Seattle Times*
,
*Hartford Courant*
and
*Book*
magazine. She still reviews videos for
*Pulse!*
magazine and is a chief contributor to the "Video Movie Guide," a yearly compendium. She and two insane cats share the hayloft of a 200-year-old barn on the East Coast.
