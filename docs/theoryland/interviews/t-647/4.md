#### Rochelle O'Gorman

How long did it take you to formulate the Wheel of Time series before you started the first book? Had you had this ruminating in your mind?

#### Robert Jordan

Extending back to the first clear thought I had that I can say led into the Wheel of Time was maybe 10 years before I began writing. I'm not saying I knew 10 years before I began writing what it was going to be, or that I was actually on to something that would become the Wheel of Time.

I thought I had a story set in my head, a set of stories, fixed. And when I began writing the Wheel of Time—
*The Eye of the World*
in particular—I realized I didn't have as much of it as clear as I thought I did. There were things that I needed to work on. So
*The Eye of the World*
took me four years to write. I guess you could say, in a way, it was about 14 years of development to get the thing set.

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

Did you ever think it was going to turn into this epic series?

#### Robert Jordan

No. The story is the same story that I set out to tell. I knew before I began writing what the story was. There were details of how it worked that I didn't have fixed that I thought I knew and suddenly realized I didn't. But, I knew the beginning and the end and the things that I wanted to happen in the middle. I literally could have written the last scene of the last book before I began writing
*The Eye of the World*
. The problem has been over-optimism.

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

In what way?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, when I went to the publisher with this at Tor Books and I said, "Look, this isn't a trilogy that I'm talking about. It's going to be four or maybe five books." I said. "It could be six. I don't think so, but it could be." And I really believed that. But the over-optimism has been, "How much of the story can I get into one book?"

With every book I start out thinking I can get more of the story into this book than I actually turn out to be able to. I suddenly realize that I have to stop here or I'm going to have to write another thousand pages to really make it fit together. Or I realize that I'm going to have to take some things and do them later or I'm going to write a 2,000-page hardback, which they really would have to sell to people with a shoulder strap.
