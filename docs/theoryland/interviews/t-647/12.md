# [Interview #647: Author's Table Interview, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=647#12)

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

How do you keep track of everything? There are a lot of characters in your books, so what do you do? Do you keep a chart on the wall?

#### Robert Jordan

No. No. No. Mainly I do it in my head. I have voluminous notes on my computer. But I realize 95 percent of the time that when I go to the notes, it is actually to add in new things that I have decided to say or do about a character or a nation or a culture or an organization. These things can get huge.

I do not usually go in to find out things. It's as if the act of having put the information into the file has helped me remember it. I don't say that it's 100 percent. I do have to sometimes go in and check to be sure about a particular character, somebody who's not a major character, exactly how did I spell her name? Or, did I say what color his eyes were?
