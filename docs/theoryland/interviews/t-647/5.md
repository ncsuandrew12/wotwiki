#### Rochelle O'Gorman

I've heard that you're going to have 13 books in the series. Is that true?

#### Robert Jordan

I've heard that myself. I just put out the ninth book,
*Winter's Heart*
. And as I tell people, there are going to be at least three more books. Now, I say, "at least." I cannot see how to finish it in fewer than three, how to get to that final scene. If I can do it in three more, I will, but I'm not promising. I apologize to people about that. I'm really sorry. I never set out to write a mega-epic as far as the number of pages go.

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

Why would you possibly apologize? Obviously people want it.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, yes, I know but . . .

I still love writing it as much as when I started. But in a way I also feel impatience with myself. Until I complete the Wheel of Time I haven't really done it, if you understand what I mean. It's like a football player takes the kickoff on the one and then runs to the opposing team's 20. Well, he didn't get the touchdown. If he stops there he hasn't finished it. You have to cross the goal line. And until I finish it I haven't crossed the goal line.
