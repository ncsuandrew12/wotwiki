#### Rochelle O'Gorman

Do you read much fantasy?

#### Robert Jordan

I read everything. At the moment I'm reading an Andrew Vachss novel. The book before that was called
*The Code Book*
, about the development of ciphers and codes. The book before that was called
*Strange Victory*
, about the defeat of France in 1940â€”something that I think should be required reading for every member of Congress and every single person in the Pentagon.

#### Rochelle O'Gorman

So you're an eclectic reader?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. Before that John Sanford and Patricia Cornwell and George Martin. I don't act as a tourist when I'm on (book) tour. I make my appearances, and in between time I put my feet up to rest them and I read.
