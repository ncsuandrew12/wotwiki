#### Brandon Sanderson

Finally, what's up with stuff? Well, I'm a little over a quarter of the way through the
*Warbreaker*
4.0 rewrite. It's going smoothly, and I'm feeling much less stressed now that I know it will be off the plate completely and done. I will have everything in order when I start
*A Memory of Light*
. That's good, because as a writer, I tend to get very focused. I like to work on one project at a time and put my all into it. I really don't like worrying about other projects while focused like that, and this way, I won't have any other obligations to publishers until next fall. Doing
*Warbreaker*
now may push my work on
*A Memory of Light*
back a few weeks, but it will mean that I can devote myself better to that book when the time comes, and that will make working on it go much more smoothly.
