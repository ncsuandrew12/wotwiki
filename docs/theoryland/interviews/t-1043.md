## Entry #1

#### PrncRny

What can you tell us about anagrams in what Wit says to Dalinar? Like how "Balderdash" is an anagram of "Shardblade"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Everything Wit says is significant. How much or how little varies, but it's all significant.

## Entry #2

#### PrncRny

I asked if we had met any other Rithmatists who gained any their abilities from some other method than the Inception ceremony besides Nalazar.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was a flat out no. "Unless you include what Hardy was doing."

## Entry #3

#### PrncRny's Wife

If using their abilities slowly drives them mad, how can good epics rise up to help?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is kind of the point of the novel isn't it

## Entry #4

#### PrncRny

Alcatraz follow-up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've had enough asking about it that I really should do the last one. It's back burner for now, but I want to.

## Entry #5

#### PrncRny

What are the plans for a Legion television series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The studios option on it expires here in December. If they renew it, they have another year to begin production. Nothing firm yet.
