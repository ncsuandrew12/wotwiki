# [Interview #567, Entry #3]: TOM Signing Report - Tower Guards](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=567#3)

#### Tower Guard

Questions for Brandon included which character he enjoys writing most vs. which he enjoys reading most.

#### Brandon Sanderson

For writing, he quoted Robert Jordan, saying that it tended to be whichever he was writing, though he admitted that it depended a lot upon the type of scene he was writing vs. the type of mood he was in. For reading, he said his favorite was Perrin earlier in the series, with Mat claiming the title later in the series. Brandon also spent several moments praising Harriet as an editor and a titan in the field, only breaking off when Harriet got so embarrassed that she made him stop.
