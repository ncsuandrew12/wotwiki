# [Interview #567: TOM Signing Report - Tower Guards, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=567#4)

#### Tower Guard

The highlight of the Q&A session had to be when Harriet was asked to pronounce the names of all the Forsaken.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet asked for a list, proclaiming “show me the wretched creatures!” A fan who had bought his Big White Book to be signed obliged eagerly. Harriet prefaced the reading by saying that this was HER interpretation of the names, but that any pronunciation the fans preferred was correct in her eyes. Discussion of the Forsaken continued on a bit, and Harriet pointed out that Robert Jordan used to say that all of his female characters had a bit of Harriet in them. To much laughter, she joked that Moghedien was the part of Harriet that would complain when Jordan forgot to take out the trash.
