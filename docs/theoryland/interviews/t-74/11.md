#### Question

Considering that schedule, do you spend every waking minute on your books or do you do other things in between that prepare you to write?

#### Robert Jordan

I do other things. I fish, although not nearly as often as I should, just for relaxation purposes, and of course I read. Actually, I have to read. If I don't read someone else before going to bed, I will lie there awake all night thinking about my own work and what I want to do next.
