#### Question

Any suggestions for authors/books to keep us busy while we wait for Book 8?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. Terry Pratchett, Ray Feist, C.S. Freidman, Barry Hughart, Robert Holdstock, Guy Gavriel Kay, and of course there's George R. R. Martin's new book. You ought to go back and read anything by John M. Ford that you can get your hands on.
