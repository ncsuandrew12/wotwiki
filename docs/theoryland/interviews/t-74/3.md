#### Question

I heard that some of your stuff is being republished.
*Fallon*
books, right?

#### Robert Jordan

That's correct. They are historical novels and I think they will appeal both to buffs of history novels, "The American Revolution," "The War Against the Tripoli Pirates," and also readers of what I have heard called "sober romances". The people are certainly full-blooded, shall we say, and there are a number of romances in there.

#### Question

About those historical novels, where do you get the information for those? Personal research?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, and a personal interest in history.
