#### Question

Did you get any inspiration from Arthurian legend?

#### Robert Jordan

Quite a bit, along with other Celtic myths and Norse myths and African and Middle-Eastern, and Hindu and Chinese and Japanese and Native American and even Australian Aboriginal. Plus some others here and there to tell you the truth.
