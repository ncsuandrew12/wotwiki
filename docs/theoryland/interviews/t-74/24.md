#### Question

Would you ever consent to a movie?

#### Robert Jordan

Sure! But who's going to make a movie at 16 or 18 hours per book? If anybody out there actually thinks he can cut one of these books down to a two hour movie, I suspect he's been drinking something funny!

#### Question

Well, there's always the option of a mini-series.

#### Footnote

At the time, full-season book adaptations were unheard of.
