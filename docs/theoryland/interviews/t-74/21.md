#### Question

Does RAFO mean you don't know how it will turn out, or do you want to keep us in suspense?

#### Robert Jordan

I want to keep you in suspense. If I give away all of the secrets, sooner or later you guys are going to start saying "Well I know all of this stuff. He's really gotten boring!"
