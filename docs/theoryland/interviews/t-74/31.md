#### Host

Robert, thank you so very much for taking your time to appear on AOL tonight. Any final comments for your audience?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes guys. Sorry if I was illiterate anywhere. I think I was in a few places. I am tired tonight. Good night everybody.

#### Host

And a special thanks to the audience for joining us. Have a good evening, folks. Until next time, AOL!

#### Footnote

He did misspell Tolkien. (In his defense, the questioner did also.)
