#### Question

How long did it take you to plan the Wheel of Time world?

#### Robert Jordan

A very long time. Almost ten years of thinking about it before I began writing. And then four years to write
*The Eye of the World*
. Then roughly 14 months each for the next five books, and about 20 or 21 months for
*A Crown of Swords*
. You see, I have the world planned out, but quite often details are a work in progress.
