#### Question

In your future WOT books will we start to see things from the Seanchan perspective?

#### Robert Jordan

It's quite possible, but the only real answer I can give is RAFO.

#### Question

To clarify...what is the RAFO reference to?

#### Robert Jordan

It's an acronym that some people who have been on the net have tossed at me in face to face meetings and I have tossed back at others and RAFO means READ AND FIND OUT.

#### Footnote

There were three
[Seanchan POVs](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=7139#poststop)
in
*The Shadow Rising*
: Suroth, Egeanin, and Almurat Mor (the Seeker investigating Egeanin). Sometimes 'RAFO' means 'read the books that are already published'.
