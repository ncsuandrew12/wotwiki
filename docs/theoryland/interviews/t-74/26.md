#### Question

Are you saying all the characters are based on various cultures around the world?

#### Robert Jordan

Bits and pieces sometimes. Not the characters, but the nations are sometimes based on bits and pieces of actual cultures and quite often it has nothing to do with any culture that I am aware of consciously.
