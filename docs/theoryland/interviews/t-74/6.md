#### Question

How do you feel about women being admitted to The Citadel?

#### Robert Jordan

In the first place, I do wish that the school had been able to remain all male, but the fact is, women are in The Citadel, and as far as I'm concerned, it's time to get on with the business at hand and stop grousing about what's past.
