#### Question

How much did Tolkien, or even Eddings' Belgariad chronicles influence the WOT series?

#### Robert Jordan

Eddings certainly not at all, and as for Tolkien, only to the degree that (1) he showed that it was possible to write a very large series of books, a very large story, and (2) the fact that I purposely did the first, oh, perhaps 80 pages of
*The Eye of the World*
as an homage to Tolkien in a way, that it was set in the same sort of pastoral country that Tolkien wrote about.
