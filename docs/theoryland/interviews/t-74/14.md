#### Question

Is Book 8 the end? If not, is there a plan for when the end will be?

#### Robert Jordan

Book 8 is not the end. There will be at least three more books and I am sorry for that. I have known what the last scene of the last book would be for quite a long time, 10 or 12 years at least. I just want to get to it without speeding up my pace.
