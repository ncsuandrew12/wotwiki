# [Interview #935: AMOL Signing Report - KiManiak, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=935#2)

#### KiManiak

I didn't write down specifics on anything that I hadn't heard discussed before in the reread or on Theoryland or that I didn't feel was new information. Here's a quick summary:

There were approximately 4 "process-type" questions;

There were 2 Mistborn questions and 1 Mistborn game question;

Harriet was asked a generic question about RJ;

There was one question that was RAFO'd (The Tuatha'an and the finding of the Song);

There was a question about Hoid and when he started appearing in Brandon's books (Brandon's 6th book,
*Elantris*
was listed as Hoid's first appearance; his next was in BWS's 7th book,
*Dragonsteel*
, then in his 8th book,
*White Sand*
);

Brandon recommended the works from authors Brian McClellan and Brent Weeks, and the novels
*A Fire Upon the Deep*
and
*The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms*
;

Harriet told the story of how she heard about and ultimately selected Brandon to continue RJ's work;

Finally, Harriet read the "Wind" passage from
*A Memory of Light*
.
