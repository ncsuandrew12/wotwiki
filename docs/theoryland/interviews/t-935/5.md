# [Interview #935: AMOL Signing Report - KiManiak, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=935#5)

#### KiManiak

While collared, would Moghedien be able to use her dreamwalking abilities to compel a
*sul'dam*
or someone else to release her from the collar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon answered (paraphrasing again) that that is not outside the realm of possibility.

#### Footnote

In 2013, Maria
[stated](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=749#18)
that there was nothing in the notes on this, but she believes one cannot touch
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
while collared.
