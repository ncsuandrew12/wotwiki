# [Interview #935: AMOL Signing Report - KiManiak, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=935#6)

#### KiManiak

I joked initially that I might get each of my questions RAFO'd; and Harriet and Brandon joked afterward that, see, I didnâ€™t get either of my questions RAFO'd, I did get
*some*
type of answer.

All in all, it was a good Saturday. I met some interesting folks and got turned on to a couple of other SFF series and bought 4 new books.

I strongly recommend that if you have the opportunity to attend a signing, that you go. And get there as early as possible, so you can get a good seat!
