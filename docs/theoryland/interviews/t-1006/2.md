# [Interview #1006, Entry #2]: TWOK Signing Report - HardcorePooka](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1006#2)

#### HardcorePooka

Also, while Brandon was signing my books and kindle I asked him a question. I asked if, as I know he is interested in webcomics and comics, if he would ever consider doing something along those lines with an artist.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He answered that he had been working on something but neither he nor the artist thought it was going in the right direction, but that yes, he would hopefully be doing something along those lines at some point.

#### HardcorePooka

This made me very happy.
