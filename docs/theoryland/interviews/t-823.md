## [Entry #1](./t-823/1)

#### Sei'taer

Here's what he told me, and I'm paraphrasing quite a bit.

#### Robert Jordan

In Eastern Europe they have a badger called a honey badger. It likes to break into honeybee hives and get the honey. People figured out that the badger would get stung so many times it would basically go into a coma for a little while and then wake up and start eating the honey. If you were lucky enough to be around when he went into his comatose state, then you could ease him out of the way and steal the honey for yourself.

#### Sei'taer

Now, how much of that is true, I couldn't tell you, but that's his explanation for the name. I wish I had gotten the chance to ask him about a nine horse hitch.
