# [Interview #439, Entry #3]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Release Parties, Giveaways, Annotations, and John Brown](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=439#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

John Brown joins the Writing Excuses team once again for
[this week's podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/10/04/)
, which deals with how to get over writing depression and how to evoke emotions in your readers. John's first book,
[*Servant of a Dark God*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765322358/?tag=monkeyslothst-20)
, comes out from Tor next week. I enjoyed the book and gave it a quote, which seems to have been chopped down to a single word. Anyway, you can read the first seven chapters
[on his website](http://johndbrown.com/novels/)
.
