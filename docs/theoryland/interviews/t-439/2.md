# [Interview #439: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Release Parties, Giveaways, Annotations, and John Brown, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=439#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the most recent annotations for
*Mistborn*
3, I discuss
[guns in fantasy](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/291)
and other perceived anachronisms. I also talk about
[Breeze and Sazed's relationship](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/292)
in the period since the end of
*Mistborn*
2. On many occasions I have details worked out that just don't end up in the book. Some of them go into the deleted scenes section of the
[Library](http://brandonsanderson.com/library)
, but many others end up in the annotations. If you're the type of fan who is always wondering what happens between the lines of my books, the
[annotations are for you](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation)
.
