# [Interview #1051: AMOL Signing Report - NutiketAiel, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1051#31)

MAJOR SPOILER for
*A Memory of Light*
in the next one. Be warned:

One fan asked Brandon about a particular incident in the epilogue of
*A Memory of Light*
, when Rand lit his pipe by thought.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon related that there were two kinds of notes that Robert Jordan had left—one set of notes to himself, to remind himself of various things, the other notes intended to help someone else complete the series. The epilogue, however, as has repeatedly been pointed out, did not need anyone to complete it—Robert Jordan had written it [
[almost](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#33)
] in its entirety. So, there was no explanation about how Rand accomplished this. Brandon did relate his own theory about the incident to the inquiring fan, however: "Certain people are touching the Pattern, and certain touches leave certain kind of marks."

#### NutiketAiel

For me, this was one of the highlights of the entire evening. The Great Brandon Sanderson himself, who has seen all of Robert Jordan’s notes and writings, and spent years working with Harriet and Team Jordan to complete the series… when it comes to this one thing, he has to come up with theories just like the rest of us fans. It made me feel really close to Brandon, in that moment.
