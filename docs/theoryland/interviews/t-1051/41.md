# [Interview #1051: AMOL Signing Report - NutiketAiel, Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1051#41)

#### NutiketAiel

One fan asked Brandon to rank Mat’s combat ability compared to other characters in the series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon described Mat as "good" and "above the curve." However, compared to Lan, Mat was "completely out-classed." Brandon confirmed that Lan is at the top in terms of combat ability, but added that, at his height, Tam was "pretty darn good" and could have taken Mat. However, Brandon cautioned that all this was not factoring Mat’s luck. Mat's combat abilities vary a great deal, depending on whether he was "ticked off," what the stakes of the battle were and whether he was in "awesome Mat mode."

Regarding the battles in the end of the series, Brandon said that some of the researchers working with them studied historical battles and fed him movements for authenticity.
