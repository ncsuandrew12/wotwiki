#### NutiketAiel

#### Brandon Sanderson

When asked about the Wheel of Time prequels, Brandon reiterated that there was about a "one billionth of one percent chance" of them ever being written. He said that the first prequel would have been about Tam going to war, and would have been in parallel with the story of Randâ€™s biological parents. The second would have been the further adventures of Moiraine and Lan, including their encounter with the Green Man.
