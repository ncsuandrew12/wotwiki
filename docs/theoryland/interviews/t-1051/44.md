# [Interview #1051, Entry #44]: AMOL Signing Report - NutiketAiel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1051#44)

#### NutiketAiel

So, that’s my report. I hope you all found it interesting and, perhaps, a little useful. It certainly gave me a lot to think about. I was thoroughly honored to have met Harriet, and so pleased to be able to see and speak to Brandon again. I hope I get the opportunity to take notes again at his next signing. You know, I started this report by lamenting the lack of an audio recording of the proceedings… but I think that taking and transcribing these notes was actually more fun for me. I guess I feel more… invested in the process this way? I don’t know. Either way, if I get the opportunity to do this again, I think I’ll do the same thing I did this time.

But maybe do some hand and wrist exercises first. Writer’s cramp!!
