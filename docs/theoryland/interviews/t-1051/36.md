#### NutiketAiel

When asked about his own contributions to the Wheel of Time, Brandon related a request he had made of Harriet.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I wanted an Asha'man of my ownâ€¦ Androl had been in the books, but there was no personality with him, just a name." "I took him wherever I wanted to go." He clarified that Androl was not an author surrogate, or a way of inserting himself into the books, but that he was a character that Brandon could develop and write as he pleased.
