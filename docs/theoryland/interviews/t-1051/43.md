# [Interview #1051: AMOL Signing Report - NutiketAiel, Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1051#43)

"If a native of Sel or another Shardworld travelled to Nalthis, would they be a drab?"

Brandon almost answered quickly, but then got a thoughtful look and paused to consider with a "hmm." After a moment, he replied:

#### Brandon Sanderson

"No, they would not be a drab. But, no one would be able to take their breath."

#### NutiketAiel

"If such a person died on Nalthis, could they Return?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"No, they cannot Return."

#### NutiketAiel

"If such a person received breath, could they use BioChroma?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Yes."

#### NutiketAiel

I was probably grinning like a looby at this point, but I didn't care. Brandon complimented me on my questions, saying that I had asked some good ones and that nobody had gotten so much information out of him in a while. I don't know whether he meant it, or was just trying to give me some confidence and make me feel good about myself as an amateur realmatic theorist (very, very amateur), but either way it made me feel like a million bucks.

Brandon’s good at that. I’m consistently amazed by his positive attitude, and just how much attention he lavishes on his fans.
