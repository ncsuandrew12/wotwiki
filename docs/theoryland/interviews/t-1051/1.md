# [Interview #1051: AMOL Signing Report - NutiketAiel, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1051#1)

Well, I was going through some things on my computer and found my old report from this signing. I never did hear back from Peter Ahlstrom after I emailed him, but he's a busy guy I'm sure. I figure, though, that after a year, I'm probably safe to post it. So, here is my report. Much of the information has already gotten out through other signings and sources, but some may still find it interesting, and I think at least one of the answers to my questions about Nalthis towards the end may still hold new information.

Also, upon re-reading it, I discovered that I sound like a shameless fanboy. Or maybe I am a shameless fanboy. Meh.
