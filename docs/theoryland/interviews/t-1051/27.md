One fan asked Brandon to compare Kaladin with Galad, Gawyn and Lan.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that Kaladin shares things with both [Gawyn and Lan]. Lan overcame his troubled past, whereas Kaladin hasn't yet. Brandon hopes that Kaladin does better than Gawyn, who was overcome by his past and let it crush him. In reference to all three, he said "I would hope that Kaladin would appreciate the comparison."
