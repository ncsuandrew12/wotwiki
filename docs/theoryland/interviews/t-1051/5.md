#### NutiketAiel

#### Brandon Sanderson

I heard a little girl and a little boy both separately ask about when Alcatraz 5 was coming out (a topic near and dear to my heart, too). Brandon explained that he had bought the rights to the series back as of January 1st, and said that it "might be the breather book after Second Stormlight."
