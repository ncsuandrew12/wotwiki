# [Interview #571: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In
*The Gathering Storm*
Brandon did tell us that Rand was mostly his voice and Egwene was RJ. In
*Towers of Midnight*
Mat was RJ and Perrin was more BS. I'm not quite sure what he meant by voice, considering he doesn't usually answer questions like this.
