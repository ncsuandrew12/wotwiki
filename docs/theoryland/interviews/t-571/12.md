#### Question

Why did Verin trust that Mat would open the letter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verin was bound to the Dark Oaths and she could not tell ANY of them to open the letters right away because she was not in her last hour. She had thought that out of anyone Mat would NOT listen to her and would open the letter right away. She was not able to give him any indication of what was in the letter or even tell him to open it open it right away.
