# [Interview #571: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#6)

#### Question

When the wolves were on Dragonmount, who were they there to “lend strength to”—Rand or Perrin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They were there for Rand. They were doing what they thought would help Rand. Keep in mind that they are wolves and are not thinking as men would when it comes to the idea of helping others.
