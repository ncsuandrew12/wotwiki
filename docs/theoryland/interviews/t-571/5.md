# [Interview #571, Entry #5]: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#5)

#### Question

Much has been made of Egwene’s thought to tie up Perrin in the midst of a battle that could have brought about his death if he had not been able to stop her. Such apparent negligence is shocking considering her knowledge of how quickly things can happen in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Can you explain Egwene’s thought process? Did she intend to leave Perrin there while she finished the battle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(not verbatim) Egwene thought she was doing the right thing. She was acting as the Amyrlin and trying to make sure that he would be safe and out of the way of danger. She was not going to tie him up and leave him, she would have brought him somewhere safe away from the danger of the fight and left him there until it was over.

#### ZAELA SEDAI

Who is stronger in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

(not verbatim) They are both very strong, but in different ways. Perrin is very strong instinctively. Like the wolves, he makes decisions based on instinct while in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Egwene plans out her moves rather than going by feeling as Perrin does. If the two were matched against each other the outcome would entirely be based on what type of encounter it was.
