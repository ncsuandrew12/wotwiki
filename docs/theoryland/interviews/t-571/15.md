# [Interview #571: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#15)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet was asked about religion in the series. Her response was that they are far more aware of the Light and Dark because it is what is around them, more so than it is for us. The Children of the Light are the closest thing to organized religion and it shows you what Robert Jordan feelings were towards organized religion.
