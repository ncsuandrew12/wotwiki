# [Interview #571, Entry #4]: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is still a chance that the prequels/outriggers would be done; Brandon wants to do them IF Harriet decides to have them written. Brandon would rather the prequels over the outriggers but TOR would rather the outriggers it seems as of right now, if only one is chosen (which probably would not be the case)
