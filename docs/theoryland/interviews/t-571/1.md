# [Interview #571: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#1)

#### Zaela Sedai

Here is the unofficial report from the signing. AKA what I could make of my notes. We will have an official report later with the video and such. I was taking pictures, so I wrote as much as I could when I could. We had a great time; there were a ton of people there (about 200) we only had about 45 minutes of alone time with Brandon, so I had to share. But hopefully you guys enjoy some of the info I got!
