# [Interview #571: TOM Signing Report - Zaela Sedai, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#13)

#### Question

Have we met the “ugly man”? (I assume Gaidal; this was a question I heard during the signing.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes we have.

#### Footnote

Fans have determined that this is actually impossible, since none of the babies seen on screen qualify (based on RJ's very strict guidelines).
