#### Chaos

You know how sometimes, news stations will say "late-breaking" to say that a story is happening right at that moment?

This is not one of those.

Needless to say this is a very late report of, let's say, "an event". I got the opportunity to ask Brandon some questions, so I did. I wasn't able to transcribe Brandon's exact answers, but the second I could, I wrote the notes of the facts that I learned. Some of these answers are things you guys have learned since then.

So this is the transcription of the notes that I made after this event, along with my comments trying to remember why the crap I wrote the crap that I did. Here goes.

## [Entry #2](./t-1011/2)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Inquisitors knowing how to Compound: some may have figured it out at some point. I got the impression it was not a technique the Lord Ruler taught them.

## [Entry #3](./t-1011/3)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Shards and Shard intents: Holding a Shard is a contest of willpower against the Shard that, over time, is very hard to resist.

Shards affect you over time, but your mind will not leave a permanent effect on the Shard. A holder's personality, however, does get to filter the Shard's intent, so to speak. However, if that holder no longer held that Shard, the Shard will not continue to be filtered by that person.

## [Entry #4](./t-1011/4)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Sazed's two Shards do not "cancel out", as Brandon said that it would like being pulled by two huge gravitational tides. You can get to a way that you aren't instantly ripped apart, but that doesn't mean you don't feel it. EDIT: When asked what effect the Shards would have on Sazed, Brandon said, "Read Alloy of Law to find out".

## [Entry #5](./t-1011/5)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Sazed is a Shard. Just like a king of two countries is still a king, a holder of two Shards is a Shard.

## [Entry #6](./t-1011/6)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

I don't remember what prompted me to write this, or what impression I had that made me write this, but I wrote:
**Anyone can take up a Shard.**
No ifs, ands, or buts about it. I would not have written this if it was not crystal clear to me that this is what Brandon meant.

## [Entry #7](./t-1011/7)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Odium wants to be the
*only*
Shard. Odium could pick up other Shards if he wants to, but, he doesn't want to. His Shard is a good match for his personality and he doesn't want to be influenced by another Shard.

## [Entry #8](./t-1011/8)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Brandon said offhandedly, "It is not random who got which Shard." Also, Shards
*very*
rarely change hands. Brandon emphasized the "very" there.

## [Entry #9](./t-1011/9)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Seons are remnants of a dead Shard.

## [Entry #10](./t-1011/10)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

We asked some questions about the Lord Ruler, like if he knew about chromium and nicrosil. Brandon said he knew about those metals, and then also said "The Lord Ruler knew a lot of things that no one knows." All right then.

## [Entry #11](./t-1011/11)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

I continued to ask about the Lord Ruler and his Allomantic strength. There's an upper bound to the amount of power you can get from being a savant. Brandon said that, obviously, the Lord Ruler wasn't using duralumin and Elend could only get that powerful in Soothing using duralumin. He implied that there was a way to Compound to enhance Allomancy. (Note, we have discussed this on the forums a while back. This isn't news.)

## [Entry #12](./t-1011/12)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

We asked if it was possible to use bronze to Seek Feruchemy. He said it could be possible. If it were to happen, it was very hard, because the Inquisitors would desperately like to be able to find Feruchemists that way, and it was implied they had not discovered this power. So, it is a freaking hard technique to learn, if possible at all.

## [Entry #13](./t-1011/13)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

If you are Smoked, you can't Seek.

## [Entry #14](./t-1011/14)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Ketchup does not exist in the Final Empire, since it is from a fruit, which are flowering plants. The Lord Ruler did not engineer fruit. Mostly people eat vegetables and roots.

#### Footnote

Oddly, there are references to fruit in Mistborn: The Final Empire. It is not known if this is merely a case of early-installment weirdness, or something else.

## [Entry #15](./t-1011/15)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

For people really into the obscure workings of the politics of the Final Empire, we asked about the legality of assassinations. It turns out that you have to ask the obligators' permission to assassinate someone--and permission, of course, means bribe in this context. The Steel Ministry can say yes or no. Presumably more high level people would cost more money to be killed. Of course, if the Ministry says no, you can always risk it and assassinate illegally, but you'd have to be very careful not to get caught. Even with legal killings you need to keep things quiet. Brandon said the Steel Ministry has much more corruption than governments in our world. Corruption which we would abhor is commonplace in the Final Empire.

## [Entry #16](./t-1011/16)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Lerasium overwrites Spiritual DNA. It can do some interesting things, and can overwrite your Spiritual DNA in different ways if you do it right. If a Surgebinder ate lerasium, he would become an Allomancer, but Brandon implied other things could be done.

## [Entry #17](./t-1011/17)

#### Chaos

Some other things that I had overheard and noted:

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Shardblades can be willed down. We see this with Dalinar slamming the Shardblade down into the stone at the end of the Way of Kings.

## [Entry #18](./t-1011/18)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

What happens to Seons during the Reod is that the Reod messes with the Seon's spirit.

## [Entry #19](./t-1011/19)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

The Shaod is an effect of Elantris.

## [Entry #20](./t-1011/20)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Allomantic pewter strength can be stored in a metalmind, but it's probably easier to just Compound.

## [Entry #21](./t-1011/21)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

Feruchemy is about multipliers. The more the Lord Ruler aged, the less "multiplier" he could store in his metalmind. And the more he aged the more he would need to Compound to stay alive. There could exist an upper bound to the amount of time the Lord Ruler could survive off this trick.

## [Entry #22](./t-1011/22)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

At one point, the Lord Ruler tried to quit and end the Final Empire.

## [Entry #23](./t-1011/23)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

There is a way to get a non-powered person to access a metalmind. (Presumably now, with the Mistborn RPG, we know that this may have something to do with Identity.)

## [Entry #24](./t-1011/24)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

One does not have to kill someone with Hemalurgy to charge a spike, but it rips off a large part of the soul. The person would not be the same.

## [Entry #25](./t-1011/25)

#### BRANDON SANDERSON (paraphrased)

As it turns out, there is an error in the Feruchemical table when Brandon put it in Mistborn 2. If you look closely, Determination (insert metal) doesn't belong in its group. The group that it is in is obviously more physical powers. Determination was supposed to be a mental metal, and Warmth was supposed to be in that Physical group. He just made a mistake originally. But it turns out that Feruchemy obeys different rules than Allomancy, so Brandon isn't retconning it, but saying that Feruchemy works differently now. Apparently there was going to be a table of Feruchemy at the end of Alloy of Law, but it wasn't ready because Isaac kept thinking like an Allomancer. Feruchemy has its own rules (for example, Brandon confirmed that pewter does steal Feruchemical health, probably because that second group of physical Feruchemical powers are also "physical", so pewter can steal them.) Hemalurgy also obeys different rules.

#### Footnote

The metal for determination is electrum

## [Entry #26](./t-1011/26)

#### Chaos

Yes, so, this happened at Alloy. There's no excuse for this level of lateness. Don't kill me. Meep.
