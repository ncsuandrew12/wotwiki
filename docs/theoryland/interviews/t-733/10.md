# [Interview #733: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=733#10)

#### Tahir Velimeev

In recent years, computer games that are based on literary works (including fantasy/science fiction) have become very popular. For example, "World-ring" by Larry Niven, "Shannara" by Terry Brooks ... Have the creators of virtual worlds turned their attention to creating something from the Wheel of Time universe?

#### Robert Jordan

As far as I know, not so long ago a Wheel of Time role-playing game was released by Legend Entertainment. My friend, writer John M. Ford, acquainted me with its creators. Incidentally, he facilitated the appearance of a desktop-type card game similar to Magic issued by the company Precedence.
