# [Interview #733, Entry #14]: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - Interview with Robert Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=733#14)

#### Tahir Velimeev

James, I noticed that you have a love for hats. Is there some special reason? Or is it something like a rabbit's foot, a talisman for good luck?

#### Robert Jordan

No, the reason is simple. Once I put on a hat and my wife noticed that the hat worked well for me. I have worn them ever since. I like it.

#### Tahir Velimeev

All of your nine Wheel of Time books have a dedication—they are dedicated to Harriet ...

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, to my wife, Harriet McDougal, the light of my life. Like me, she has a connection to the Navy—her father was an admiral, and as far as literature, fantasy—she worked about thirteen years as an editor at the publishing house TOR. Then she became my first and most faithful reader and the first editor of my books. I am very grateful to her for help and support. By the way, Sergei Berezhnoi told me that you Takhir, took part in the translation of the entire Wheel of Time in Russian! So you can be called in some way my co-author! I am truly glad! Let me shake your hand.

#### Tahir Velimeev

Thank you, James! We will wait for your new books.
