# [Interview #733: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=733#2)

#### Tahir Velimeev

I am very glad to meet you, dear Mr. Jordan! Welcome to St. Petersburg.

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you! I'm also glad for the chance to visit your beautiful city. I’ve been to not a few places, but this is my first time in Russia. Many thanks to the organizers of the Wanderer Fantasy Convention who invited me to St. Petersburg. And my special thanks to them for the opportunity to visit Peterhof and admire its magnificent fountains. Fountains have fascinated me since childhood ...

#### Tahir Velimeev

What is the proper way to address you?—Mr. Robert Jordan? Or Mr. James Rigney ... Or in some other way?

#### Robert Jordan

Call me, as we do it in America, just James.

#### Tahir Velimeev

Or Robert? ...

#### Robert Jordan

Robert is fine too. I'm used to it. I’m often addressed exactly so in meetings with readers.

#### Tahir Velimeev

By the way, how many names does the multifaceted James Oliver Rigney, Jr. have?

#### Robert Jordan

Not very many, but also not a few. Under the pseudonym Reagan O'Neal the historical novels
*The Fallon Blood*
,
*The Fallon Legacy*
and
*The Fallon Pride*
were published. The events in them takes place during the American Revolution, around my hometown of Charleston. The name Jackson O'Reilly is on the cover of the western Cheyenne Raiders. My critical pieces on theater and dance I signed Chang Lung. And under the pseudonym Robert Jordan the novels of the Conan series and the The Wheel of Time series were published.
