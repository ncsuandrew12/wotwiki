# [Interview #733: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=733#12)

#### Tahir Velimeev

James, in recent years, many writers have created their own sites on the Internet, for example, your colleague, Alan Foster and Lois McMaster Bujold. But, try as I might I could not find your site, though I found many fan sites dedicated to The Wheel of Time.

#### Robert Jordan

I donâ€™t have my own website! On the one hand, as you rightly pointed out, there are many fan sites, and some of them are very good. They come across just wonderfully! On the other hand, making a site is easy. However, if I had to constantly spend time maintaining it, answer e-mails ... It would take a lot of time! I would rather spend this time writing something.
