# [Interview #733, Entry #11]: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - Interview with Robert Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=733#11)

#### Tahir Velimeev

And how are things going with film producers? Have they brought up the acquisition of rights for a film adaptation?

#### Robert Jordan

Several times interest in the possibility of adapting my books for film has come up. One television station even wanted to buy the rights to create the series, but I, frankly, took to their proposal with a fair amount of skepticism. Because the book is full of events, the series could get very long ... Basically all of these proposals have been the same and might as well be smoke in the wind. More likely there will be an animated film as by a Japanese studio. We will have to wait and see.
