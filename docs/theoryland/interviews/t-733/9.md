#### Tahir Velimeev

James, the artwork for
*The Eye of the World*
,
*The Great Hunt*
, and all the other books of the series that came out in the West were created by the artist Darrell Sweet. Have you seen the illustrations for your books published in Russia?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, your Russian publisher, Nick Naumenko, has been crucial and regularly sends me the translated publications printed in Russia. I really liked how it was put together and the work on the covers and interior illustrations. I met with Yana Ashmarin, one of the artists and we got to know each other and talked with great pleasure.
