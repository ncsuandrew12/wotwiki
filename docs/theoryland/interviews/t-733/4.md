# [Interview #733: Wanderer Fantasy Convention - Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=733#4)

#### Tahir Velimeev

And as far as I know, the two tours [in the Army] were fighting in Vietnam. In what capacity?

#### Robert Jordan

I flew in a helicopter as a gunner. Then I was a Sergeant and trained recruits.

#### Tahir Velimeev

On sorties, it most likely became necessary to shoot?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes ... But understand, on assignment you usually do not see people—you open fire as soon as you notice any movement, and do not think about it being a person. Otherwise, it is impossible—this is war, and the morals of a military person are other than those of a civilian: for a Commander the main thing is to perform his mission and save his soldiers. Reflection in the middle of a fight is dangerous—you will be killed before long.

#### Tahir Velimeev

Were you ever wounded?

#### Robert Jordan

Fortunately, no. A couple of times hurt ... Once, during a hard landing I knocked out teeth on the back of the pilot's seat in front of me. And another time a tiny splinter hit me in the eye. At first I didn’t notice anything and felt no pain, but then the blood flowed. Then the piece was drawn out with a magnet ...

#### Tahir Velimeev

Thus, the "Purple Heart" among your military decorations, right?

#### Robert Jordan

No—don’t even suggest such a thing! But there is a Distinguished Flying Cross for service, Bronze Star, and two Vietnamese Crosses for bravery.

#### Tahir Velimeev

Yeah, the bouquet\* on a blazer really makes an impression ...

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you.
