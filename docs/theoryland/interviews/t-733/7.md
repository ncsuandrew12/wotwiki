#### Tahir Velimeev

Of course, one of the most frequently asked questions—how will the saga end? And by the way, does the author himself know what the finale of this incredible fantasy saga will be?

#### Robert Jordan

How it will all end, I have known this for fifteen years—from the moment I started writing the first book,
*The Eye of the World*
. But I will not reveal any intrigue and tell you everything in advance. Why would I? Read and find out for yourself!
