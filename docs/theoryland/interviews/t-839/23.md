#### SATSUONI

Hello, Brandon! Thank you for doing this.
Here are my questions (all serious):
1. Is it possible to give cats intelligence with Hemalurgy? Or transfer cat's identity to a human?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

1: Hemalurgy can do some very, very odd things. And the endowment of intelligence is a common result of tinkering with shard-based magic.
