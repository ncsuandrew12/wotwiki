# [Interview #839, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=839#9)

#### KCHAN

Hey Brandon! It's Kerry. Thank you so much for doing this! I have a rather random-looking assortment of questions for you:

How does Snapping work after Sazed changed it? If you donâ€™t want to reveal it all right now, are there any hints you can give us?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

He couldn't get rid of this entirely. I don't want to spoil things, but Snapping was built into Allomancy primarily because of larger-scale magical issues. This is getting deep into the issue, but it has to do with a person's spiritual makeup and a 'wounded' spirit being easier to fill with something else, kind of like a cut would let something into the bloodstream. Sazed made this threshold on Scadrial much easier to obtain.
