#### WINDRUNNER

Is the Dor made up of both Devotion and Dominionâ€™s power?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

The Dor's nature, and why it acts as it does, is in part related to this question.

#### WINDRUNNER

Also the TWoK nerd in me is totally embarrassed that I didn't ask any questions on that.(It was the first of your books I read, and my favorite) I can't wait for Stormlight 2 though, and will hopefully be at the release!

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Thanks!
