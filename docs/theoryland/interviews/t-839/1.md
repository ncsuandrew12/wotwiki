# [Interview #839, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=839#1)

#### EMERALIS00

not serious questions.\*
Have you seen or heard of the anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica?
Is Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, or Twilight BEST PONY?

\*It isn't really neccessary to answer these, but I want to know. As for the others, who I know want to downvote this post so bad. Deal with it. I can ask the questions I want.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I have heard of Madoka Magica, but have not watched it. I don't know the other one. I haven't really gotten into an anime since Bebop, though people keep telling me I need to watch one of the Full Metal Alchemist shows.

Well, my son (having only girl cousins) has a stuffed rabbit he named Fluttershy...so that one? I'm afraid you're talking to the wrong Dragonsteel person for MLP discussion. Peter's a fan, but I've never actually seen an episode of the new incarnation. (My little sisters, many years ago, did make me suffer through the movie with the sea ponies about a billion times, however.)
