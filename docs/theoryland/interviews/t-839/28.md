#### THOUGHTFUL SPURTS

Hi Mr. Sanderson.
Thank you for doing this, you're awesome . My questions:
1.) Are there any racist jokes in the Mistborn world?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes, I would think there are lots of racist jokes everywhere. It's more of a thing on Roshar, however, where the races are more distinct and rub each other the wrong way more often.
