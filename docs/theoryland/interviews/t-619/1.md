Post #1 of WorldCon 2011 at Reno: Brandon Sanderson's Reading

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon read part of a new novella exploring superpowers. I liked it a lot. There are no super heroes, only super villains, and they take over world. The chapter he read describes two such and how a boy is the only surviving witness to the wounding of one of these supposedly invincible super-powered human. Ten years after the events Sanderson narrated, the protagonist tries to find a group of humans who research the individual weaknesses of the “Epics” and assassinate them.

Sanderson's idea is of normal people trying to take down someone with superpowers, a reversal of the powerful guy protecting the humble.
