#### Brandon Sanderson

To keep the voice straight, he writes new material in one book at a time, but will revise another series alongside it. He does a lot of re-drafts and revision, especially adding description and writes every day for at least 8 hours. Being a full-time writer is a great opportunity, he believes, and he doesn't want to waste it.
