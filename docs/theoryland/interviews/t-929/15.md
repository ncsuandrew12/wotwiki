# [Interview #929: AMOL Signing Report - DJ Stipe, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=929#15)

#### Question

An entire writer's group (besides Jason Denzel's group, who were also there) came through the line and talked to Brandon together.

When he found out they were an unpublished writing group he told the story about how, shortly after having books published, he was at a friend of a friend's house and was introduced as a writer to the host. The host responded, "So you're unemployed." Brandon was excited to be able to tell him "No, I actually get paid for it now." He is very supportive of aspiring writers (if you don't know about it, check out his weekly writing podcast here:

).
