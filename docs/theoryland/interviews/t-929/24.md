#### Question

Was the Last Battle chapter in
*A Memory of Light*
190 pages long because that was how Jordan wanted it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, Brandon made this decision himself because he felt like none of the characters could put their weapons down during this stretch, so he wanted the reader to be in the same predicament and not be able to put the book down.
