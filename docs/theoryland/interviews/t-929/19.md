# [Interview #929: AMOL Signing Report - DJ Stipe, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=929#19)

#### DJ Stipe

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Bela's death was the runaway winner for most brought up subject, to which Brandon usually arched his arm across the head of Memory Keeper Aviendha, pointed at Harriet and said, "Blame her." At one point he said he wrote a scene where she fought back to life, but Harriet cut it. She overheard this, said it wasn't true and Brandon responded that he'd wanted to. He then said that he likes to think that when the Horn is called next one of the Heroes will be riding a shaggy, gray mare.
