# [Interview #929: AMOL Signing Report - DJ Stipe, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=929#8)

#### Question

The Dark One seems to be conscious and aware of the events in the world. Is the Creator also conscious of world events?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that's left up to the reader. He then said that many people think the voice in all caps in
*The Eye of the World*
is the Creator, which might indicate the Creator was, but stated it really wasn't known even in-world.
