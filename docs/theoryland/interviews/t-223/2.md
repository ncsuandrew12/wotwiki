# [Interview #223: KOD Signing Report - Jeff Bumgardner, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=223#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Anyway, when he signed my books I just asked him what he thought of the Darrell K. Sweet covers, and he said they were okay, but that he has minimal input on them. Sometimes he suggests scenes, and when he gets to look at the paintings prior to publication he suggest changes, but in the end basically Tor does whatever they want with it.

A friend of mine ahead of me in line asked RJ if he would ever do any more Conan books and he said no, he only did them because he needed the money at the time. Obviously, he doesn’t need money anymore. ;^)

So that’s it. Nothing too exciting. At least I got to finally meet him after so long.
