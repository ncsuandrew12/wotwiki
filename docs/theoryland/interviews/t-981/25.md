# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#25)

#### Terez

What happened to the Black Ajah that were with Rand after the Purge? Was that another thing that got overlooked? Because I know there was at least one—Fera—besides Elza, who obviously got blasted.

#### Maria Simons

I don't know.

#### Terez

(later in email she told me that she had answered this for someone else, with time to think about it.)

#### Maria Simons

I believe that any Black Ajah
*da'tsang*
got the Black Ajah signal that the jig was up, and scarpered. I don't know anything else.
