# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#29)

#### Terez

Will there be anything more about the Land of Madmen in the Encyclopedia, or is the Guide all we get?

#### Maria Simons

To the best of my knowledge, the Guide is all you get. There might be a sentence more somewhere, but not extensive information.
