# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#26)

#### Terez

Min predicted a tempestuous love affair for Sarene, and a lot of people said after the book that was a mistake, because it wasn't mentioned, and I was like, "Her Warder, Vitalien..." because she wrote poetry comparing him to a leopard. (laughter)

#### Maria Simons

Yeah. There's a line somewhere about, she was always incredibly calm except when her Warder was around, or something like that...

#### Terez

Some people thought that it referred to Graendal...(laughter) And I'm like, "No....that doesn't count."

#### Maria Simons

Yeah....no....

#### Terez

You know, Compulsion, tempestuous love affair, same thing...
