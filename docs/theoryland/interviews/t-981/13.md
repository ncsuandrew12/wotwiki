# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#13)

#### Terez

Why are some of the heroes of the Horn referred to by the name of their last incarnation, while others seem to have archetypal names...like Birgitte, who I think has lived more recently than Birgitte. I might be wrong about that though, because we don't really have the details on that.

#### Maria Simons

I have no clue.
