# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#17)

#### Terez

Rosara Medrano appears in the Sun Palace at the beginning of
*Crossroads*
and seems to be an Aes Sedai. Was she part of the White Tower Embassy or did she arrive with Cadsuane?

#### Maria Simons

I'm almost positive she was with Cadsuane, with Cadsuane's faction. I think I asked Jim that when we were actually working on the book.
