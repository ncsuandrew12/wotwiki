#### Terez

Rosara Medrano appears in the Sun Palace at the beginning of
*Crossroads*
and seems to be an Aes Sedai. Was she part of the White Tower Embassy or did she arrive with Cadsuane?

#### Maria Simons

I'm almost positive she was with Cadsuane, with Cadsuane's faction. I think I asked Jim that when we were actually working on the book.
