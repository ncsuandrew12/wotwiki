# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#1)

The (transcription of the)
*Memory of Light*
panel is still forthcoming, and the report on our meeting with Brandon, but for now here is a Q&A I did with Maria mostly based on some questions sent to me by my friend Colin. I was expecting she wouldn't know the answers to many of them, but I was hoping for some tidbits, and I got some. Even some of the "I don't know" answers are interesting. If sometimes it seems like I'm talking too much when I should be waiting for an answer, keep in mind sometimes I cut out the whole \*pause\* \*Maria face\* \*tries to be helpful\* sequence.
