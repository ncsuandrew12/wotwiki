# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#10)

#### Terez

Who had Herid Fel killed?

#### Maria Simons

That was
*A Crown of Swords*
right?

#### Terez

It was in the epilogue of
*Lord of Chaos*
. They found out about it in
*A Crown of Swords*
. And it was the
*gholam*
. So it had to beâ€”

#### Maria Simons

Sammael, yeah. That was Sammael.

#### Terez

Do you know the reason?

#### Maria Simons

Because he somehow learned that Fel was helping Rand and didn't want the information...?

#### Terez

A friend of mine has a theory; he believed that Herid Fel was Asmodean in disguise, because he didn't believe Asmodean was dead.

#### Maria Simons

That's a good theory! I like that theory.

#### Terez

I like it too! Because it would explain a lot... (including why a
*gholam*
was sent to kill a non-channeler)

#### Maria Simons

Yeah.
