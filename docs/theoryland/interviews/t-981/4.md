# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#4)

#### Terez

The thick black cord that was attached to Ishamael at the Eye of the World (technically it was at Shayol Ghul or in Dreamland) that Rand saw...is that different from the black wires?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know.

#### Terez

I
[asked](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#30)
Brandon about that one too.

#### Maria Simons

I would have to really look at it and check the notes; it's not something that I know right off the top....

#### Terez

It's described a little bit differently. I thought maybe one was a connection to the True Power, and the other was protection from the taint, but RJ
[couldn't](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#14)
[decide](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#11)
if that was the same thing or not.

#### Maria Simons

I recently saw something about that in the notes, but I'm not remembering exactly what it said.

#### Terez

Do you happen to know anything about Ishamael's plan with the Eye, because it seems like he was trying to lead them there; why did he keep mentioning the Eye? Did he have a dream about it or something? You don't know?

#### Maria Simons

No.
