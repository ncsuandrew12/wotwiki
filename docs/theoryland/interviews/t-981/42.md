# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#42)

#### Terez

Lanfear's dream palace, with all the white hangings...was that a dream place, or a real place?

#### Maria Simons

I don't remember that.

#### Terez

Yeah, I think we only see it when she opens a gateway. And we saw it that once when she cut off that dude's head with her gateway in
*Winter's Heart*
. (Actually, we didn't see it there; I remembered it wrong.)

#### Maria Simons

Oh, right. I don't know; I would have to look at that one, and I might figure it out.
