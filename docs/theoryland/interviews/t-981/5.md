# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#5)

#### Terez

RJ
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=240#4)
that Fain was responsible for the fly trap thing; it's in
*The Great Hunt*
, in that little village...

#### Maria Simons

He did?

#### Terez

Yeah. Because a lot of people thought it was Lanfear, and RJ said it was Fain.

#### Maria Simons

\*looks surprised\*

#### Terez

So I guess you don't know the answer to that question. (repeats self) ...and that kind of blew everyone's theories out of the water...

#### Maria Simons

Yeah, because I thought it was Lanfear.

#### Footnote

It's possible Maria is right that it's Lanfear; we only have paraphrased reports of RJ saying it was Fain: two reports from the same signing in 2005 that might actually be written by the same person.
