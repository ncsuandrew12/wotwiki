#### Terez

Does the Horn work whenever it's blown, or are specific circumstances required?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know that one either. Because I answered that for somebody; I think it was
[one of Luckers' questions](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#8)
way back...it was a different version of the question, you know, was the banner really required?

#### Terez

So why is the Horn of Valere linked to Illian?

#### Maria Simons

That's another good question that I don't have the answer to.
