# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#18)

So,
*sul'dam*
usually have to tell the
*damane*
what to do, but Tuon doesn't have to do that when we see her in
*Knife of Dreams*
...is that a matter of Talent, skill...something else? So it's like, you know, after they work with the Power for a while, they can see the weaves, right? Is it kind of along the same lines? After a while you don't actually have to tell the
*damane*
what to do; you can do it yourself through the
*damane*
?

#### Maria Simons

That would be my assumption. I don't know it positively.
