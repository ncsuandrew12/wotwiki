# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#9)

#### Terez

In
*The Dragon Reborn*
, Perrin sees Ishamael, Rahvin, and Be'lal in a place that looks like the Ways—and of course we see that place in
*The Eye of the World*
, in the boys' dreams too—is that a construct that Ishamael makes in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
?

#### Maria Simons

I am assuming so, but again, I don't know.

#### Terez

I got the impression (because of
[this conversation](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#24)
) that Brandon kinda tried to explain that one.
