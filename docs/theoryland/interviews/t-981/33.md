# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#33)

#### Terez

Was Merilille with Talaan?

#### Maria Simons

We don't know.

#### Footnote

Most fans seem to believe that Brandon just put Talaan in
*A Memory of Light*
because a lot of fans were asking about her; RJ probably didn't leave any notes about where she and Merilille went.
