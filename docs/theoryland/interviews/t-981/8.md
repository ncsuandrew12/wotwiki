# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#8)

#### Terez

How did Moiraine identify Sammael and Be'lal? How did she know their names?

#### Maria Simons

I'm assuming research; I don't know.

#### Terez

My theory was always eavesdropping.

#### Maria Simons

Oh yeah, that's another good possibility.

#### Terez

And that would be a reason why she tipped Sammael off to her presence.

#### Maria Simons

Yeah.

#### Terez

How did she rediscover balefire? Assuming research again?

#### Maria Simons

Assuming.

#### Marie Curie

That question always comes up, about whether you can learn a weave by reading about it.

#### Maria Simons

Yeah, I think it can help, and then you have to experiment and hope for the best.

#### Footnote
