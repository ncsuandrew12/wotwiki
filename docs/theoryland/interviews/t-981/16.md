# [Interview #981: JordanCon 2013 - Q&A with Maria, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=981#16)

#### Terez

Who gave Slayer the orders to kill Rand in Far Madding? And do you know who sent him to the Two Rivers?

#### Maria Simons

I think I know who sent Slayer to Far Madding.

#### Terez

I always thought it was Taim...

#### Maria Simons

Yeah...

#### Terez

Because why else would he disguise himself?

#### Maria Simons

Yeah. That one I know.

#### Terez

Yay!

#### Maria Simons

Yay!

#### Footnote

At this time the no-kill order had been temporarily lifted in an attempt to prevent the Cleansing, so there was no reason for the Forsaken to order Slayer in secrecy.
