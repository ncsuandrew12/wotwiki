# [Interview #793: TGS Signing Report - Lauren, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=793#1)

#### Lauren

I was at the Clayton, CA signing today and I asked Brandon if he had noticed the important thing in books 4-6 before he started writing WOT.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said no, but he also said that he had never really wondered about Asmodean either until he read about it online. He said that there are other people who are much better at ferreting things out than he is.
