#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, so on the trainride, there was talk of the prologues, Brandon said that in each of the prologues for the last three books there is one section that was fully written by RJâ€”in
*The Gathering Storm*
it was the farmer scene and in
*Towers of Midnight*
it was the Borderlanders' scene.

He said that the prologue will most probably be released ahead of time again (no big surprise there) and ideally he'd like for people to be able to buy the prologue and then get that much discount on the actual book, however that's difficult to manage with laws and regulations and such.
