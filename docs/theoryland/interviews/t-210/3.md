# [Interview #210: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER POST, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=210#3)

#### Robert Jordan

Now then. Isabel. Does your mother know you're posting at 1 AM? Do I need to ask her to supervise your online activities? Well, I suppose it might be 1 AM Eastern time, or Pacific. And you are in the Netherlands. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. And thank you for the spirited defense. I probably won't answer plot-related questions, but who knows. I might slip up and do one now and then.
