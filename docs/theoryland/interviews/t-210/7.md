# [Interview #210: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER POST, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=210#7)

#### Robert Jordan

For JBunG, I will definitely be spending a lot more time writing than on the blog. Now, I put in an hour now and again on the blog, every few days. When I go on tour, the blog will go silent for a while. And when I come back and go to full work days on Book 12, I'll probably post no more than once a week unless I have something I think really needs to be said.
