# [Interview #210: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER POST, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=210#5)

#### Robert Jordan

For Cloverleaf, my next set of books after The Wheel of Time will also be fantasy, entitled Infinity of Heaven. The writing style will remain the same, though I will keep trying, as I always have, to get better. There are no plans to publish a collection of my raw notes, but Harriet, with my incidental help, will be doing an Encyclopedia of WoT which will have a lot of stuff out of the notes.
