# [Interview #210: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER POST, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=210#9)

#### Robert Jordan

Well, enough of that. Some of you are probably getting afraid that I intend to post daily screeds by this time. I have a list of questions to answer already, and I'll try to get to the rest of them, and any others that pop up, before I go on tour.

Take care, guys.

All my best,
  
RJ
