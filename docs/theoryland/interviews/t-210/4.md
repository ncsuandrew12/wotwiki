# [Interview #210: Robert Jordan's Blog: YET ANOTHER POST, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=210#4)

#### Robert Jordan

For Rohit and Mand680, Robert Jordan doesn't come out of Hemingway. In fact, when I first made the connection, I had already written three books under the name. My pen names have all been chosen from three lists of names using my real initials. It has been a matter of one from column A and one from column B, or maybe column C. One pen name actually managed to contain all three initials in a first name and a surname.
