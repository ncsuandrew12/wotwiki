# [Interview #574: TOM Tower Guard Report - Sarayne, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=574#4)

#### Sarayne

In addition to the official Q & A session, many fans asked questions as they approached the table to get their books signed. We have documented those questions and answers also, and they can be found with the others. (Warning: These may contain slight spoilers for
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
). Some of the questions were fun, while others serious. All of them were given worthy answers!

While not everyone had a question for Brandon (at least one that wouldn't get R.A.F.O.'d), I think almost every person thanked him for continuing the series and let him know what a wonderful job he has done. One group of fans even brought Team Jordan a cake!

Lurking near the table to write down the questions people asked, we also heard many stories and comments, of course. One fan showed up with a European version of the book. He had traded with a European friend so they could get a taste of the different versions. Another fan noted that he had come all the way from Brazil! The signing wasn't his only purpose in the States, of course, but that is still quite a trip. A young woman came bearing
*Warbreaker*
and explained that it was purchased on her honeymoon, and when she got home she realized it was the only souvenir she had gotten. We heard a lot of compliments on all of Brandon’s work—especially
*The Way of Kings*
. Everyone who has read it seems to love it!

Several people let Brandon know how much they love and appreciate his Twitter updates, and of course there were a few fans that showed their appreciation by presenting him with Magic: The Gathering cards! In an interesting twist, he had his fans sign the cards they gave him so he will be able to remember where he got them! Among the books to be signed was someone's Kindle! That's right, Brandon & Harriet signed someone's Kindle. Starr Goozee, another fan, gave Brandon some gorgeous environmental photos she had taken. They really were magnificent, and you can see photos of them here. Emily Sanderson, Brandon's wife, sat beside him during part of the signing, and a bunch of fans thanked her and shook her hand.
