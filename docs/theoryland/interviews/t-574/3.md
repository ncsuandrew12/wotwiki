#### Sarayne

Following the reading was a Q & A session. We of course wrote that up, and you can find it here on Dragonmount. We filmed it as well, and you can view it on Youtube.

. The
[4th Age Podcast](http://www.dragonmount.com/Podcast/index.php)
also covered the event, so I am sure you will be able to listen to that as well. There were some great questions asked, and many resulted in a R.A.F.O., of course. Unfortunately, Team Jordan did not have any of their famous R.A.F.O. cards left at this point in the tour, but Maria did wear her R.A.F.O. hat!

Among the fans in attendance were Brandonâ€™s wife, Emily, several Tor employees, including Justin, Tom Doherty, Brandon's editor, Leigh Butler, and author Charlaine Harris.
*Towers of Midnight*
is dedicated to the major sources of Wheel of Time fandom. As a representative of this massive fandom, and as someone the book was dedicated to, Leigh Butler was asked to sit at the table and sign books as well.
