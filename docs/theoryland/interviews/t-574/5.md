# [Interview #574: TOM Tower Guard Report - Sarayne, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=574#5)

#### Sarayne

Throughout the night, Tower Guards did their best to entertain the masses with more trivia and prizes. A poster sized version of the
*Towers of Midnight*
cover art was raffled off, and won by Ali Weisz, who enthusiastically got it signed by everyone.

While this particular Barnes & Noble was not the most accommodating of places, the night was definitely a success. As tired as we felt afterward, I don't think any of us could begin to imagine how tired Brandon and Harriet must be after that tour. We appreciate all the work that goes into The Wheel of Time, from Brandon & Harriet, Maria & Alan, to Tor's employees and the huge fandom. The overall feel was of the night was excitement and appreciation, and we Tower Guards have already made plans with the Storm Leaders to come back next year so we can experience it all over again (and let someone else keep everyone in line)!

Thank you to everyone who helped make this event as amazing and fun as it was. Special thanks to Tower Guard Zeshan Hamdani, who spent a great deal of time on all of the filming and photography. You can find the rest of his photos in Dragonmount's gallery. If you had your picture taken, this is where you will find it!
