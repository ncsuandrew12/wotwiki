# [Interview #574: TOM Tower Guard Report - Sarayne, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=574#1)

#### Sarayne

The last stop on the tour, the New York signing went a little differently from the others. For the Tower Guards, it began a few hours earlier, in the Tor offices! We met with Brandon, Harriet, Maria, Alan, Leigh Butler, Tom Doherty, and a few other people from Tor. Afterward, we were given a tour of the office.

From there, we made our way to the bookstore! Upon our arrival, there was already a pretty long line waiting for us, headed off by last year's Storm Leaders. Luckily, we came prepared with trivia questions! We walked along the line in different places, randomly asking our questions and handing out prizes. Many fans were eager to answerâ€”some even asked trivia questions of their own! So many Wheel of Time fans gathered in one spot is a great opportunity to theorize and have epic discussions with other fans, so we of course did that as well.

Since it was a Monday evening, not as many people dressed up as we would like. In fact, there were only two people in costume. We saw an Asha'man, and Mat among the fans throughout the night. Thanks, you two!

As the line was ushered into the small event room of this Barnes & Noble, we were surprised to see how much of the line made it into the room. While the event space was definitely small, the fans did a great job of heeding the Tower Guards directions, and the line moved fluidly. For those who arrived too late, they were able to watch the reading and the Q & A on televisions that were set up outside the room.
