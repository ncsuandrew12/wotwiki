# [Interview #574: TOM Tower Guard Report - Sarayne, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=574#2)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The event officially began with Harriet’s reading from the prologue of
*Towers of Midnight*
(which can be viewed
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n___PaNUls0)
9mins 37secs). The part she read was Lan's point of view, as he began his solo march into the Blight. Serious and heavy, Harriet painted a clear picture for us listeners. The tone was lightened by Lan's thoughts of Nynaeve—those got a chuckle out of everyone, of course.
