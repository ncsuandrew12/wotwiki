## Entry #1

#### Hunter

Here's a tidbit from yesterday's signing:

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

Brandon revealed the gist of the two lines written for the outrigger novels. He says they will be released eventually, but the gists are: The first is about Mat waking up in a gutter somewhere, likely in Seanchan. The second is about Perrin heading out and thinking about how he may be forced to kill a friend.
