# [Interview #216, Entry #8]: KOD Signing Report - Allen Bryan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=216#8)

#### Allen Bryan

I got the first question: The Gasp Moment. I won't reveal the Gasp Moment (thank you, said RJ), but why write it in? There doesn't seem to be a plot reason, so it must be a literary reason. You said on your blog it was painful to write, so why??

#### Robert Jordan

Because Hell on Earth is about to break loose! Haven't you people got that in your heads yet? The Shadow is winning, it's the fifteenth round, our boy is on the ropes and the Shadow feels great and has tremendous punching power! Three minutes to go and there's only one chance. The Gasp Moment is their reaction to this.

#### Allen Bryan

My internal reaction: wow. nasty.
