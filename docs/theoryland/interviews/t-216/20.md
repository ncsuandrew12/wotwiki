# [Interview #216: KOD Signing Report - Allen Bryan, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=216#20)

#### Allen Bryan

I couldn't ask any more—he was already signing the next book—so I said good night (Thank you!) and left.

However, one more question formed in my mind as I walked home, along with a nonloony theory. (Hint to anyone going to a later signing!)

Behold my new Purple Ajah Theory:

The Purple Ajah, or Second Foundation Ajah, is real but not so cohesive as that. It is simply that the Purple Ajah consists of the librarians of the Thirteenth Depository.

It all fits, doesn't it? As the librarians, they have more detailed knowledge of the world than anyone else in the entire world, including the rest of the White Tower. By 13th Depository Tower Law, they cannot reveal the existence of the 13th Depository; but nothing stops them from acting on information IN it. So if Verin had been a 13th Depository librarian, she would know things that almost no one else would know—and use that knowledge.

Granted, most of the contents of the 13th Depository consist of the secret political history of Third Age Randland; but who knows? Secret techniques and prophecies could very well be in there as well.

Well, there you have it folks: RJ Does Boston.
