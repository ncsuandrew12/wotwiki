# [Interview #216: KOD Signing Report - Allen Bryan, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=216#10)

#### Allen Bryan

Is the Asha'man bond involuntarily linking?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Allen Bryan

(Waste of a good question; that's in the FAQ.)

#### Footnote

This actually appears to be one of the things
[the FAQ](http://www.steelypips.org/wotfaq/2_nondark/2.3_one-power/2.3.11_invol-rings.html)
was incorrect on. The first edition glossary entry for
[linking](https://docs.google.com/View?docID=0ARw8aVNqPsL5ZGNqc3BqcWdfNDg0dm1mZHZuZ2g&revision=_latest#linking)
in
*A Crown of Swords*
suggests that RJ had the Black Ajah method of forced linking in mind. The glossary reference was removed in later editions, however, and the practice was not mentioned again until
*Knife of Dreams*
.
