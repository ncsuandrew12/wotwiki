# [Interview #216: KOD Signing Report - Allen Bryan, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=216#19)

#### Allen Bryan

The Thirteenth Depository has never been revealed by a non-channeler librarian for three thousand years. How is this possible?

#### Robert Jordan

Because there are no non-channeler libarians; the librarians of the Thirteenth Depository are all Aes Sedai.

#### Allen Bryan

"Brown Ajah?" I asked.

#### Robert Jordan

He hesitated a moment. "Yes."
