# [Interview #216, Entry #17]: KOD Signing Report - Allen Bryan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=216#17)

#### Allen Bryan

Dyelin is like Cincinnatus of Rome. True or false?

#### Robert Jordan

True, pretty much, except Dyelin was never really offered power; she had it for a little while as Elayne's not-quite-authorized regent, but otherwise wasn't really called upon to save Andor the way Cincinnatus was called upon to save Rome. Otherwise, yes.

#### Allen Bryan

(Be'lal, whoever you are, I win a cookie.)
