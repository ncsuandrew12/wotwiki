# [Interview #216: KOD Signing Report - Allen Bryan, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=216#17)

#### Allen Bryan

Dyelin is like Cincinnatus of Rome. True or false?

#### Robert Jordan

True, pretty much, except Dyelin was never really offered power; she had it for a little while as Elayne's not-quite-authorized regent, but otherwise wasn't really called upon to save Andor the way Cincinnatus was called upon to save Rome. Otherwise, yes.
