# [Interview #35: LOC Signing Report - Brian Bax, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=35#3)

#### Brian Bax

I myself personally hope RJ doesn't try to kill himself to meet this deadline. Even though I love this series, I would hate to see the style and plot go to hell cause he was rushed, even thought I would tear my hair out for all his waiting. Even though RJ is a good writer, I don't think a writer with a judicial stenographer's hand would be able to make that deadline. I look forward to his next book, whenever it comes.
