# [Interview #35, Entry #1]: LOC Signing Report - Brian Bax](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=35#1)

#### Brian Bax

Since I lived in the sticks, I decided to differ from the norm and went to the signing thinking there wouldn't be a vast crowd, I was wrong
*sigh*
. I did manage to get all of my books signed which was great. I talked with RJ, but he appeared to be very distant which is understandable considering his position. What was really neat was that I was able to talk with Mrs. Jordan for 20 minutes. First off, she was an angel. She talked a lot about things that her husband couldn't since he was busy signing books.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

It turns out that she's an editor for Tor, not only for her husband's work but for others as well. She said that
*The Eye of the World*
took four years to write because he had to create all of the countries in Randland first. As has been mentioned by others on the net, his first idea for the series is going to be the last scene; his next was the breaking down of Rand's door in
*The Eye of the World*
. The rest has been
*ad lib*
. from there.
