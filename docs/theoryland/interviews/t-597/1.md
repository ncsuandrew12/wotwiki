Ta'veren Tees is the exclusive provider of Wheel of Time® apparel officially licensed by The Bandersnatch Group, Inc. Located at
[www.taverentees.com](https://taverentees.com/threads/)
, Ta'veren Tees is the first and only to sell T-shirts dedicated to the characters, themes, imagery and sayings found throughout Robert Jordan's epic series.

The initial store opening features six designs; two for women, two for men and two unisex. More shirts will be rolled out and added to the inventory over the coming months, but don't be fooled by the site name—shirts won't skew only towards the series' three famous

. Whether you'd like to throw a spear with the Maidens or secretly call yourself a Darkfriend, you will find something to wear on taverentees.com.

"With the first designs, we want to make sure we address the wants and needs of both male and female Wheel of Time® fans. We think that fans will be very happy with the first six shirts and the ones we will release in the near future," said Jeffrey Daniel, co-owner of Ta'veren Tees.

"It is important to us to take the Wheel of Time® world that Robert Jordan beautifully created and show our admiration for the series that we all love," said Sophie Decaudin, Ta'veren Tees co-owner. "This is something that hasn't been done before, there was a need for it, and we are excited to meet that need head on."

By creating these shirts, Daniel, Decaudin and Co-owner Kiley Kellermeyer hope to provide yet another avenue for WoT fans to express the love and devotion they feel towards the amazing world and spell-binding characters Jordan created.

"These designs are not only colorful, but reflect the themes and characters in the Wheel of Time® books," said Harriet Rigney, editor of the series and widow of James Rigney, the author. "They may not be able to stop cold steel, but they are extremely fashionable."

"We also salute Jeffrey, Kiley and Sophie for the design and layout of the Ta'veren Tees website," she continued. "It's a clean, uncluttered format that's easy to navigate and I'm sure the fans of the books will enjoy visiting often."

"Sometimes playful, often insightful, Ta'veren Tees are a welcomed addition to the line of products officially licensed by The Bandersnatch Group," she concluded.
