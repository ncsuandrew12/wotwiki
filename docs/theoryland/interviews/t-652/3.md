# [Interview #652: The Great Hunt 2011: Excerpts from Robert Jordan's notes, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=652#3)

#### FORCED-LINKING-STUDIES

#### Robert Jordan

When Careanne (Sareitha) is explaining about the impossibility of one woman forcing a link on another, this study should have survived from the Breaking, I think. Or, at least, it was begun during the Breaking. After this second study was begun and had gone on for a number of years, more of the original was discovered. With the destruction of the intervening years, relatively little is known, some of it only to the Black Ajah.

#### Footnote

This topic is explored a little more thoroughly
