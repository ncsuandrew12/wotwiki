# [Interview #268: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME FROM THE TOP, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=268#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Some of you have asked about my brothers and male relatives offering to shave their heads. Most have felt that since I did a voluntary slipping of my scalp, the pledge was not invoked yet. Good enough by me. The exception was Bill. Wilson is technically a cousin, but he has always been the fourth of the three Rigney brothers, and I'll tell you, I am as close to him as I am to my brother Reynolds, as close as I was my brother Ted. I could insert some pics here, but I will send them to Jason and let him post them.
