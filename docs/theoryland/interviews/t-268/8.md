# [Interview #268: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME FROM THE TOP, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=268#8)

#### Robert Jordan

Well, this has turned out much longer than I expected, and I am tired. I want to try a bowl of soup and maybe get an hour nap before I have to head across the street for my evening appointment.

Take care, guys.

Until the next time,

RJ
