# [Interview #268: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME FROM THE TOP, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=268#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For Sarah, I point out that I never expected Harriet to ride in a sidecar. She claims she wants to ride postillion so she can hang onto me. If we go with the bikes, I'll get her a bike of own and we'll see. Now what is this Scottish word? Then again, no. No. I have been ambushed too many times by white-haired grannies with pink-scrubbed cheeks and dewy-eyed schoolgirls whose skin was still moist with innocence. I'll not invite it.
