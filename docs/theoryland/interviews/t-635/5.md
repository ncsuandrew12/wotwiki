# [Interview #635: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: ALLOY illustrations, Blood and Bloody Ashes Shirt + Updates, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=635#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Several readers have reported that the ebook version of
*The Alloy of Law*
has images that are hard to read. Tor is working on a solution right now, but in the meantime, I've uploaded all of the images to their own page
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/The-Alloy-of-Law/page/66/The-Alloy-of-Law-Interior-Illustrations)
. You can see them below. I'm including a color version of the Elendel city map (by Isaac Stewart, who also runs the
*Mistborn*
and
*Stormlight Archive*
[T-shirt store](http://store.inkwing.com/)
) that doesn't appear in the book. And you can download a
[full-resolution broadsheet PDF](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/mistborn-fans-dont-forget-to-pick-up-todays-edition-of-the-elendel-daily)
if you are a Tor.com member. By the way, broadsheet (and Shallan's sketchbook) artist
[Ben McSweeney](http://inkthinker.net/)
will be with me at my Houston signing today, so fortunate readers there can get his autograph as well.
