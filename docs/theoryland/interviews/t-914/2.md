# [Interview #914: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Personal Touch, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=914#2)

#### Rebecca Cressman

Now Brandon, I know that you probably are asked this frequently, but when did you begin the creative writing process? Was it as a child?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well actually, I'm a little bit different than most authors. I didn't start as early as a lot of them. If you asked a lot of authors that question, they'll say, "Oh, I wrote my first book when I was in first grade, and ever since then I wanted to be a writer." Well, I didn't start off as a writer. I actually had a big period in my life where I didn't like to read, didn't like books at all. And it wasn't until I was in junior high and a teacher handed me a fantasy novel that it really all started.
