# [Interview #914: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Personal Touch, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=914#7)

#### Rebecca Cressman

Okay, I want to take us to one of your series right now that the children at school are being exposed to, and I'm thinking librarians around the nation are worried about the title,
*Alcatraz and the Evil Librarian*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes,
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
actually is what it's called. It is a story about a kid who discovers that librarians secretly rule the world.

#### Rebecca Cressman

So this is a juxtaposition of the typical look of a librarian who is quiet, unassuming, gently stacking books. And so you've kind of lifted the veil and said there's a whole underworld here.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, well part of the... This book was written mostly on a whim by me. I came up with a first line. I was just sitting one day and it just popped in my head, sometimes this happens, and it was, "So there I was, tied to an alter made from outdated encyclopedias about to get sacrificed to the dark powers by a cult of evil librarians." I jotted that title down and thought, "Wow, I have got to write that story. I have no idea what that story is, but I have got to write it." So I jotted it down, and it sat there and stewed in my head and on my notebook for a long time. And meanwhile
*The Da Vinci Code*
was getting very big, and I picked up that book and read it. You know, I kind of have something against all these conspiracy theory books. I don't think that there are any groups out there that are just like the Illuminati secretly ruling the world or anything like that. And
*The Da Vinci Code*
took it so seriously that I started to hypothesize something ridiculous, as kind of a mockery of that. And so I thought, well what have I got here? I can tell a story about a secret group ruling the world that would be completely ridiculous. Of course it expanded far beyond there. I wanted to tell a story also about people who had really dumb magical powers that they learned to use for their advantage. And there's a whole lot more to it than just that one concept. But that's where it started, as kind of my look at a silly conspiracy theory book.

#### Rebecca Cressman

Well congratulations, because the talk of the middle school, the talk of the school community is that this is just capturing the imaginations of children.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was a lot of fun to write.
