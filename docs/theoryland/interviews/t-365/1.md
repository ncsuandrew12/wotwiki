# [Interview #365: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Various Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=365#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm sorry to be so sparse with the posting this week. If you've been following the progress bar, you might have noticed that
*A Memory of Light*
jumped up one percent each day for the first three days of the week. I've been hitting the drafting hard, as I want to get a large chunk done before Worldcon distracts me in two weeks.

I've been working on mostly material that Mr. Jordan left behind, which is the larger reason why I've been able to move so quickly. There's still a lot to do on many of these sections he wrote, however. Some are in outline form, others were dictated in an almost 'screenplay' format without anything other than dialogue. Some others are complete as-is, and I can just drop them into the document without changes.

Overall, however, what has been left behind has allowed let me move at about double speed. We'll see if I can keep it up for another few days or so, as it would be nice to be at the 1/3rd mark by the end of the week. (Though that would take another 12k in another three days. Whew!)
