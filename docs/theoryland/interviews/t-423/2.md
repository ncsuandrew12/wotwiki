# [Interview #423: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Roundup of Thoughts, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=423#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

##### BEA

First off, BEA was awesome. It's generally about meeting booksellers, particularly those who work at independent bookstores. While I do appreciate all of you who work at the chains and pass my books on to readers, there's something special about the little independent booksellers, particularly those who focus on science fiction and fantasy. I got to meet several of those, which was a real treat, as well as some very enthusiastic folks from various sections of the publishing world. I'm now laden down with advance copies of books to read. We'll see if I can even get to many of them, with all of the writing I need to do . . .
