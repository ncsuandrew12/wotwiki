##### WRITING I NEED TO DO

And, speaking of that writing, things are going very well.
*The Way of Kings*
rewrite is proceeding quickly, and I should be done on-target. I'm feeling very good about the rewrite, though I won't be certain about my plans for it until I get through a few trouble areas later on. As for The Wheel of Time, I just got the Copyeditâ€”which is the final part of
*The Gathering Storm*
that needs to be done. This will distract me for another week or so from doing new material, but we'll see.
