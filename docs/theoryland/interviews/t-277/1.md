# [Interview #277: Robert Jordan's Blog: More pics from RJ, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=277#1)

#### Jason Denzel

Robert Jordan asked me to pass along some more photos. Here they are, and here's what he had to say about them:

#### Robert Jordan

Here are a few more pictures for you to post. First off, my niece Ariel. She didn't have her head, obviously, but what she did was neater, really. There is a charity called Locks for Love to which women can donate their hair if they have at least 10 inches that can be cut. This hair is then made into wigs for women and girls undergoing chemo. A righteous move on her part. (These are before and after, of course.)

Then there is my brother, Reynolds, who shaved as per promise, followed by one of me and my nephew Rey, a New Orleans Police Officer, who also shaved as per promise. And finally, for those who really do want to gaze at my bone structure—there are sickos and liars all over the place —a last pair of me sans hair.
