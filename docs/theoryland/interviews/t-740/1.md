# [Interview #740: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=740#1)

#### Satima Flavell

When I was invited to interview Brandon Sanderson, I did what any sensible writer would doâ€”I headed to
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson)
to read his bio. I knew, of course, that Sanderson had inherited the mantle of the late Robert Jordan, but I did not realise just how small a part of his oeuvre this work was.

Sanderson's output is veritably prodigious. Now in his late thirties, he began gaming when he was in his early teens. However, it was not until he reached university (he was studying science) that he realised he wanted to write. So he switched to the arts stream and wrote several novels during his youthful years. One of these,
*Elantris*
, proved to be publishable, and with revision most of the others were, too. So by drawing on this backlist, Sanderson has published no fewer than fourteen novels in the last eight years. Works of his have been translated into 20 languages!

Among the earliest to hit the shelves was
*The Final Empire*
, the first novel in the Mistborn series. And here is where the magic really starts.
