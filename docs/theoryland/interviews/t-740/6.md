# [Interview #740: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=740#6)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In a panel at Swancon, Sanderson warned fans against the danger of 'putting down' popular works. "I would hate to see our genre become snobbish, like the 'literary' scene. When I was doing my Advanced Degree in English, I was shocked by the literary snobbery I encountered. There has always been room for every taste within the spec-fic world, but now even some SF authors try to tell people that what they write isn't really speculative fiction, in an effort to distance themselves from popular books such as
*Eragon*
and
*Twilight*
. Don't let that kind of divisiveness happen here or we'll end up like the literary people, divided by snobbery."
