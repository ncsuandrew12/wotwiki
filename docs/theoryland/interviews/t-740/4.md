# [Interview #740: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=740#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson works best at night. "I get up about noon," he says, "write until five, and then spend a few hours with the family before starting work again about eight o'clock and then I write until the early morning hours. I often don't get to bed before three am." He did try getting up at what most people would consider to be a more normal hour, but after a few weeks his wife capitulated, saying, "This routine is making you miserable. Go back to being a night owl!"
