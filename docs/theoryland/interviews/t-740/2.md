# [Interview #740, Entry #2]: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=740#2)

When Robert Jordan, one of his favourite authors, died in 2007, Sanderson wrote a eulogy on his blog. (You can read it
[here](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/550/EUOLogy-Goodbye-Mr.-Jordan)
.) It came to the notice of Harriet McDougal, Jordan's widow. She had promised her late husband that she would ensure the series was finished, and as an editor of note herself, she was in a good position to choose a worthy successor. After being moved by Sanderson's eulogy, she hunted for his work, discovered
*The Final Empire*
and knew she'd found a writer worthy of bearing her husband's sceptre.

"The call came out of the blue," says Sanderson. "I felt excited, humbled and honoured all once." It was decided that the projected final volume,
*A Memory of Light*
, would be split in three. The first,
*The Gathering Storm*
was published in 2009, followed in 2010 by
*Towers of Midnight*
. Fans eagerly await the release of
*A Memory of Light*
in January 2013.
