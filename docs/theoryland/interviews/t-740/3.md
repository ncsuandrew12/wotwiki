# [Interview #740, Entry #3]: A Chat with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=740#3)

#### Satima Flavell

I remark that Sanderson's style had changed between
*Mistborn*
and his latest series, The Stormlight Archive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Well," says Sanderson, "I try to use a different style for each series. But I've also learnt a lot from working on The Wheel of Time. Jordan's writing is so detailed, so subtle, so layered, that I can't help being influenced by it."

#### Satima Flavell

He has, by the way, now used up all his backlist:
*The Way of Kings*
is the last of those early books and after this year he expects his output to slow down.
