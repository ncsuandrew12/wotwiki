# [Interview #695: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Mistborn Adventure Game Out Now + Updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=695#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The biggest news for this week is that the long-awaited
[Mistborn Adventure Game](http://www.crafty-games.com/content/buy-mistborn-adventure-game)
tabletop RPG from Crafty Games is now available in ebook form. The hardcover and paperback copies will come next month or so, and we are planning a local release party for those once we have more details on the exact date. Anyway, I do hope to be able to share more thoughts on the exciting release of this game once I can take a breather from writing
*A Memory of Light*
(that deadline is coming up fast, and I'm very hard at work on it).
