# [Interview #1156: Calamity-Houston, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1156#7)

#### Cadmium

You’re in Houston, questions of Oil & Gas and energy sources will be naturally be bandied about.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Naturally.

#### Cadmium

Is the gasoline on Scadrial a fossil fuel or biodiesel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh. Hmm. Well It’s fossil fue… no. What they’re using now is mostly biodiesel, I think. It’s not something we really talked out.

#### Cadmium

Ok, we had a whole thread on 17th Shard and even discussed how scientifically fossil fuels could have been put into place during the Catacendre.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, fossil fuels are possible, and I don’t want to seem like I’m clearly giving credence to those that believe in a Young Earth, but Scadrial \*is\* a relatively young planet. Relatively.

#### Cadmium

Young Earth doesn’t bother me, though I know I’m not the majority. Where on Scadrial is it being produced? No mention of refineries in Elendel or the Roughs.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Where on Scadrial… Well It’s… I’m going to have to RAFO that for now. It starts to touch on questions of the future as they will need more fuels for travel and they’ll need to look for different sources.
We’ll just leave it at “If fossil fuels are there, they were placed intentionally.”

#### Cadmium

Okay. I just didn't see any mention of oil derricks in the Roughs or fuel producing infrastructure in Elendel. I’ll just continue to hold out hope that we see Wax fighting some big battle all around an oil derrick.
(I start eyeballing the last question on my notepad trying to decide if I'm going to push it.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ok, well, I need to move on, but thank you, those were really great questions. Good to see you again.
