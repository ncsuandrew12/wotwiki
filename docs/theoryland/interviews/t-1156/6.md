#### Cadmium

Who cut Lopen’s food for him while he was one-handed?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs) Well, I’d have to say he doesn’t need anyone to cut his food for him, he’d just kind of grr, arrgh (pantomimes, stabbing something on table with fork and ripping into it with teeth) Because he’s The Lopen right, and he can take care of his food himself. Great question. Very unique.
