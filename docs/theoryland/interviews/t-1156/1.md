#### Question

The person in front of me asked if Brandon invents ridiculous accents for Wayne just to see if Michael Kramer can do different voices.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it's not just to torture Michael, though Brandon really enjoys hearing how Michael reads the different voices and he's amazed at the various accents, and he listens to all of the audiobooks at least once...
However, Brandon will say he has one voice planned for Wayne that does make him giggle when he thinks of Michael Kramer having to do it. He's going to LAFO (Listen and Find Out) which voice it is, but we'll all likely be rolling around in tears when it happens.
