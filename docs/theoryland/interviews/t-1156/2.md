#### Cadmium

"Would it actually be possible for a Kandra to "become a rusting bunny?" Also, Thanks for Wayne. He's my favorite character.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, But it would be Tough. They must keep a certain mass to maintain intelligence and a bunny is very small.

#### Cadmium

But obviously being a Harvey sized bunny is totally doable.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah... Good movie reference.
