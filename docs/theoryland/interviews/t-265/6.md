# [Interview #265: Robert Jordan's Blog: MORE THANK YOUS, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=265#6)

#### Robert Jordan

For Doctor, I've pretty much settled on channeling, if that is the proper word, myself. It seems to work. Although that first day, at lunch, I did slip briefly into Brando from
*Apocalypse Now*
, and I must say that afterward we could carry on a pleasant conversation at our table without any bother from brainless chatter from tables around us. I may keep that one in reserve.

That's about it for now.

Remember guys,
*Illegitimei no carborundum*
!
