#### Monkeyman

Nobody who can channel
*saidin*
or
*saidar*
can sense the True Power. And, since the Forsaken don't seem to notice Moridin channeling the True Power, is it detectable at all (besides by a
*gholam*
)? That is, can someone already holding the True Power sense another using it?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Not by any method we've seen yet.
