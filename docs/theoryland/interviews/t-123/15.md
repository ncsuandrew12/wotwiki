#### Kelton

Mr. Jordan, I would like to thank you on behalf of everyone at the Dancing Dragon Tavern for creating such a wonderful series of books, if it weren't for you and your books we wouldn't be the group of close-knit friends we have become. Would you possibly consider mentioning the tavern in passing in one of your future books?
