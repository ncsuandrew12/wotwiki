#### Ran

Are Dreaming and Dreamwalking essentially just different names for the same Talent, or are they separate Talents that often occur together? The illustrated guide seemed to confuse the issue somewhat.

#### Robert Jordan

No. They're very different. A Dreamwalker can enter dreams. But a Dreamer only "understands" dreams, though Dreamwalkers are generally Dreamers, too.
