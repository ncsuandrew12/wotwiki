#### ArabianKn

Mr. Jordan, since Gaidal Cain has been born only recently in the WOT universe, how is it that he will grow old enough to fight in the upcoming battle (Tarmon Gai'don)? It will take at least 15 years for him to grow big enough to fight. and what about the other Heroes? Will they also be reborn, or will they remain to be recalled only by the Horn?

#### Robert Jordan

Who says that what Gaidal has been reborn to do is to fight the Last Battle? There is more to do to keep the Pattern on course than the Last Battle.
