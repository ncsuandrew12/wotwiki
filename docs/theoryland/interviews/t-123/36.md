Thanks for the great questions everybody, we'll be chatting with another author in two weeks. Remember...This chat was cosponsored by Asimov's Science Fiction, www.asimovs.com. You'll also find great stories here on SCIFI as part of our SCI Fiction series edited by Ellen Datlow. We'll open the floor now.
