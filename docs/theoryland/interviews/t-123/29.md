#### LadyJ

Mr. Jordan, How do you keep track of all the sub-plots and names and lives? Do you have a room decorated with color-coded index cards?

#### Robert Jordan

I keep track of them in my head. I have some files if I need them. And I have many cultural files. But the story and the lives are all in my head.
