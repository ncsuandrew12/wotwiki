#### Akira

Mr. Jordan, do you have any advice for aspiring fantasy writers (such as myself)?

#### Robert Jordan

Write. When you've written something send it out. As soon as it's in the mail write more. Never stop writing and never stop sending material out. Write and keep writing. And keep trying to get published. If a story is on the shelf it isn't writing. Whatever you've written isn't complete without a reader.
