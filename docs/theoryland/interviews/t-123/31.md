#### Crysa

I was wondering if there have been any other authors approach you about writing other ages, such as the Age of Legends or Hawkwing's time? If they did, would you allow it?

#### Robert Jordan

I've never been approached. And no, I wouldn't. When I'm done I'll move on to another Universe.
