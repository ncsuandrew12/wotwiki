#### Shawnyve

An odd question, What exactly does it mean when you describe the clothing in the Wheel of Time as being 'blue slashed with cream'? Is there any historical dress in that still to get a more accurate picture of how you describe it?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. There is a historical dress much like it. A gap that can close or open. It's been used throughout European history.
