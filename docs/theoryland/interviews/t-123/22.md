Mr. Jordan, How much of the story is already planned out in your mind, and how much is supplied as you go along in the writing process?

#### Robert Jordan

I know the major outline of the story. Various characters' lives. Who lives and dies. The fates of nations. And I know the final scene. Minor details, or smaller details, I leave until I'm writing. It flows organically that way. I thought it would take five books, by the way. :) I was optimistic!
