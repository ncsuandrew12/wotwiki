Mr. Jordan, I know that this series has been your life's work, and great work it is. What I would like to know is how old were you when your had you first "insight" to or for the series, and what inspired you to write the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

I guess I began thinking about what would become the series in my 20s and that was a long time ago. I spent ten years juggling things in my head before I even tried writing it down.
