#### Jahar

Mr Jordan. I was a bit disappointed in
*Winter's Heart*
. The last chapter in
*The Path of Daggers*
has the Salidar Aes Sedai stepping through a gateway in eyesight of Dragonmount. In
*Winter's Heart*
, you have them still in Murandy. Did they get too cold to stay??

#### Robert Jordan

No.
*Winter's Heart*
overlaps the ending of the last book.
