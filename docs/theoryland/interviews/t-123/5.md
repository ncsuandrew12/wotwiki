With the storyline as it is now it seems unlikely that the new book will finish the series. How many more books do you feel will be in this series?

#### Robert Jordan

There will be at least three more books. I've known the last scene of the last book for 15 years, but I've always been overly optimistic about how much I can get into any one book, so hopefully three more.
