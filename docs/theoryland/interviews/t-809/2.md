#### Sabrina Fish

I would like to interview you about your most recent Mistborn novel,
*The Alloy of Law*
. Your Mistborn Trilogy ultimately inspired me to actually put fingers to keyboard and begin writing my very first novel and I feel it only appropriate to try to return the favor by helping others find your books as well.
