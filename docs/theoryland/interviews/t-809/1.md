# [Interview #809: A Feast of Fantasy Interview, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=809#1)

#### Sabrina Fish

When we decided that we would do author interviews to start off the month of July, my mind instantly jumped to my most favorite author, Brandon Sanderson. I wasnâ€™t sure that such a successful and popular author would have time for my interview questions, but I knew I had to at least try. Imagine my surprise, when 3 weeks later I received answers to my interview questions. I was and still am ecstatic.
