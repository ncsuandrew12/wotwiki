How do you react to a bad review of one of your books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the type of bad review. There are, on Amazon, one-star reviews of my favorite books. Legitimate one-star reviews—people who just didn’t like the book. There’s a lot of variety to people out there, and my books are not right for everyone. No book is. How do I react to negative reviews? I just keep on going.
