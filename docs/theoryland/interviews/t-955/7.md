Brandon was very gracious and upbeat the whole night, despite a raw throat. Harriet must get up early in the morning to practice that smile of hers. I don't understand how you can give someone a smile that is warm and welcoming while simultaneously having an infuriating I-know-something-you-don't-know quality. Maybe I need to work on my eye-twinkle skills. Thanks to both of them for taking time out of their busy lives to visit with the fans.

And, on a personal note, I was able to give Brandon, Harriet, and Jennifer Liang each a draft copy of the novel I've been working on. If anyone on this thread has a few hours to kill, I'd be happy to share it with you, too. Just drop me a message.
