A few other items from the Atlanta signing on Thursday. Sorry it's taken so long to get to them, but after the signing, I immediately got into a car and drove 10 hours to a ski resort. First world problems all up in this. I volunteered to handle fans' cameras for pictures up at the signing table, so I didn't get quite close enough to overhear much up there, but I did take some notes during the general Q&A.
