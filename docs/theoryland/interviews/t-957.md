## [Entry #1](./t-957/1)

#### BlairJ

I have long been a lurker on these forums (a long time), but I thought I would break my silence as I happened to be at the Baltimore signing. I thought about calling out to see if anyone there was a member of the 17th Shard forums (I figured there would be a few).

## [Entry #2](./t-957/2)

#### BlairJ

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I did ask about
*Mistborn: Birthright*
and apparently it is going to make it's way to the next generation of consoles, so it should be a very nice representation. I did find out that Brandon is still writing 100% of the dialogue (there were some rumors a while back that he wouldn't be) and that it is well underway.

## [Entry #3](./t-957/3)

#### BlairJ

Do not mean to derail the Shadesmar conversation. Just thought this would be a great time and thread to add my first of many posts!
