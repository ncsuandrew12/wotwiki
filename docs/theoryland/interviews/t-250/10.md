*Knife of Dreams*
, Beonin does speak wrongly, and as much as I would like to call it an editing error, it is such only in that neither the editor, the copy editor, nor my assistant caught it. Homer nodded, and I blipped. It will be corrected in the next printing.

#### Footnote

In the first edition, Beonin stated that to Travel one must know the destination, and to Skim one must know the starting point. (It's the other way around.)
