#### Robert Jordan

Thanks for the CD, Deadsy. I liked it. It seems very reminiscent of Pentangle at times, but then a lot of groups do. I saw an article somewhere or other that claimed Pentangle had more influence on the music that followed than the Beatles and as much as the Beachboys. The second is quite a claim to make. Remarkable for a group that did two albums—nybody out there old enough to remember vinyl? Hey, I still have some of my 45s!—in the late 60s then vanished.
