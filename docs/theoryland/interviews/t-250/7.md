# [Interview #250: Robert Jordan's Blog: I'M BAAAA-AAACK, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=250#7)

#### Robert Jordan

For kcf, Tuon is stating a misbelief, really, a Seanchan urban folk tale, if you will. The Seanchan no longer know about Foretelling—though they are beginning to hear reports—but they have memories of the knowledge, you might say. There memories have gotten twisted into the widespread belief that any
*damane*
can tell your fortune. This belief is strengthened by the fact that some
*damane*
actually can Foretell, and more of them than on "this" side of the Aryth Ocean, a facet of
*sul'dam*
remaining in the breeding pool with the result that there are a higher percentage of women who potentially could channel among the Seanchan than on the Eastern side of the ocean. And also a higher percentage of many Talents.
