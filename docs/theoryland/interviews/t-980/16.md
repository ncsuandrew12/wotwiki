# [Interview #980, Entry #16]: Waygate Foundation Q&A](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#16)

#### Question

Robert Jordan at one point said that Beidomon had been born again and was out and about currently. (I know this was during the time of his Blog, while I was on Wotmania, so it’s been impossible for me to find the actual comment.) I always assumed he was Bayle Domon (B.domon), but that seems almost too blatant to me. IS he Bayle, or is he someone else, completely unimportant? (Wouldn't it be working on his Karmic balance, helping Egeanin/Leilwin to help with the Last Battle, to help make up for what he did previously?)

#### Maria Simons

I could only find two quotes where Robert Jordan spoke of Beidomon and his possible appearance in the current age. In the first, he confirmed that Beidomon was not Mordeth, and in the second, when asked if Beidomon was someone in the current Age, he answered "RAFO." I have not yet found anything to indicate who—if anyone—Beidomon is in the current Age, but if we come across it buried in the notes, it will be included in the encyclopedia.
