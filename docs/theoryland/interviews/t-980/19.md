#### Question

Will there be a list of
*The Prophecies of the Dragon*
and the dark prophecies? Also the other prophecies from the Aiel and the Atha’an Miere?

#### Maria Simons

We hope to include the prophecies that we know of; Robert Jordan did not have a complete
*Prophecies of the Dragon*
written—that would have been an entire book in itself. He knew the general gist of the prophecies, and came up with pieces as he needed them.
