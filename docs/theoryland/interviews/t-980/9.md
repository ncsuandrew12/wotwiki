# [Interview #980: Waygate Foundation Q&A, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#9)

#### Question

Does the dagger from Shadar Logoth have a name besides Mat's dagger or Fain's dagger? (referring to an AOL interview from so very long ago where someone referred to it as Shadar Mandarb.)

#### Maria Simons

We could find nothing in the notes referring to the dagger as such, but I seem to have a vague memory of at least hearing that phrase before. It does seem to be an apt moniker for it.

#### Footnote

This nickname appears to have been adopted by the members of the rasfw-rj Usenet group; the term is used on
[their FAQ](http://www.steelypips.org/wotfaq/1_dark/1.7_sl-fain/1.7.2_mshin-mashadar.html)
. We can find no mention of the AOL interview in question; there were several, and we might be missing one or more of them.
