#### Question

I realize that the two outrigger novels that Jim had planned won't be published, but I'm still curious about the story that would take place in them. I'm hoping that the history that would have been contained within those stories (Tam's life while he was away from the Two Rivers and what led Moiraine and Lan to the Two Rivers) will come to light in the Encyclopedia. Not really a question, but a comment nonetheless!

#### Maria Simons

There is a little confusion here: there were two more prequels planned (with the subjects mentioned here), and three outriggers taking place after the Last Battle. We have about two sentences regarding the outriggers. While I promise that the encyclopedia will contain all we know about Moiraine and Tam from Robert Jordan's notes, he did not leave fleshed-out outlines for the prequels, either, so we can't promise too much.
