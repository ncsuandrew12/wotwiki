#### Waygate Foundation

Thanks again to everyone who submitted questions for our Team Jordan Q&A during the
*A Memory of Light*
tour. We were excited to see the questions, and even more excited to share the answers!

This sneak peek into the future content of the Wheel of Time Encyclopedia is brought to you by Team Jordan in support of our "A Story Begins" campaign benefiting Patrick Rothfuss'
[Worldbuilders](http://worldbuilders.org/)
charity. To help us reach our goal and release a full page of the future encyclopedia, please consider contributing a donation using the "Support" form on the right!

Warningâ€”a lot of these answers contain SPOILERS. Read at your own risk! Each answer has been supplied by Team Jordan, and was written by Maria Simons, continuity editor of the Wheel of Time. Maria and the Team have been very generous with their time, and will provide as many answers as they can.
