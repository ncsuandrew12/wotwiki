# [Interview #980: Waygate Foundation Q&A, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#17)

#### Question

Did Jain Charin become a servant of the Shadow in part due to Moiraine having bonded Lan? He must have felt it a huge betrayal, the last Malkieri king submitting to being Bonded after the White Tower failed to help Malkier. Was he the one to train Isam once he became a Darkfriend?

#### Maria Simons

No, he didn't become a servant of the Shadow because Moiraine bonded Lan. He did not become a servant of the Shadow of his own free will. The Shadow used him and Graendal Compelled him. He did not train Isam.
