#### Question

In
*Lord of Chaos*
, ch 21, "To Shadar Logoth", Lews Therin whispers to Rand: "There is darkness here. Blackness blacker than black. If the Dark One chose to live among men, he would choose here" and then "I must kill Demandred" to which Rand responds "Does Demandred have some connection to Shadar Logoth?" And Lews Therin says nothing. So...does he? Or is it alluding to the possibility that Barid Bel went seeking a way to defeat the Shadow which ended up in corrupting him in the same way Mordeth was corrupted?

#### Maria Simons

I can find nothing relating Demandred to Shadar Logoth; note that after the Demandred bit, Lews Therin starts talking about Ishamael and Lanfear, and doesn't appear to be answering Rand's questions at all. I think that it's safe to assume that Lews Therin is just rambling insanely.
