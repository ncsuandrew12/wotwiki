# [Interview #980: Waygate Foundation Q&A, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#23)

#### Question

Just to clear it up, cause I really dislike arguing with people: just to have it out there, in big BOLD letters: Brandon
[did confirm](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#45)
in his January 2013 Twitter chat that Hopper was "the Broken Wolf, whom Death has known", yes? ("The Broken Wolf was Perrinâ€™s spirit guide.") Because this one aggravates me almost as much as Olver/Gaidal Cain and Taimandred, especially when people insist it was Rodel Ituralde.

#### Maria Simons

Yes, Hopper was "the Broken Wolf, whom Death has known."
