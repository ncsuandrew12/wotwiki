#### Question

Did Ishamael/Moridin send "Noal" to Mat to kill him, or because he knew Mat would be going to the Tower of Ghenjei, and wanted "Noal" to kill Moiraine (since he knew that she was alive after collecting Lanfear from the 'Finn)? Reasoning behind the question: In
*The Great Hunt*
, Moiraine tells Siuan that they are part of the Prophecies, so it would make sense that Ishamael/Moridin would know of Moiraine's future importance (since he's an "expert" on all the various prophecies) and seek to have her killed (the Draghkhar attack in
*The Dragon Reborn*
, "Noal" going to the Tower of Ghenjei as an assassin, etc.).

#### Maria Simons

No, Ishamael/Moridin did not send Noal to Mat, either to kill him or to kill Moiraine. Someone else sent Noal to Ebou Dar for other purposes, and he found Mat more or less by accident.
