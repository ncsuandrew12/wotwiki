#### Question

What was the Ring of Tamyrlin—could it have been the twisted stone
*ter’angreal*
?

#### Maria Simons

The Ring of Tamyrlin was
[defined in the expanded glossary included in
*To the Blight*](https://sites.google.com/site/hcfflibrary/glossary#ring-of-tamyrlin)
(the second half of
*The Eye of the World*
repacked for YA readers); it was a legendary ring, believed mythical by most people, worn by the leader of the Aes Sedai during the Age of Legends. Stories about the Ring of Tamyrlin include that it was an
*angreal*
or
*sa’angreal*
or
*ter’angreal*
of immense power. It supposedly was named after the first person to learn how to tap into the Source and channel the One Power, and in some tales, was actually made by that man or woman. It was definitely not the twisted stone
*ter’angreal*
.
