# [Interview #980: Waygate Foundation Q&A, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#2)

#### Question

Will the encyclopedia be written in a way that someone reading the series the first time can reference it without learning spoilers? That was the hardest thing for me first time through.

#### Maria Simons

No, I don’t think so. If we are to avoid spoilers, it would require Rand’s entry to say "A young man from the Two Rivers, the son of Tam and Kari al'Thor." Anything else would spoil
*The Eye of the World*
. And it would only get worse from there. We wouldn’t even be able to reference Asmodean’s death, because his dying is a spoiler for
*The Fires of Heaven*
.
