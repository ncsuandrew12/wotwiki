#### Question

What are the three oaths which bind Darkfriends?

#### Maria Simons

1) I shall obey all commands given by those placed above me in service to the Great Lord. 2) I shall prepare for the day of the Great Lord's return. 3) I swear not to betray the Great Lord, to keep my secrets until the hour of my death. It should be noted that these were taken straight from Robert Jordan's notes, where he had added "May vary the wording a little."

#### Footnote

Verin says "You can double-cross other Darkfriends, you can turn against the Chosen if you can justify it." To justify turning against the Chosen, you could argue that a specific Chosen was not placed above you by the Great Lord himself.
