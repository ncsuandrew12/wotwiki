#### Question

How did Tam come to have a heron-mark sword?

#### Maria Simons

It was given to him by the King of Illian during Tamâ€™s service with the Illianer Companions. We do not know what he did to become a blademaster.

#### Footnote

What Maria says here is what RJ said (reported by Erica Sadun
[in 1994](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=25#2)
). In
*The Gathering Storm*
Chapter 47, Tam tells Rand that he became a blademaster by killing a blademaster in front of witnesses. The general fan explanation is that Tam refused to take his sword, but was essentially forced to take it by the King of Illian.
