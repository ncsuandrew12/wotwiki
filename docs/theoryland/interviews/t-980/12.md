#### Question

Trollocs invade the Borderlands pretty regularly. Do they invade from the Blight in the Aiel and Seanchan lands as well?

#### Maria Simons

No, they don’t—not much, anyway. The Trollocs call the Waste
*Djevik K’shar*
, which means the Dying Ground. Elyas is of the opinion that Trollocs "wouldn’t go a hundred miles into the Waste if all the Myrddraal in the Blight were driving them." And according to
*The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time*
, all of the Trollocs and Myrddraal were completely wiped out in Seanchan during the millennium after the Breaking.
