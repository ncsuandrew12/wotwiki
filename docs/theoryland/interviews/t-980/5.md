# [Interview #980: Waygate Foundation Q&A, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#5)

#### Question

Based on the weather of the different lands, it seems like Randland is in the northern hemisphere of the planet. Are there lands to the south of Randland? The Seanchan came from the West across the Aryth Oceanâ€”is Shara on their western border?

#### Maria Simons

There is a map of the whole world of
*The Wheel of Time in The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time*
; it shows Randland to be almost totally in the northern hemisphere, with a small southern portion of Shara being in the southern hemisphere. Below Randland, at apparently the same longitude though covering a much smaller area, is the Land of Madmen. Seanchan is spread over the northern and southern hemispheres, and on its western border is the Morenal Ocean; that ocean is also the eastern border of Shara.
