# [Interview #980: Waygate Foundation Q&A, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=980#6)

#### Question

One that I can't ever get an answer on: How did Thom know Padan Fain? In
*The Eye of the World*
, he says he recognized Fain and he scornfully says Fain "is always one to carry bad news quickly, and the worse, the faster. Thereâ€™s more raven in him than man." This implies more than a passing knowledge of the man.

#### Maria Simons

Both Padan Fain and Thom Merrilin made their livings by traveling from one small village to another in a reasonably small area. They had simply been in the same village at the same time on multiple occasions. Add to that Thom's proclivity for collecting information, and you have a very simple explanation.
