A few random pieces of catch-up news for today. The ebook for

This week the Writing Excuses podcast has another
[brainstorming episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2013/04/07/)
, where I come up with a concept for a short story and Mary, Howard, and Dan help me toss ideas around for it.

The annual Locus poll is live.
[Anyone can vote](http://www.locusmag.com/Magazine/2013/PollAndSurvey.html)
for what you consider to be 2012's best SF novel (among many other categories), but Locus subscribers' votes count double. The deadline is April 15th.

My agent Joshua Bilmes put up
[a blog post](http://brilligblogger.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-tachyons-soul.html)
about how
*The Emperor's Soul*
went from concept to Hugo nomination in 13 months.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Tor.com is continuing its reread of
*The Way of Kings*
. This week's article covers
[chapters 1 and 2](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/04/the-way-of-kings-reread-chapter-1-and-chapter-2)
, which include Kaladin's introduction.

And here's the
[newest video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlnFqu2rfdQ&hd=1)
of me writing a chapter from
*Words of Radiance*
. This is the climax, but there are two short videos after this. I'll upload the sped-up version of the chapter the same day I upload the final video.
