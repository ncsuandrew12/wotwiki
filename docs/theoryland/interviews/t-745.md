If you missed it on

or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
, here's the link to my Suvudu Cage Match writeup of
[Moiraine vs. Kelsier](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/03/cage-match-2012-round-4-moiraine-damodred-versus-kelsier.html)
. Don't expect an epic battle. I don't have the time to spare to write something like that in this case. Instead, I played it very tongue-in-cheek. I flipped a coin to decide who won, then wrote something that made it seem logical. Warning: it not only contains huge spoilers for both series, but a lot of Wheel of Time and Mistborn in-jokes. If you disagree with the results of my coin flip, feel free to vote however you wish in the cage match poll.

This week's episode of Writing Excuses features Mary, Howard, and I talking about
[Man vs. Nature](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/03/25/writing-excuses-7-13-man-vs-nature/)
. If you're as confused about that as Howard was, it's one of the basic narrative conflict archetypes (along with Man vs. Man and Man vs. Self). Check it out.

There's also a new
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
annotation up. This one covers
[chapter six](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/450/Alcatraz-Chapter-Six)
.
