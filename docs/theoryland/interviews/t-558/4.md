#### Question

One question I wrote down when somenoe asked was: "Will we see Demandred in the book?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*Big Smile\* "What do you mean? You saw Demandred all the time! He shows up all the time!"

#### Revised Question

"Will we find who Demandred's alter-ego is?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm gonna have to RAFO that one."
