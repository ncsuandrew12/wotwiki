First some updates. The naming rights auction for a Stormlight (or other) character that I
[talked about last week](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1040)
ends in 38 hours, as do most of Orion's
[other auctions](http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/orionbooksforcharity/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_trksid=p3686)
benefiting the UK charity
[Samaritans](http://www.samaritans.org/)
.

My assistant Peter has put up
[another chapter](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/137/Warbreaker-Prime-Mythwalker-Chapter-Seventeen)
of my abandoned 2001 novel
*Mythwalker*
. Quite a bit happens in this one. And he also put together another

This week's Writing Excuses podcast episode features Ellen Kushner and Delia Sherman talking with Mary and Dan at the recent World Fantasy convention.

is the topicâ€”books that don't fit well in any particular genre category.

Many of the booksellers I visited during my recent tour still have signed copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
. Check my events calendar to see if I'll be near you anytime soon. If I won't be, give one of the following stores a call. (You can also
[tell me your city](http://brandonsanderson.com/contact/?topic=9)
and I'll email you when I'm visiting nearby.)

[Mysterious Galaxy](http://www.mystgalaxy.com/)
  
7051 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. Suite #302
  
San Diego, CA 92111
  
(858) 268-4747
  
Alone among the stores on this list, Mysterious Galaxy has signed copies of a lot of my other books, not just
*The Alloy of Law*
, and will ship worldwide. Give them a call.

[Murder by the Book](http://www.murderbooks.com/signed-books-m-z)
, Houston
  
2342 Bissonnet
  
Houston, TX 77005
  
(713) 524-8597
  
(888) 424-2842
  
Murder by the Book's copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
are signed not only by me but also by interior artist Ben McSweeney, who illustrated the book's newspaper broadsheet.

[Chapters Metrotown](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/home/storeLocator/storeDetails/762/?cookieCheck=1)
  
Metropolis, Metrotown 4700 Kingsway
  
Burnaby, BC V5H 4M1, Canada
  
(604) 431-0463
  
This Chapters will have your cheapest shipping option for delivery anywhere in Canada.

[Forbidden Planet](http://forbiddenplanet.com/78150-the-alloy-of-law-hardcover/)
  
179 Shaftesbury Avenue
  
WC2H 8JR London, United Kingdom
  
0207 420 3666
  
Forbidden Planet will also ship worldwide, but they're probably your best bet for getting a signed copy of
*The Alloy of Law*
in Europe. Their copies are all the UK edition of of the book. They also have some signed
*The Way of Kings*
split paperbacks:
[Part 1](http://forbiddenplanet.com/72925-stormlight-archive-book-1-the-way-of-kings-part-1/)
,
[Part 2](http://forbiddenplanet.com/72926-stormlight-archive-book-1-the-way-of-kings-part-2/)
.

I will eventually add this book to my
[website store](http://brandonsanderson.com/store/)
as well, but I won't do that until it has been on the shelf for about a year and the mass market paperback has been released already. Please support your local bookseller.
