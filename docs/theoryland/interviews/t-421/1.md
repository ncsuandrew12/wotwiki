# [Interview #421: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Two Interviews, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=421#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've done two interviews recently. There's not much new information in them for those who read the blog regularly—pretty much me answering questions I've answered before. But I thought I'd post them for you in case you're interested.
