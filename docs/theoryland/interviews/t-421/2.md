#### Brandon Sanderson

Let's see . . . other fun news. Tour schedule is coming together for the year. Nothing is set yet, but there's a good chance for
*The Gathering Storm*
that I'll be doing a midnight party here in Utah, then fly and do a 'day of' release party in Charleston. After that, I'll be off to haunt the usual suspects. New York, DC, Portland, Seattle, LA. I AM trying to throw in a few places I've never been before, just like every year, but I can't go everywhere. (Not and still have time to write, at least.) I've asked to be sent to Arizona and Minneapolis, both places I've never gone before, as well as a few more places that I don't want to mention as I don't want to get hopes up.

For
*Warbreaker*
, I'll pretty much just be doing local signings for now. I didn't want to tour in June, then do it again in November. It's just too exhausting, and I've got too much to work on right now. So expect Utah events for
*Warbreaker*
(including a release party.) Yes, Sam Weller's will be doing signed editions mailed to those outside of Utah, just like we did with Mistborn Three. (Still not sure if this will happen for
*The Gathering Storm*
or not.) I should have details for you by the end of the week on both the release party and the Signed/numbered editions you can order from Sam Weller's.
