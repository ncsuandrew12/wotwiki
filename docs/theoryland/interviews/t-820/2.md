# [Interview #820: COT Signing Report - Kean, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=820#2)

#### Robert Jordan

What Jordan said, specifically, btw, was this:

Someone figured out who killed Asmodean. Thus, it is possible to do so with the clues provided, and he doesn't feel the need to provide more. Further, he refused to in any way indicate who the person with the correct answer is or how to get in touch with said person.
