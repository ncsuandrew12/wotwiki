# [Interview #1044: Fantasy Faction Interview: Brandon Sanderson Stormlight Interview, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1044#12)

#### Question

Could any type of spren bond with a person (even if the results wouldn't be a Knight Radiant)? Or only the ones associated with a branch of the Knights?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh, that's an excellent question. This is something theoretically possible for a lesser spren to achieve.
