#### Question

Could any type of spren bond with a person (even if the results wouldn't be a Knight Radiant)? Or only the ones associated with a branch of the Knights?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh, that's an excellent question. This is something theoretically possible for a lesser spren to achieve.
