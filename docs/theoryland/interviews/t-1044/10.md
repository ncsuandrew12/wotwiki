# [Interview #1044: Fantasy Faction Interview: Brandon Sanderson Stormlight Interview, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1044#10)

#### Question

In
*The Way of Kings*
, when Shallan zones out and draws a picture of a dead noble at a dinner table, was she drawing her own father after she killed him with her shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh, good question! You will want to read
*Words of Radiance*
, where her flashbacks may indeed involve this scene that she drew.
