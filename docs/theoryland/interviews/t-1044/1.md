# [Interview #1044, Entry #1]: Fantasy Faction Interview: Brandon Sanderson Stormlight Interview](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1044#1)

A couple of weeks back our good friends at Gollancz got in contact and asked if we’d like to interview one of our favourite authors, Brandon Sanderson. Of course, we said 'YES!', but because Brandon is busy we knew we’d only have a very limited amount of questions we’d be able to ask, so we wanted to invite the community to help us choose them. The only rules were that we wanted questions to revolve around The Stormlight Archive and, I have to say, you guys from our Forums and Reddit.com (where I asked for help coming up with questions) came through and then some: so, thank you so, so much :)
The following answers from Brandon have been transcribed, enjoy!
