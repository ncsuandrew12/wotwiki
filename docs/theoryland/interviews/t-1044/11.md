# [Interview #1044: Fantasy Faction Interview: Brandon Sanderson Stormlight Interview, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1044#11)

#### Question

Is Hoid drawn to novel-worthy plots? Or does he ever just show up in a completely "normal" time/place, with no ramifications on the cosmere, shards, etc.?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is drawn to places specifically because of what's happening in those worlds. He is there and he is meddling.
