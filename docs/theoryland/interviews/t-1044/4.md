#### Question

Is there a big difference in this for The Stormlight Archive versus projects like
*Steelheart*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, in that the more streamlined the story, the easier the revisions tend to be. Because the more complicated the story, the higher number of viewpoints, the more you have to worry about continuity and about the characters, how what they do influences the timeline of other characters. In something like The Stormlight Archive, there is a lot more continuity involved, and that makes the revisions a lot harder.
