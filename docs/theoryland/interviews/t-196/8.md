# [Interview #196, Entry #8]: DragonCon Report - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#8)

#### Isabel

Well, those were the signing questions and answers of mine. After that I was on a
*New Spring*
panel. That was fun. But after that I ran to the Reading session. Fortunately I could get on the front row and save a few spots for fellow Theorylanders (who would be arriving late).

#### Robert Jordan

He did a reading. He didn't read the prologue as everyone thought he would be, but he did another chapter. I am not allowed to say anything about it. Copyright issues. And no other Theorylander will say anything about it!!! Yeah, sorry RAFO. Think of it as a room full of people have been giving a advanced copy of a chapter or a part of the chapter.

#### Isabel

After the reading he had a lot of time left for questions and answer session. I jumped up first of course. And he started telling everyone again that I managed to sneak out without telling my mom and that I was 12, hehe, so I think people did notice me.
