# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#23)

#### Ted Herman

How was Nynaeve able to channel Fire at Rahvin while she was asleep? When Nynaeve & Moghedien battle Rahvin, she channeled fire at him. But according to Moiraine you can only channel Spirit when you are asleep. (
*The Fires of Heaven*
Chapter 55)

#### Robert Jordan

In
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
you can channel everything. Even though she's asleep. If she was not in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, and she's asleep, Spirit is the only thing she would be able to channel or hold on to. But having stepped into
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, in Tel'aran'rhiod, she is able to channel. Her body is still back in...would only be able to maintain Spirit, nothing more. (Adjusted this answer to its verbatim from audio file -Matt).

#### Footnote

Matt: This was the previously paraphrased answer: In Tel'aran'rhiod you can channel Fire. You can channel Spirit only from your sleeping body, but being in Tel'aran'rhiod is different and you can channel anything.
