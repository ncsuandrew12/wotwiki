# [Interview #196, Entry #1]: DragonCon Report - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#1)

#### Isabel

Notes: First of all, my English sucks. WSB has been checking some of the answers and they are correct now. My comments will still suck.

Second: I have been typing this in the late evening. I stopped before one and now it's six and I have started writing this again. With some questions I haven't put down the full question and answer and some are still left out. Because I am busy and not fully interested in the answer to every question asked. Perhaps the full report will be next week. \*\*WSB helped the next day and we fixed it.\*\*

Third: For joining the Official Nynaeve Fanclub you don't have to do anything else than send me the name under which you want to be listed on the list. Email to isabelsedaiSPAM@hotmail.com (remove the spam part of course).

Fourth: I managed to recruit 16 new members so far. I am going to keep trying to get more members. The other Amyrlin of the fanclub should be so proud of me.
