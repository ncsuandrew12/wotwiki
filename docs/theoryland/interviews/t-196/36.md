# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#36)

#### Question

A question about the Forsaken. It is said they have varying levels of strength in the One Power. Do you know where they rank?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Question

I get the impression that Asmodean is weaker than Lanfear even before he was shielded. How much weaker, etc.?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO. I don't go into that kind of thing. I know where they are. I also know they are highly unreliable. None of them is going to admit that anyone is that much stronger than they are. Even when you are inside their heads. Don't take everything they say as the absolute truth or unbiased observation.
