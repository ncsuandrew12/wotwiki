#### Question

Now that you've finished
*Knife of Dreams*
, how many more books will there be?

#### Robert Jordan

I have said it before and will say it again. There will be one more book. Even if it has to be a 1500 page book. It will be the last book even if you have to use a luggage cart to move it (laughter and applause).
