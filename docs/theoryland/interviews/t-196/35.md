#### Question

About
*New Spring*
, I had a question about Lan. About the battle with the Aiel. How do they recognize him? I guess I am more curious about the background, how they recognize him and what they know of him and his back story?

#### Robert Jordan

They know quite a bit about his back story. They think he is a man who has much
*ji*
. He has a one man war against something he cannot beat. And they recognized him by the crescents on his helmet.
