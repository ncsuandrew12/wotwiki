#### Question

Do you have more hope that the movie is going to be made and is the movie going to be a miniseries or a movie?

#### Robert Jordan

Actually, I have to tell you, I don't really care. It would be nice, but if it doesn't happen...it doesn't happen. I am not a moviemaker. I write books. I will just write more books.
