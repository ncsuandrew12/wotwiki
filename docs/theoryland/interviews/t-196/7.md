# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#7)

#### Isabel

Then I couldn't hear any other questions and I went back in line. I could only ask him one question. It's a discussion we had on Theoryland a while ago. Can the
*a'dam*
hold every
*sul'dam*
?

(He managed to get my question after a few times repeating it. I'll leave that out). Frenzy, you were right. (I hope I remember your stand on this issue correctly.)

#### Robert Jordan

The
*a'dam*
can only hold
*sul'dam*
who have been
*sul'dam*
for a long time and so wearing the bracelet for a long time. Four months for example isn't enough. He said the circle helped them get to the point that's described in the book, as being on the brink of being able to channel, one foot stepped over or something. (Quotemasters, please find that quote for me.)
