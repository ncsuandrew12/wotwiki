# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#31)

#### Question

In
*The Great Hunt*
when Rand, Mat and Perrin are trying to enter the Ways,
*Machin Shin*
is waiting there for them. It seems like Padan Fain has been waiting there for them. Is
*Machin Shin*
in any way related to the evil of Shadar Logoth?

#### Robert Jordan

In some ways.
*Machin Shin*
is linked or you might say drawn to that. It's not a matter of linked, but more attracted by. In much the same ways as I spoke about the evils being attracted to one another due to opposite polarities. (Shadar Logoth and the taint)

In the same way there is an attraction because
*Machin Shin*
was created in effect by the taint. It grew out. You can see is at a fungus that was constructed with the wrong type of materials. If you think about it as that way you get a more idea about its true nature.
