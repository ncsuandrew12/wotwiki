# [Interview #196, Entry #9]: DragonCon Report - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#9)

#### Isabel

Anyway, my first question was: In book 10 Elayne mentioned that Galad fancied Nynaeve or had for a time. Did I miss something?

(I put his answer on tape, will type out his words, it will be as close to it as I can get it. Although my tape recorder doesn't pick out everything and I am not going to listen to something 10 times to find his exact exact words. But it is really close.)

#### Robert Jordan

First he had to repeat the question: In the tenth book there was a thought that Galad fancied Nynaeve. I thought by Elayne.

#### Isabel

Yeah. Yeah, and eh it's hard to keep up exactly with who thought what and when.

#### Robert Jordan

Galad did have a certain interest in Nynaeve early on. As sometimes happens that interest has shifted. He is obviously not attracted to Nynaeve any more.

#### Isabel

When did he have the attraction?

#### Robert Jordan

In the beginning when he goes to Nynaeve room. At that time he was interested in her. And Elayne still thinks he is...

#### Isabel

But at that time he was interested in Egwene, I thought.

#### Robert Jordan

No not yet. Not at that time.

#### Isabel

(Probably staring at him in amazement.)

#### Robert Jordan

No not yet.
