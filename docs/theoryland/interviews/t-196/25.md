# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#25)

#### Question

You say one more main sequence book after
*Knife of Dreams*
, but will there be any more?

#### Robert Jordan

I intend to do two prequels; one is why Tam al'Thor gave up a successful military career and went home to buy a small farm in the Two Rivers. And the other one will be largely why and how Moiraine and Lan showed up in the nick of time in
*The Eye of the World*
. When I will do those two novels, I do not know.
