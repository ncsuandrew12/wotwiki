#### Question

A question about if Jordan has been approached by movie makers and directors, etc., and if he sat down with them.

#### Robert Jordan

There is a company called Red Eagle that has the options for
*The Eye of the World*
to make the movie. I am waiting to see the outline from the screenwriters. Hmm, which is in effect telling me what of the book they want to keep and what they want to leave out of the book. Since you are not going to get the whole book into movie.

But if it's actually going to be made, even now I can't say. Some years ago NBC optioned
*The Eye of the World*
to make a six hour mini-series. Less than two years after we had signed the contracts, they came with the screenwriter, who did the miniseries 'Merlin'. Then two years after the contracts were signed, all the people who brought the project together had left NBC.
