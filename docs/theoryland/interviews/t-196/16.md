# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#16)

#### Question

Do certain races have better ability at channeling than others? For example, the Sea Folk at very good at weather, the Aiel have a high proportion of Dreamers and the Seanchan can make
*ter'angreal*
.

#### Robert Jordan

The Seanchan can only make one kind of
*ter'angreal*
. They haven't thought about making another. Certain groups are better at some abilities but it's a matter of need. The Atha'an Miere are dependent on the sea, the wind and water, and it would be natural for them to develop high skills to deal with control of weather and winds. For the Aiel, Dreaming is one of the ways to find new water, using need is how they find water. When the population in a hold is too great, and they have to find a new hold, the Dreamwalker uses need to find it. So yes, there are more Dreamwalkers there.
