#### Question

Can you shield someone who is in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
by shielding their sleeping body?

#### Robert Jordan

If you are injured in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
it will be transferred to your body, but not vice versa.
Shielding someone in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
will shield the body, but shielding the body is not transferred to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. They can channel in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, but of course when they come out, they are shielded.
