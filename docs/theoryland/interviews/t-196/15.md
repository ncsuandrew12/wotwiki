#### Question

Do Seanchan Ogier have the Longing?

#### Robert Jordan

The Longing is a effect of being separated from the
*stedding*
for a long time during the Breaking. At the parts that later became the Seanchan empire, there were many more
*stedding*
(through chance). So they were not separated from the
*stedding*
for so long.

#### Question

So will there ever be a confrontation between the Seanchan Ogier and the other Ogier?

#### Robert Jordan

They will meet... (in other words RAFO)
