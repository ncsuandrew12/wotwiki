#### Question

Question about his writing routine. Do you write the same amount each day?

#### Robert Jordan

He has breakfast, reads the newspaper, goes to his desk. I look at the emails I have to deal with. I cannot say go to hell. Deal with the phone calls that have the same ranking. I am supposed to stop for lunch. I generally remember I have to stop for lunch about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I don't often eat lunch. Then I go help Harriet to get dinner on the table. I do that pretty much seven days a week. I don't mind if I go fishing on a Wednesday or play golf. Last year I believe I played golf once and went fishing three times.
