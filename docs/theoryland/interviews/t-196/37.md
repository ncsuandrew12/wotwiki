# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#37)

#### Zaela Sedai

Are Min's visions about the past or the future?

#### Robert Jordan

They are about the future.

#### Isabel

I wanted to ask how Min saw blood in Taim's future and his past but they cut me off (I guess there was no time and we already had gotten in many questions). Everyone laughing when I tried to sneak in the follow-up question.
