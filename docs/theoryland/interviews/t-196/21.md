#### Zaela Sedai

Did Taim have motives for coming to Andor after he escaped the Aes Sedai?

#### Robert Jordan

Ta-eem (he said it phonetically). [Don't know how to write down how to say it, but it's not how most people say it.] Sure, he is a man who can channel. The Aes Sedai see him as a man who can channel. They will hunt him down and gentle him if they can. He has one safe haven in the world. A place were there are more men like him. Just maybe, if there are enough men like him, the Aes Sedai won't be able to come after him.

#### Isabel

(Sorry Sodas, but at least he didn't complete wipe out YOUR theory.)
