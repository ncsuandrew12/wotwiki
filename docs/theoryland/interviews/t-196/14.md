# [Interview #196: DragonCon Report - Isabel, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=196#14)

#### Isabel

A question from me again (sometimes me with my horrible accent has to repeat the question a few times, for him to get it). Although if I remember correctly it was Aan'allein's question.

How did Aginor manage to sense the Shadar Logoth dagger in the
*The Eye of the World*
?

#### Robert Jordan

That has to do with the end of
*Winter's Heart*
. How many of you have read it?

(everyone but one raising their hands; well at least after asking who has not read it)

It's an effect of resonance. The dagger is the same evil as the evil of Shadar Logoth. You can say it's diametrically opposite to the taint, that's the evil on
*saidin*
. Rand, at one point in Shadar Logoth, feels them pulsing with each other. And especially in the wounds on his side. There is a resonance created. A positive and negative pulse of evil, you might say.

#### Isabel

So it doesn't require actual channeling?

#### Robert Jordan

No, but you have to be close to it. It's not something you can sense from a close distance use to track Padan Fain down.
