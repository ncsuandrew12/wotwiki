#### Question

How do the Atha'an Miere and the Amayar deal with male channelers?

#### Robert Jordan

They kill them...actually the Sea Folk kill their male channelers. The Amayar don't channel themselves they see it as a violation of their Water Way and they commit suicide.

#### Question

Are we going to see more of Tremalking in the next book or of their prophecies?

#### Robert Jordan

In a way.
