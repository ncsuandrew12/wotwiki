# [Interview #586, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Interviews, Gemmell Award Nominations, Annotation](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=586#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
are on the long nominees list for the 2010/2011 David Gemmell Legend Award. Last year,
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Warbreaker*
were both voted into the short list and ended up losing the final ballot to
*Empire*
by Graham McNeill. Anyway, there are a lot of worthy books on the list, so go vote for the one book you think deserves the award. You can only vote ONCE, and multiple votes will cause ALL of your votes to be discarded. Round two will be sometime after March.
