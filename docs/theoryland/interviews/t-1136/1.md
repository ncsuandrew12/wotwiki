#### Cadmium

Well, yes. hmm. We... we've seen someone with a hemallurgic spike communicate or under the control of Ruin or Harmony. Can other spikes communi, sorry no people, well Shards... ugh so nervous." (Trying to get it accurate.)
Brandon looks a little confused at me, but smiles.
"Can other \*Shards\* communicate or control those individuals?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Good Question. Yes... \*scribbles\* They can certainly communicate...

#### Question

(I excitedly, but rudely, interrupt a bit) To what extent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

not to the extent that Ruin did. The others could communicate but it'd be vague or faint, not as direct as Ruin was. He connects to us, well, them through the little bit of Preservation that he had or could touch. Because the spike pierces the soul.

#### Question

What about on other planets than Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It'd work the same way. but again probably vaguer or fainter. Might go unnoticed.
