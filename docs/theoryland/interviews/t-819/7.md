# [Interview #819, Entry #7]: JordanCon 2012 - AMOL Update Panel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=819#7)

#### Richard Fife

I really enjoyed the comic books that are being done, the
*Eye of the World*
comic book that's being done right now. I know Maria's working on that quite a bit, and Alan. You wanna talk about that a little bit, about how that's going for you?

#### Maria Simons

Actually, we are getting close to the end of
*The Eye of the World*
, and it's going well. We haven't talked at all about
*The Great Hunt*
, but I'm hoping that we'll start. We've got one more script to go for
*The Eye of the World*
, and then hopefully we will be moving on, and the next graphic novel will be out in the fall, part two of
*The Eye of the World*
, and it's a lot of fun doing that, and I hope you'll all check it out.

#### Alan Romanczuk

It's put us in awe, also, of the amount of work that goes into creating a graphic novel. A great deal on our part, looking stuff over for approval, but what's happening in the graphic shop, and it's not unusual at all to get emails at 10pm Friday night, or midnight Saturday night, you know, "Here's the latest stuff from us." You know, when do you guys sleep? Any of you who are graphic artists out there, I guess you know what it's like. It's total geekdom. You don't think about eating, sleeping...you just do it. And the amount of change that has to go on in every single panel is pretty awesome.
