#### Question

I was just wondering if we have a rough idea of how long the next book's gonna be, how many pages (hardcover).

#### Harriet McDougal

Not really. I could tell you, and the reason is that the number...I've worked out the number of pages because the computer tells me, and as Brandon sends us parts, and I've added them all together with a pencil. But this is in 12-point type, and it includes a lot of editorial back-and-forth, so it's looking fat. But it's skinnier than it looks. And there are some sections Brandon and I are having—well, even one I don't think he's seen yet—animated conversations about cutting. Well see, I really hesitate very deeply to say because 12-point type is a
*lot*
bigger than 10-point, and then you have to adjust from manuscript page to printed and on and on...I think probably at least eight hundred.

#### Maria Simons

It's gonna be fat.

#### Harriet McDougal

It will at least be pleasingly plump. (laughter).

#### Melissa Craib

Just big-boned.

#### Alan Romanczuk

And it'll look great on the bookshelf.

#### Melissa Craib

Absolutely, very impressive!
