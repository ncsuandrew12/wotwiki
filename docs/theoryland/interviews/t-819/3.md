#### Jeremy Vanneman

I noticed you said (in the
[prologue excerpt](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/04/a-memory-of-light-prologue-excerpt)
) that 'he' is the one that caused this, and I never actively noticed that the Dark One had never really had a gender before now. Is this referencing the Dark One or someone else?

#### Harriet McDougal

That's Bayrd's idea.
