# [Interview #819: JordanCon 2012 - AMOL Update Panel, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=819#5)

#### Question

I was just interested in whether there were any plans for any further prequels or other parts of the Wheel of Time?

#### Harriet McDougal

No. Excuse me, there will be an encyclopedia of the Wheel of Time, but that's the only other book that's planned.

#### Question

As a continuance, will you be willing to license it out to people who you feel are worthy to do it?

#### Harriet McDougal

No. My husband was very strong that he would rise from the grave in
*wrath*
if that happened. He really,
*really*
didn't want it.

#### Melissa Craib

No zombie Jordan!
