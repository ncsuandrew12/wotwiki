# [Interview #746: Interview: Brandon Sanderson on (primarily) The Alloy of Law and narrator Michael Kramer, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=746#7)

Something which just occurred to me was that, other than editors, advance reviewers, etc. the first people who will get their hands on the conclusion to The Wheel of Time will be the audiobook narrators—including Kramer, who has been a constant voice in the series. You've written that the final words in the series are Robert Jordan's—can you give away whether the final voice on the audiobook might be Kramer's?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha! I can't give you something like that. I'm sorry. Nice try, though.
