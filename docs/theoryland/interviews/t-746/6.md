# [Interview #746, Entry #6]: Interview: Brandon Sanderson on (primarily) The Alloy of Law and narrator Michael Kramer](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=746#6)

#### Samuel Montgomery-Blinn

What are your favorite audiobooks? (Or: do you listen to audiobooks?)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I listen to audiobooks on occasion, when I'm driving somewhere. The thing is, I don't drive much anymore, because I work from home. I do enjoy audiobooks, but I like to listen to them when I'm doing something else. I really enjoyed the Harry Potter audiobooksâ€”I thought those were very good. I like Michael Kramer and Kate Reading's interpretation of the Wheel of Time. But I am not as much an audiobook junkie as some people would be, because I don't go anywhere. Most people I've known who listen to a lot of audiobooks like to do it while they're commuting or something like that.
