Today I'm absolutely ecstatic to post my interview with bestselling author Brandon Sanderson:

I first met and spoke to Sanderson in September 2010, when he came to Raleigh's Quail Ridge Books for a reading and signing event for
[*The Way of Kings*
: Book One of The Stormlight Archive](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B003ZWFO7E&qid=1332513996&sr=1-1)
, and one of the topics we got onto happened to be audiobooks. Fast forward to the fall of 2011 and the release of
[*The Alloy of Law: A Mistborn Novel*](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_3?asin=B005ZUI3OA&qid=1332460857&sr=1-3)
(which I reviewed
[here](http://audiblesff.tumblr.com/post/16201760140/review-the-alloy-of-law-by-brandon-sanderson)
on the Audible SF/F blog) and it felt like it was time to dig a little deeper on the subject of audiobooks, narrator
[Michael Kramer](http://www.audible.com/search/ref=sr_1_1_nsrch_s?searchNarrator=Michael+Kramer&qid=1332460857&sr=1-1)
, and (maybe) see about poking around on the ending to the
[Wheel of Time](http://www.audible.com/series/ref=sr_1_5_sa/?asin=B005NB81EI)
, due out in January 2013.
