#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 10)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-ten/)

There was an epic battle with my editor over some revision changes to this chapter. I though that the word to use for a place where someone stands to address a crowd was a "podium." He said that was an adulteration of the language, and that the pure, classical word to use was "lectern."

He won.
