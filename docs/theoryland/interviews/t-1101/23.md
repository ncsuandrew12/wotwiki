# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#23)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 7)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-seven/)

Here's where we start to get some of our first real hints of the dominating plotline that will overshadow these two books: The Lord Ruler is dead. What in the world have we gotten ourselves into?

As I mentioned in the previous Sazed annotation, I really like his scenes for the conflict represented in them. He is a rebel, but he feels so bad for it. It's always nice when you can make a character feel some very real turmoil for doing the RIGHT thing.

We will go a lot more into Sazed's character, and how he is regarded by the other Terrismen, in future chapters.
