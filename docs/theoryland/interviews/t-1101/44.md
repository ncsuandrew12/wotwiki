#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 15)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-fifteen/)

This is the first twinge of distrust between Vin and Elend. She doesn't tell him about seeing the Mist Spirit again.

It's a small thing, I admit, but for me—as a writer—it was intended as a dangerous first step. Vin's ability to trust is still fragile. And, if she thinks that Elend will mock her or disregard her, she'd rather keep it in.
