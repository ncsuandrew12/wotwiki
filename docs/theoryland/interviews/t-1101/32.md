# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#32)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 11)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-eleven/)

A few things to watch out for. There might be an extra "Silver" or "Silvereye" stuck in the books somewhere.

If you read the annotations in the last book, you'll know that I changed the Allomantic metal of silver into tin at the last minute. I couldn't find a good alloy of silver, and though I liked "Silvereye" as a word much better than "Tineye" I decided to go with the choice that was more logical for worldbuilding, rather than the one that sounded better.

There could still be a spare silver or two hanging around in this book, since it was written before I made the swap. (I just found one in Book Three and got it changed right in time.)
