#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 2)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-two/)

Allomantic fights are fun.

I'll admit it. I LIKE to write things that are fun. I'm an entertainer—and that is what my stories try to do. I think there's great value in that.

That said, I think this might be my least favorite fight in the book. You may remember that I said the same thing about the first battle in book one (that's the fight where Kelsier takes on the Hazekillers in Keep Venture.) Getting the mechanics of Allomancy down, showing things step by step, takes longer, and lacks a bit of finesse. I hope this fight was still enjoyable, but it was far too step-by-step to be really great, in my opinion.

The fights I really like are the ones where there is a beauty—a sense of grace and poetry—to the fight itself. The one at Keep Hasting later in this book is a much better example off that.
