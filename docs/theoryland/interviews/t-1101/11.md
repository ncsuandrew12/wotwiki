#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 3)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-three/)

Well, there you go. That chapter (with a big chunk of two) was originally the first chapter of the book. Oddly, moving it back made the book move more quickly, for me at least. It's strange how you can sometimes speed up a novel by ADDING material.

Speed in books, however, has little to do with how long the book actually is, and everything to do with how captivated the reader is.
