# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#26)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 8)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-eight/)

So, Moshe and I BOTH worried about the fact that we've got two shadow mysterious figures showing up at the beginning of this book. Part of the problem is the rewrite, which mashed things together at the beginning of the novel, increasing the speed—but then melding things together as well. Originally, the mist spirit showed up before the Watcher. Now they both are introduced in the same chapter, which happens to be the second chapter.

That makes me worry about overlap and confusion, but we decided there was nothing to be done about it. As the story progresses, hopefully they'll be differentiated enough in the reader's head to keep them straight. (It doesn't help that I have creatures in this world known as mistwraiths, which are different from either the Watcher or the mist spirit. Sigh.)
