# [Interview #1101, Entry #61]: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#61)

#### Brandon Sanderson

We get to see a bit of depth from both Breeze and Tindwyl in this chapter. As I said earlier, I can't really spend the time to round out everyone on the crew, so I have to pick carefully. Breeze is one of my favorites, so I decided to work a bit with him in this book. As you'll find out later in the book (when we get a few Breeze viewpoints) he's actually a full-blooded nobleman. It's not really that important to the story; it's just part of who he is.

Breeze has made a life and a reputation out of hiding his feelings behind his attitude. He likes looking like a scoundrelâ€”not only does it let him get away with a lot of random things, but it also keeps people from poking too far into his past. There are a lot of skaa thieves who would react very poorly if they discovered that Breeze wasn't really one of them, but a nobleman who was forced to seek refuge in the underground.
