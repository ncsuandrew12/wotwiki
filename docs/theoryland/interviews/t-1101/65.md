# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#65)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is a short scene, but one of the more important ones to show off a little character development in Elend. He is beginning to see some of the truth in Tindwyl's words.

Pulling off a transformation like his was one of the great challenges of this book. Actually, the plot was pretty easy—but getting Elend and Vin's relationship down, along with the development of both of their characters, was much more difficult. It takes a subtle hand to make Elend learn to be a king without having him progress too quickly, and I'm not sure how well I did it.

Vin's development—showing off her inner distrust without making her seem paranoid or making their relationship seem shallow—was even tougher.
