# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#2)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Acknowledgements)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-acknowledgements-page/)

There's not a whole lot to say here. A lot of people are returning time and time again as alpha readers. They should get awards or something.

I decided to expand a bit and give some different kinds of acknowledgments this time around. The more I learn about the book industry, the more I realize how many people it takes in order to create the product you now hold. People like Yoder, Dot Lin, and the bookstore sales forces are all part of the "Brandon Sanderson" name, in a way. It's kind of like Brandon Sanderson is, in part, a pen name for the hundreds of people who collectively create a novel.
