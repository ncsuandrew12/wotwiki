# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#21)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 6)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-six/)

So, here's a little of the jovial friendship that I mentioned in the last annotation. One of the things I like about these books IS the way that the characters can get along and relax. It's a bit tougher to pull off in this book—with Kelsier gone, and with everything falling apart—but it's still there, where I can squeeze it in.

Spook is a character I groomed through the first book to do more than you might originally expected from him. He doesn't really come to his own for some time yet, but you should be able to see changes start to appear in him—subtly, of course. You'll see a lot more from him later on in the series.
