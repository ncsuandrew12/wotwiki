Here we get the return of Breeze, a perennial favorite of the Mistborn world. He gets far more screen time—and depth of characterization—than Ham, Clubs, or Dockson do. You just can't develop everyone. (Especially if you're not George R. R. Martin.) I did my best with the side characters, and Breeze and Spook turned out the best, in my opinion. You'll see more of both of them, and learn more about them, as the series moves along.

I love this rescue scene, and I got to use the "Vin splits and arrow with its own arrowhead" scene, which was one of the coolest moments in Mistborn Prime. (Long story. Read the Mistborn 1 annotations.) There's a certain arrogant flare to this scene, and it ends up working quite well, I think.
