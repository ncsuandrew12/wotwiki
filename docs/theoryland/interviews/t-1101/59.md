# [Interview #1101, Entry #59]: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#59)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 20)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-2-chapter-twenty/)

Elend is already progressing nicely as a king. There's a lot more time passing in here than I'm showing—lots of training and lessons. One of my worries is that Elend will develop too quickly. However, considering the situation he's in, I suspect that he knows he has to either adapt quickly or be destroyed. A few tense months can really change a person a lot.
