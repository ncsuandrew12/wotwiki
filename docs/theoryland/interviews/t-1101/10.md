# [Interview #1101, Entry #10]: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#10)

Also, thanks to my writing group for the Soundsticks suggestion. They probably don't remember it—it's been years since one of them suggested it (I think Nate H. was the one who actually said it) and I thought it was a great idea. This is a perfect way to deal with a Mistborn—they're going to have enhanced senses, so you play off of that and make them pay. I love this, since I talk so much about balance and use of force in Allomancy. Actions and reactions. I wanted this magic to feel very Newtonian.
