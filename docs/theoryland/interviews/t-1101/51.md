# [Interview #1101, Entry #51]: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#51)

This fight is for the Allomancy junkies. I don't think there's another one quite as technical as it is in the entire rest of the series.

I try to give variety to how my fight scenes are handled. The spar between Ham and Vin was quick and visual. This fight is all about pushes, pulls, and weight. I fear that it's pretty hard to imagine, and unless you're really into Allomancy, I suspect that many of you skimmed most of it.

Yet, writing a book is about putting in lots of things for lots of different people, I think. Allomancy is fun because of its versatility—I can to all kinds of things with it. This was just one of them.

So, if you really like how Allomancy works—with the pushes and pulls, the vectors, mass, accleration, and all that, this is a present for you. A chapter really showing off what two Mistborn can do when expertly manipulating their powers.
