# [Interview #1101: Mistborn: The Well of Ascension Annotations, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1101#13)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The second half of this chapter, where Vin and Elend are chatting, is where the book finally starts to feel 'good' to me. I'm mostly past the exposition reminding you of what happened in Book One, and I can get into more 'showing' of character rather than reminding of past events.

I could have, perhaps, done something different with these reminders. I could have told you less, and let you remember on your own. Or, I could have worked the reminders in more delicately. However, the former would have left some people confused, and the later would have taken many more pages. I eventually took the easier, and time-tested, route of reminder exposition. We'll see if people like this or not, but it really did seem like the best way in this novel. (Interestingly, there's a thread about this on my forums right now.)
