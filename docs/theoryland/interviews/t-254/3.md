# [Interview #254: Robert Jordan's Blog: THIS AND THAT, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=254#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For Isabel, and sundry others, my apologies. No, not about twitting Isabel. That's too much fun to apologize for. But the questions she had Sander hand in on the tour really were about Asmodean, not Nynaeve. I don't know why, but for some reason when I think "questions from Isabel," the name "Nynaeve" simply springs into my head. Anybody out there think they have any explanations for this phenomena? It is a puzzlement.

#### Footnote

Isabel was 'Amyrlin' of the Nynaeve Fan Club, which she started when she was about 16 (and RJ always insists that she was 12).
