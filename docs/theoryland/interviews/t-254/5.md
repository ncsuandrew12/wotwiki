For Begona, I'm afraid there aren't any further signings until late June of 2006. And those will be in Anchorage, Alaska and Seattle, Washington. If you send a letter snail-mail to Tor Books, they'll forward it to me, and I'll send you some bookplates—if you want actual books signed, you must include the return shipping container and postage—but that won't get you autographs until February earliest, I'd say.
