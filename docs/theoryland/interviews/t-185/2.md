# [Interview #185: Robert Jordan Talks About the Holidays, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=185#2)

#### Question

Which famous Science Fiction & Fantasy (SFF) figure (writer or character) would you most like to bring to a Christmas party? And which of your own creations would you invite to pull a cracker or two?

#### Robert Jordan

Robert Heinlein and J.R.R. Tolkien. I'd go for Mark Twain and Jane Austen, but you did say SFF. And writers are, one hopes, more fascinating than any of their characters because they contain all of their characters, who might be let out if the wine flows freely. Heinlein and Tolkien were two very interesting and very different men, with a few similarities I believe, and it is the precise mesh of differences and similarities that make for brilliant dinner table conversation. If I could have a third, I'd make it John M. Ford. I know exactly what sort of dinner companion Mike is, and his presence at a table with Heinlein and Tolkien would guarantee an evening of marvelous conversation. Between the three of them, they'd make sure that everybody sparkled, if only by being pulled along in their slipstream.
