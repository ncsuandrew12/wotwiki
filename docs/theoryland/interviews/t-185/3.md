# [Interview #185: Robert Jordan Talks About the Holidays, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=185#3)

#### Question

And what SFF movie would you all collapse in front of after the [Holiday] feast?

#### Robert Jordan

Not one, I fear.
*The Fellowship of the Ring*
and
*The Two Towers*
, back to back, in the expanded versions. Pull an all-nighter over brandy and cigars. Mr. Heinlein would be fascinated by the special effects and how they were done, as well as by the story, of course. Mr. Tolkien could grumble about what the movies had done to his books. I've never known a writer who didn't enjoy grumbling, at least in private, about what the movies had done to his book. And Mike and I could just enjoy. Maybe we'd toss in
*Pirates of the Caribbean*
and make it a true all-nighter. I went to a charity Halloween ball as Captain Black Jack Sparrow (hair beads by Elise Mattheson), and I am told the resemblance between me and Johnny Depp was amazing. Especially around the eyes. The eyes took two women half an hour to get done!
