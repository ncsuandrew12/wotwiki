The most recent Writing Excuses episode features David Brin talking with Dan and Mary at the World Fantasy convention about
[the importance of criticism](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/03/04/)
.

The Hugo Awards nomination deadline is the end of this week. If you're already a member of the 2011, 2012, or 2013 Worldcons, be sure to get your
[nomination form](https://chicon.org/hugo/nominate.php)
submitted. I talked about this
[two months ago](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1046/)
, but I and my Writing Excuses partners have various works that are eligible, particularly
[Writing Excuses Season Six](http://www.aist-nara.ac.jp/~mbarker/writingexcuses/IndexSeasonSix.htm)
in the Best Related Work category.

There's a new
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
annotation up. This one covers
[chapter three](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/447/Alcatraz-Chapter-Three)
