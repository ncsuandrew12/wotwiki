#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow. I've got a lot to post today. Guess that's what I get for not blogging for four days.

First, a
[new Podcast is up over at Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
. And, speaking of podcasts,
[I did an interview with Adventures in Sci Fi](http://www.adventuresinscifipublishing.com/)
, which you can hear on their website.

LTUE was fun; much thanks to everyone who came to see me and who got their books signed. Over the weekend, we also got initial cover art for the new
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
paperback which is coming out in June. Click on it to get a
[much larger version](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/graphics/mistbornpbnew.jpg)
. And, if that weren't enough,
[Mistborn 3 just went up on Amazon for pre-order](http://www.amazon.com/HERO-AGES-Mistborn-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0765316897/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203364445&sr=8-1)
! What a busy weekend.
