# [Interview #116: Letter to Paul Ward, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=116#7)

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: How did the Hundred Companions link to make the seals on the Dark One's prison?

#### Robert Jordan

They did not do it linked. They worked together individually, which made it more difficult, and that is part of the reason the seals have weakened so quickly. I never meant to imply linking. It is possible for large numbers to do a large project without linking, although it is more easily done in a circle.
