# [Interview #116: Letter to Paul Ward, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=116#5)

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: What's up with the Accepted test
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Anyone being tested is merely a visitor, or rider, on whoever she is in [another reality.]

#### Paul Ward

Therefore, though Sharina may be a real person, it doesn't mean anything in terms of her future advising to the Malkier throne.

#### Addendum

The full text of the response from RJ was

#### Robert Jordan

The places that novices visit while testing for Accepted are other realities, but it's not quite that simple. Anyone being tested is merely a visitor, or rider, on whoever she is in that world. Some of those who have not come back have died, and some have become absorbed in the different reality, but that is not to say that they are still alive in any sense that we would recognize. You really don't want to stay in the other reality, no matter how terrific it might seem.

[Verbatim. Everything he said about the Accepted test
*ter'angreal*
