#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

I really think that the best suggestion for the murderer of Asmodean was that it was Moiraine acting under Compulsion imposed by Bela. Of course, that is not the answer, but it is the best suggestion from a fan.

#### Paul Ward

I can't remember who suggested that. It's the
*best*
suggestion?
