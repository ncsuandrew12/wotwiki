# [Interview #116, Entry #9]: Letter to Paul Ward](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=116#9)

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Is the Dark One pure True Power? Why does the Creator ignore Randland except to talk to Rand at the end of
*The Eye of the World*
?

#### Robert Jordan

No, the Dark One is not pure True Power. Who says the Creator takes little interest in the activities of mankind? And I will neither confirm nor deny that the Creator spoke to Rand.

#### Paul Ward

Neither confirm nor deny? What's up with that?
