#### Paul Ward

Possible questions: Does balefire affect itself? Can you balefire balefire? If you balefire another person, but then you get balefired, what happens to the person you balefired?

#### Robert Jordan

The balefire weave exists wholly or partly outside time, which removes it from its own effect.

#### Paul Ward

This would have been helpful back during the balefire physics debates.
