# [Interview #116: Letter to Paul Ward, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=116#4)

#### Paul Ward

Possible question: Why did the
*ter'angreal*
doorway burn down when Lanfear and Moiraine passed through?

#### Robert Jordan

When Moiraine and Lanfear went through the
*ter'angreal*
, it burned in part because both were channeling, and the world on the other side of the doorway has a radically different set of natural laws. The odd optical effects witnessed in that other world are not artificially produced artifacts. (complete answer)

#### Paul Ward

The laws for channeling are different on the other side of the doorway...interesting.
