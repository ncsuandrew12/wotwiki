# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#65)

#### Question

In
*The Way of Kings*
, is Assassination a common thing in the Parshendi culture, because it seems odd that they would have a specific custom for what assassins wear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is something that happened quite a bit more in the past than it does now. But yes, you will find out much more about them. They are now more unified, but they used to be a bunch of different tribes, and they would send assassins into each other's camps.
