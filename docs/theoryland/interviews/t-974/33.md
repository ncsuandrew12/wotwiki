# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#33)

#### Question

How come Lan couldnâ€™t tell that Moiraine was alive, and with the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn? Because he felt the severing of the bond?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He did not have the bond any more. Since the bond was severed, he couldn't feel her any more.

#### Question

But why would the bond be severed, she was still alive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RJ says it is because she went to another dimension, and when that slice happened, it cut the bond. The bond couldn't function across the dimension there without some sort of connection there, without some sort of opening portal or something like that.
