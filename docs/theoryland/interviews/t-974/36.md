# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#36)

#### Question

So what do you read? You are a writer, what do you read?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I read Terry Pratchett. Whenever I can find a chance to do so, I love his works. And I like to read books by new writers, to see what's going on in the field, and see what people are doing.
