#### Question

Was
*New Spring*
originally a novella that was expanded, or was it planned as a novel that was released in several parts?

#### Harriet McDougal

It started as a novella for the collection called
*Legends*
. And then Tom Doherty said, "Well you can expand that into a novel, that won't take any time at all." I said, "Tom, that's not really a good idea." He didn't listen to me.
