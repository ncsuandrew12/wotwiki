# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #47](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#47)

#### Question

#### Brandon Sanderson

You were the person with the Moiraine question. RJ wrote in his notes that main purpose of Moiraine is to prevent a war between Rand and Egwene. And then she was to go with him into the Pit of Doom, but in the Pit of Doom there was nothing for her to do. And I felt bad about that, but that's what he instructed. It was hard to come up with stuff for everyone to have a part and a role. But I did what he instructed. It was a good question, people wondered. She did have an important role to play.
