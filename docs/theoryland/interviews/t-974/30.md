# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#30)

#### Question

Who started the book signing war between you and Patrick Rothfuss?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The fans. They're the one who asked him to write something. Then they asked me to write something, so last night someone asked me to write something else back to him, so I wrote, "Pat Rothfuss is a very classy dude".
