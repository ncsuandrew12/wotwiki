# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#28)

#### Question

Why did you have to kill Vin and Elend?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They demanded that they be allowed to take the chance they did. And I just let them take the chance. I didn't kill them, I just let them take the chance that they demanded that I let them take. That's kind of a cop-out answer, I'm sorry, but that's what it feels like to me. And if I always make it so that there are no consequences, then the books have no heart.
