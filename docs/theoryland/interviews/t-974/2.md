# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#2)

#### Question

There are 32,000 plus pages of notes/documentation from Robert Jordan. Will that ever see the light of day?

#### Harriet McDougal

Some of it will appear in the Encyclopedia. Team Jordan figures another 10-12 months work to complete the initial work. Then probably a year for Tor to commission the illustrations and produce the book.
