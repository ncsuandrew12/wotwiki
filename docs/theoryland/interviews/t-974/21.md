#### Question

How hard was it for you to separate the fan from the writer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This was something I'd never had to do before, and it was somewhat hard at the beginning. Basically, I wanted to stay away from letting the fan control too much, because you couldn't have that. Otherwise Narg would do a cameo every other chapter and things like that. And yet, you know, I am a fan and I can't separate completely the fact there are things I wanted to see. I wanted to see a reunion between Rand and Tam. There are things that I wanted these last books to provide, and I had to listen to the fan when working on the outline and saying, "Is there an opportunity for this?, what did he instruct me to do?, what places are there things that I know as a fan I wanted for years?, and which ones are appropriate to put in?" And so I didn't completely separate, but it was something that I had to be aware of.
