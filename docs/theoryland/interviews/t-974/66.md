#### Question

What happened to the Tinkers? Why didn't you give them the Song?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't because in his notes Robert Jordan said, and I quote, "The Tinkers never do find their damn song." He wrote it exactly like that. And it's because the song has become something more than just a song. It is a way of life. It means peace, kind of Nirvana. And it's actually basically impossible to find the song, because it means the whole world is at peace. Thatâ€™s what it means to them now. And because it's become an ideal rather than a single event, it's not something you could actually even go to them with the thing that was originally the Song and sing, and have them acknowledge that it is the Song.
