# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#44)

#### Question

Will you be finishing the Alcatraz series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will soon be finishing the series. I had to buy the rights back. I didn't like how the publisher was treating the series. I got the rights back on January 1st. It's been a bit of a break, but I will finish it.
