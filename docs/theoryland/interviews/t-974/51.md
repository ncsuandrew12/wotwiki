# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #51](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#51)

#### Question

Dalinar and Lan, who wins in a swordfight? Both full Shardbearers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both full Shardbearers. Lan probably wins, I would guess. Lan is more pure swordsman than Dalinar. Dalinar spent a lot of time on things like battlefield tactics.
