# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #79](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#79)

#### Question

From Freelancer again. Moiraine promised Thom to tell the names of the Red Aes Sedai (who gentled) Owyn. Does she ever do that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It's not onscreen but it does happen.

#### Question

And is there anybody in that list that we would be interested in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually asked that question to Maria, and Maria said no.

#### Question

OK.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Really what I said is, "Do we want to do this, is this relevant?" She said, "No I don't think this is relevant, and it's not worth jumping through hoops."

#### Question

OK.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because there is nothing there that's going to, yeah.

That was what came of it. Now whether that actually means, is there any name you'd recognize, you might recognize a name, but it wasn't relevant enough to jump through storytelling hoops to get that on screen, to bother with it.
