#### Question

Do you ever see yourself creating a series of books of this level?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know that I see anyone ever creating another series of books on this level, what he did. But I do have lots of stories that I want to tell, and I can hope.

#### Harriet McDougal

And I would recommend that you pay attention to a book of Brandon's called
*The Way of Kings*
.
