# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#13)

#### Question

Do you have any advice for up and coming authors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have a lot of it. The number one piece though is just to keep at it and practice. However, if you want a lot of advice, I've got two resources for you. I do a podcast called
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
. And I have all of my University lectures posted online at a website called
[Write about Dragons](http://writeaboutdragons.com/)
. One of my grad students recorded them and put them all up. If you've already seen those, then you already have all of my advice. Why are you asking? Keep at it, just keep at it. BICHOK: Butt in chair, hands on keyboard.
