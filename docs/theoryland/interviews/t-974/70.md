# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #70](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#70)

#### Question

I was told that Talmanes was initially introduced as Mat's foil character, just for that purpose. Is that true?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know for sure, but I would bet it is. Just seeing the way that Robert Jordan used things like that. I would bet so.
