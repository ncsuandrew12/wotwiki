#### J. Dauro

Here are transcripts for all the Q&A from the Birmingham Signing. These are broken into three pieces, The General Q&A with the crowd, the specific questions asked of Brandon at the signing table, and the Memory Keeper private Q&A.

Many of these questions are repeats from other signings. But I wanted to post them all.

This post is part 1.
