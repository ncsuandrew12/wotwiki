# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#10)

#### Question

What about the Mistborn video game?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We put it off until 2014, because of the new console generation. We had planned for it to come out right when the buzz was saying the new consoles were going to launch. And that felt like a bad idea to us. The Mistborn film is also in the works, but it is very early and it is not nearly as far along as the Wheel of Time film is. So if anyone's father is J. J. Abrams, have him call me.
