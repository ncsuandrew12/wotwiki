#### Question

In at least two of the books that I know of, a god is either dead or attacked in some form or fashion. Is there any reason for that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there is an ongoing theme there, and it's primarily because there is an overarching story behind the story. The books are all in the same universe. And there is a character that's the same in all of the books. In
*Way of Kings*
it's Wit. He's actually in all of them.
