# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #76](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#76)

#### Question

Two words that I find very evocative are Dreadbane and Balescream. What's yours?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can usually guess that if it's not Old Tongue, it's probably me.

#### Question

I mean what's your favorite word? What's the word you find most evocative from the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the series. Let me see. Hmm. I've always liked the term Heartstone. I would think. That one is very evocative to me.
