# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#16)

#### Question

(Could you see a) crossover novel with the Wheel of Time and any other fantasy series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Time already crosses over with every fantasy series because the Wheel of Time contains the multiverse philosophy, that all other worlds are shadows of the Wheel of Time world. So they're already there. Otherwise I just wouldn't want to see anything like that happen, it just wouldn't feel right to me. But that's an amusing question, thank you for it.
