# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #80](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#80)

#### Question

Chris Cottingham asked, Is Nakomi's dealing with the soup for Aviendha the same as Rand and the pipe?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What do you mean?

#### Question

Is it the same power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs) No, it is not. I'll go ahead and, wow, you actually managed to get a question out of me about Nakomi. No that is not the same.

#### Footnoteâ€”Terez

(Brandon later
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=874#29)
that he didn't know anything more than the fans do about the pipe.)

#### Question

Is "Nakomi" from the Old Tongue, and is there a translation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll go ahead and RAFO anything else dealing with Nakomi. You did get an answer out of me on one thing, so that's good.

#### Harriet McDougal

Nakomi wandered in from the Song of Hiawatha.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There you go.

#### Question

That's what we thought, yes.
