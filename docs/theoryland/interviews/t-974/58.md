# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#58)

#### Question

What up and coming fantasy writer would you read?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really like Brent Weeks, but you probably already know about Brent. If you haven't read the Lightbringer books, they're wonderful. I like Brian McClellan, who has a new book coming out this year, it's his first. I would suggest that you keep an eye on him.
