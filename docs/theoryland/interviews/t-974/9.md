#### Question

There was a PC Wheel of Time game in the late 90's (of which quality we will not speak). Is there a chance of future video games in the Wheel of Time world?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, those rights are with Manetheren, and I don't know how they are coming along with the development, but it is in development.
