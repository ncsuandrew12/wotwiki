# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#24)

#### Question

Having worked on this project after somebody else, how will this affect your future writing style?

Well, I think I gained a lot of insight, working on this project, and that has changed my writing style. I don't think that necessarily, the work on it normally has, because I, like I said, studied the Wheel of Time, and learned about managing influences early in my career. And yet, working on this, being able to see the things RJ did, and gaining a better admiration of some of the things that he managed to pull off. His level of subtlety and foreshadowing for example, really made me say wow, I can see what he's doing and I can see it even better, and it's challenged me to be a better writer. So, I think, as to be better at working with multiple viewpoints, lots of different characters.
