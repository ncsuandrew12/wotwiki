# [Interview #974: AMOL Signing Report - J. Dauro, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=974#8)

#### Question

If you each could live in any land of the Wheel of Time, what would that land be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say for me, oh it's probably just going to be Andor. Because that's simple and normal and fewer people are trying to kill me there.

#### Harriet McDougal

I think I second the vote.
