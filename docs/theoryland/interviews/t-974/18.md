#### Question

If you have a favorite book from the series, what would it be and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do have a favorite book, one of the nice things is, I can answer as a fan, because I was a fan for many years before I took this over. As the writer you don't answer these sorts of things very easily. But I was part of a lot of the discussions where we argued about the best books, and which characters annoyed us, which characters we loved. My favorite book is book four, because of two specific events, yeah. I really love Rand's trip through the glass columns, I think it's my favorite sequence in the series. But also, the siege of the Two Rivers is one of my favorites. How about you, Harriet?

#### Harriet McDougal

I love the trip through the columns too. I was just blown away by it once again. I said, "Honey, youâ€™ve done it again." But I'm very fond of
*A Memory of Light*
, too.

#### All

Awww.
