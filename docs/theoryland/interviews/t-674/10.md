I too had the [good] fortune to be able to participate in the meeting with the great Robert (thanks again Sergio Fanucci) and I can say that his wife is a gracious distinguished lady of a certain age, that we knew to be an important editor of a major American publishing house and the person who "discovered" RJ's talent: thanks also to you my dear...(mmm I cannot remember his name, maybe Raven).
