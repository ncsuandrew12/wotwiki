# [Interview #674: Rome Signing Report - Raven, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=674#3)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked him where the phonetic choice in the naming of characters, names, places came from, given that they are so "unheard of"; he replied that for some of them he got his inspiration from American "mythology" (...), as with Nynaeve which is the name of a really existed historical figure, while for other ones he created them out of nowhere, trying to keep consistent.
