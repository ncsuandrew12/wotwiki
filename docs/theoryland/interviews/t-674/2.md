# [Interview #674, Entry #2]: Rome Signing Report - Raven](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=674#2)

#### Raven

Today at 18:15 I arrived at the Mondadori bookshop near Fontana di Trevi, Rome (Italy). I asked for directions and I went to the caf√© area while waiting for Jordan's arrival. At exactly 18:30 Mr. Jordan came in, together with his wife, with Sergio Fanucci and Valeria Ciocci [the translator of the Italian version of WoT books, at least until the 5th book]; the evening started after a few minutes.

First of all, Sergio Fanucci gave an introduction both "pro domo sua" and for Jordan's sake; afterwards, Jordan himself answered the questions of the (few...) fans which were there, while the priceless Valeria translated.

Many questions were asked; out of the ones I remember, I will especially quote mine.
