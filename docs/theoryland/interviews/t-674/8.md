#### Robert Jordan

Last question I remember, as his characters are so well defined and rounded, if he got his inspiration from real persons or if he studied psychology; Jordan replied that he never studied psychology (if his father teaching him to play poker can be excluded...) and that he doesn't write his characters after real persons, but that he tries to make them as real as he can, even the ones that only appear for a few sentences, trying to keep them consistent.
