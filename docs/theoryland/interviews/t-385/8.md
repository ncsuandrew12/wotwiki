And then,
*A Memory of Light*
is due out next fall. You said, was it November, I think?

#### Brandon Sanderson

November's the goal. November is the goal. Understand that there are a whole lot of different factors going into this. It will depend on how much editing it takes, how quickly I'm able to get the characters right. I'm going to work on it, I'm working on it more than full time. I'm pulling big long hours, I'm trying to get this done as soon as possible. But, it also has to be the best book.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

Right. So that's going to be back and forth with you and Harriet, right?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, back and forth with me and Harriet. I will have the rough draft done probably by December. Right now it's October. But how long it takes to get the rough draft polished and perfected, that's the uncertain quality here. And so, the goal will be November.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

Okay.
