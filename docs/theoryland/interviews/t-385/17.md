#### Alex C. Telander

And then for the last question here tonight, what's your favorite TV show?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Daily Show, Jon Stewart. I used to watch it with Craig Kilborn and think it was the coolest thing ever. And then like, you know, Jon Stewart came along, and I'm like, who's this hoser? And then he made the show like about forty times better.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

That's how I get my news, usually.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

So yeah, I love The Daily Show.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

Okay. All right, well thank you very much again.
