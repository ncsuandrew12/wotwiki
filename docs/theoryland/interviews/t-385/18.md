# [Interview #385: BookBanter Interview, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=385#18)

#### Alex C. Telander

And there you have my interview with Brandon Sanderson, who is just a great guy. And now we move on to some facts and details he gave away during the Q&A session after his reading about
*A Memory of Light*
, the last book in the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series that he's currently working on.

Now, while
*A Memory of Light*
is considered one whole book by Sanderson, it will likely be very long and divided into two volumes. If you go to his blog at brandonsanderson.com, you can see how he's doing with his updated word count for
*A Memory of Light*
. He plans on making it into two books, with the first one due out next November, followed by possibly the second book coming out in the following March, 2010.

It will be up to Robert Jordan's wife, Harriet Rigney, as to whether Sanderson will be doing the prequels to the Wheel of Time series, the first one of which was New Spring. Sanderson says there's about a fifty percent chance of this happening.

Sanderson will also ask Tor, his publisher, to do a companion book after
*A Memory of Light*
is published which will explain how Sanderson wrote the book, which parts were his, which were Robert Jordan's, and where the two met. He also hopes to include a CD with the book of dictations made by Jordan just before he died.

So we have
*A Memory of Light*
due out next November 2009, with the second part due out possibly in March 2010.
