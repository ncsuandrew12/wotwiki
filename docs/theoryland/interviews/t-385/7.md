#### Alex C. Telander

It's a great honor to be chosen to complete Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it is.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

How were you chosen?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

How was I chosen? I got up one morning, and there was a voicemail on my phone from someone that said, "Hello, Brandon Sanderson. This is Harriet Rigney, Robert Jordan's widow. I'd like you to call me. I have something I want to discuss with you."

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

Had you ever met her before or anything?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I'd never met her before. I had seen Robert Jordan once at a convention, been too embarrassed to go up and talk to him. I had not applied, or asked my agent to apply, or anything like this. I was known at Tor as a big fan of the series. I had also written on my web site some thoughts about what Robert Jordan's books had meant in my life. But none of it was really an attempt. . . I assumed somebody had already been chosen.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

Right. Do you know if you were the only one on the list?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I know there were others on the list. I am not at liberty to say who they were. But, that first call was just a 'would you be willing?' And so I said, yes, of course. Well, what I actually said was, "aabbl, aabbbl, aabbbl. . ." I actually sent her an email the next day saying, "Dear Harriet, I'm not an idiot. I promise." I was just so surprised. And so, she then read Mistborn. She later told me, she said, "I got just 50 pages into it and I knew." But then she kept reading to make sure. She thought about it for about a month, she called me back. As I understand, she didn't ever look at any of the other people who were being considered, she just went with me. She really, really liked Mistborn.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

That's pretty great!
