# [Interview #385: BookBanter Interview, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=385#16)

#### Alex C. Telander

So how is it that you and David Farland keep doing the book tours together?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We live about four hours apart. And he is my former teacher in sort of an Obi-wan Kenobi/Qui-gon Jinn sort of way. Hopefully not in an Anakin Skywalker sort of way. But I was the Padawan, I took one of his classes early on. We just get along really well. And I think that the publisher knows they can send us on tour together and we can take care of ourselves.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

And have fun together?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yeah, and have fun, and keep each other company. And it's pretty economical because we'll share a hotel room, we'll share a car ride. Tour is . . . every year when we've asked, hey can we tour? They'll say yes because they know all of those things.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

Okay.
