#### Alex C. Telander

What do you like to read in your spare time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Whatever ends up in my hands. Sometimes nonfiction, sometimes fiction. I still, I mean, I love fantasy. I've been reading a lot of children's lately. Favorite author right now who's still publishing is probably Terry Pratchett. But favorite historical writers have been Robert Jordan, I really like
*Les Miserables*
, it's one of my favorite books of all time. I actually really like Melville. A lot of people don't, but I really like Melville.

#### ALEX C. TELANDER

I like
*Moby Dick*
, yeah.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Not just
*Moby Dick*
, but all of it. Billy Budd and other stuff, too, just fun to read. So, whatever I end up reading.
