# [Interview #385: BookBanter Interview, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=385#2)

#### Alex C. Telander

Welcome to Episode 2 of BookBanter. I'm your host, Alex C. Telander. And in this episode, it's all things Brandon Sanderson. Sanderson is the author of
*Elantris*
and the now
*New York Times*
best-selling Mistborn series. The concluding book in the trilogy recently came out, called
*Hero of Ages*
. He is also the author who has been chosen to complete the final volume in Robert Jordan's best-selling Wheel of Time series.

I was able to see Brandon Sanderson recently at a reading on his
*Hero of Ages*
book tour, and I was also able to get an exclusive interview with him. So on the podcast today we will have that interview in its entirety, followed by some details and facts about the last book in the Wheel of Time series that Sanderson is currently working on, called
*A Memory of Light*
.

And then we will conclude the podcast with two book reviews on Sanderson's books,
*Elantris*
and the first book in the Mistborn trilogy,
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
. So now let's get to the interview which Brandon Sanderson kindly allowed, which took place just after his reading with David Farland on November 1st.
