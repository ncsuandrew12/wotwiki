#### Jason Denzel

Harriet and RJ have asked me to publish these quick thank you's:

#### Robert Jordan

Dear Chris Lim, thank you very much for your gift in my honor to the Hematologic Malignancies Program—amyloidosis research. It is a great compliment to me and I am very grateful to you. Sincerely, Robert Jordan

#### HARRIET MCDOUGAL RIGNEY

Another dear person has sent a gift to Mayo. Please post Jim's thank-you to Mr. John Smedley.

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Dear John Knam, Greg Pearson, Michael Kemp, William Walker, Carlos Franco, and Jenna Medaris: Thank you very much for your kind gifts to the Hematologic malignancies Program—Amyloidosis research at Mayo. I am honored and touched by all your gifts. Sincerely, Robert Jordan

P.S. If I have already thanked you, forgive the redundancy. Things got a little hectic there. Best, RJ

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to Bob Mimlitch and to Richard Zoppo, both of whom have sent gifts to the Mayo Hematologic Malignancies Program -- amyloidosis research, in my honor.

You touch me very deeply. Thank you again. Robert Jordan.
