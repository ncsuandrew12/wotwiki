# [Interview #516: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=516#4)

#### Patrick

Many writers seem to be perfectionists at heart. Looking back on the published form of
*The Gathering Storm*
, what do you wish you could do to fine-tune that novel now that readers have started to comment on its presumed weaknesses?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do wish I'd had was more time to polish the book. There was no more time; that book had to come out last year. The drafting process was so quickâ€”I did 17 drafts of that book across the space of just a short number of months. Anytime you do a draft, artifacts show up. You say the wrong thing, or you're thinking about one scene while writing another, and shift the tone the wrong direction. Or you just delete a word here or insert the wrong word.

If I have one feeling about weaknesses the book has, it's that there are a few little rough edges that I would like to have smoothed out. We're catching a lot of those for the paperback release.
