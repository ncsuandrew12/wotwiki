# [Interview #516: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=516#11)

#### Patrick

Between working on the final WoT installments and
*The Way of Kings*
, what changes have you noticed in your approach to writing after spending much of the past two years working with Team Jordan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

For one thing, I hired an assistantâ€”because Maria and Alan were so wonderful to have and to work with, I realized I needed that myself. In fact, my assistant is recording these answers from me on his iPhone, and then will transcribe them, and that's what you're reading right now.

What else has changed? I have gotten much better at dealing with epic scope, continuity, and large numbers of viewpoint characters. And, you know, I've had to be much more focused. In the past, I would often jump back and forth and do little side projects here and there. These past few years, I haven't had nearly as much time for that sort of thing. That's been both good and bad, because it has taught me to be more focused, but I also miss the days when I could jump over and do a random steampunk story, then jump back to whatever I was working on.

I think I'm getting better at description and prose, which has always been the weakest part of my novels (I feel). And I've learned a lot about character voice and how to manipulate it.
