# [Interview #516: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=516#9)

#### Patrick

Is it still the plan to publish
*Towers of Midnight*
in late 2010 and
*A Memory of Light*
in late 2011, or are those dates likely to change?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Towers of Midnight*
is still very likely for late 2010. You'll have to ask me next year about
*A Memory of Light*
. Everything I've got is focused on
*Towers of Midnight*
right now, and it's going to be very tight, but I think we can do it.
