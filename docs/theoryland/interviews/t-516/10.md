# [Interview #516, Entry #10]: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=516#10)

#### Patrick

Speaking of
*Towers of Midnight*
, without giving anything away, what can fans expect from the novel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As I said before, if there is a character who fans didn't see in
*The Gathering Storm*
, chances are they are in
*Towers of Midnight*
. What else can we expect to see? Things are getting worse and worse. The Last Battle is approaching, and it's coming quickly.
