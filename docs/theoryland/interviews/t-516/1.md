# [Interview #516: Pat's Fantasy Hotlist: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=516#1)

#### Patrick

Yes, you've been waiting for this one for a while, and here it is!

I owe a debt of gratitude to Brandon Sanderson for accepting to do this. I have a feeling that Brandon probably agreed to do the interview at a time when he didn't quite realize how demanding completing The Wheel of Time would turn out to be. And yet, though he has a crazy schedule, he still managed to find some time to answer our questions candidly. Let us hope we can do it again following the release of
*Towers of Midnight*
!

Kudos also for my three partners in crime for helping me put this Q&A together: Larry (Dylanfanatic) from

, Adam (Werthead) from

, and Ken (KCF) from

. Funny thing, we all became online buddies on the Other Fantasy message board on the now defunct wotmania.com way before we became major players in the SFF Blogosphere. Needless to say, this interview would never have turned out so well without their participation!

Many thanks also to all the fans who submitted questions. A few were picked up or were integrated into existing questions, so there is a part of you in this Q&A.

The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. . .

Enjoy!
