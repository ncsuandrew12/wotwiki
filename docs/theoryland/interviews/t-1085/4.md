#### Harriet McDougal (paraphrased)

Harriet named about 75% of the chapters in the series.

#### Adam Whitehead

The panel spent an intense five minutes arguing about Bela's death. When I tried to suggest that we talk about the human characters who died, no-one was really interested. It was all about the horse.
