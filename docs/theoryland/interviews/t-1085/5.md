# [Interview #1085: Details on the Wheel of Time Companion, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1085#5)

#### Maria Simons (paraphrased)

Jordan tried to protect Maria from spoilers in the work he had her do for him. She eventually persuaded him she could handle them. Almost the first thing he then gave her was Verin's full backstory. This was somewhere around the time
*Path of Daggers*
came out.

The oddest research request was Jordan asking how babies feel when they are born. This was eventually used in the bonding scene in
*Winter's Heart*
.
