# [Interview #708: Alloy of Law Reddit Q&A, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=708#4)

#### [Ace\_of\_Face (Reddit.com)](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ace_of_Face)

Who wrote the "Ars Arcanum"? Since the writer obviously had knowledge of the Cosmere I assumed that it was you making an editorial note, but then I thought that it could be Hoid (who was suspiciously absent) or Sazed or any Shardbearer... Does that make sense at all?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit.com)](http://www.reddit.com/user/mistborn)

The Ars Arcanum is written in-cosmere by someone, but I don't want to saw who yet.

#### Footnote

Hoid is indeed in
*Alloy of Law*
. He's the beggar in black that is at the wedding in chapter 5.
