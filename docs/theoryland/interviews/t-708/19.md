What would it take for me to successfully bribe you into writing a sequel to Alloy?
I think you may have answered this one before, but where do you come up with your names for all your characters?
Thank you! I really love your work.

I will probably do one anyway.

It depends on the series. For Mistborn, I build a 'feel for certain regions and develop names using the linguistic rules of that region. The Central Dominance (and Elendel in this book) had a slightly French feel to the linguistics, and many of the names came from that paradigm.

However, unique to the Mistborn world was the need to give people simple nicknames in a thieving crew sort of way. Wax, Clubs, Breeze, Mr. Suit, all of these are along those lines.
