The
*Alloy of Law*
left me wanting more books in the universe right away. Any hints as to when we might get to see the next trilogy?

My current plan is to hold out on the second trilogy until I've reached a breaking point in the Stormlight Archive. (So after book five.) My reasoning is that the second trilogy is very involved, and I'm not certain if I want two thick-booked series going at once. There is a good chance I'll return and do another shorter book, like this one, in the world before then. Either about Wax, or perhaps a quick glimpse of the southern continent.

That's awesome! I really enjoyed both worlds, but right now the Stormlight Archive is the one that got me totally hooked.
How was the reception for the first Stormlight compared to
*Alloy of Law*
? :)

I would say the reception is about what I hoped.
*The Way of Kings*
has made much more of an impact, as I would hope would be the case. A book that is the result of many years of effort compared to a fun diversion...well, I would be worried if
*Alloy of Law*
had been the one everyone latched onto.

That said, I've been very pleased with the reception to
*Alloy of Law*
. The sales are strong, and most people seem to be enjoying it for what it is rather than expecting it to be something it is not.
