# [Interview #708: Alloy of Law Reddit Q&A, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=708#7)

How long before
*Way of Kings*
is
*Alloy of Law*
? I heard somewhere that it's a hundred years, but I don't think that's right.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit.com)](http://www.reddit.com/user/mistborn)

I intended them to be happening roughly close to one another, with
*Way of Kings*
slightly before.

#### Footnote

This is in conflict with
earlier
reports, so it was
confirmed
