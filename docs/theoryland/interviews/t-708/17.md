I dislike double posting, but I have one question that came up recently from your tweet. You said that there are "multiple" people from Mistborn in WoK. Does this include Hoid?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Reddit.com)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Bookclub/comments/oji9u/the_alloy_of_law_qa_with_brandon_sanderson/c3intsp)

Yes, it does.

#### [CORWIN01](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Bookclub/comments/oji9u/the_alloy_of_law_qa_with_brandon_sanderson/c3k779g)

Are they just vague allusions?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Bookclub/comments/oji9u/the_alloy_of_law_qa_with_brandon_sanderson/c3l5gi8)

Vague, no. But I wouldn't say they, save Hoid, have any important impact on the events of the book.
