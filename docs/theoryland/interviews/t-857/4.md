#### Brandon Sanderson

Here are two more cool pieces of fan art. The second one is a painting that the artist Megan brought to show me at my signing in Idaho Falls. Thanks!

Finally, the blog The Ranting Dragon is having a "cover battle" that I thought was pretty cool. You can vote for which cover art/design you like best, and the top vote-getters will face off against each other for . . . supreme domination or something. The competition is quite stiff, but the ebook cover for
*The Emperor's Soul*
(art by Alexander Nanitchkov, design by Isaac Stewart) is in the
[first round](http://www.rantingdragon.com/the-cover-battle-of-2012-phase-1-round-1/)
. I love this art and the design, so I'm happy to see it nominated! You can vote for whichever cover you like, and you can also write in other options. For an explanation of the different rounds see
[here](http://www.rantingdragon.com/cover-battle-of-2012-help-us-find-the-years-best-cover/)
