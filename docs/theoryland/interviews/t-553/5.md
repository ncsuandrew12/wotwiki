# [Interview #553, Entry #5]: TOM Signing Report - jemron](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#5)

About an hour of prepping, and the crowd outside was getting bigger. Brandon shows up at 8pm, and then the fun really began.

Brandon is just so chill. He's one of us. A fan, a nerd, a human being. It was so cool to be able to talk with him as he signed all the books. Each signature was important to him. If the table was bumped, or if he made the tiniest mistake, he did whatever he could to make it right. He cares about the fans and it really shows through with how he treats everything he does.

We asked him all sorts of questions but few were actually related to spoilers/teasers.
