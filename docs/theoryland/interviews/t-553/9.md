# [Interview #553, Entry #9]: TOM Signing Report - jemron](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#9)

#### Brandon Sanderson

At around 10:30 or 11, Brandon did a reading from Chapter 2 of
*Towers of Midnight*
. It was a nice reading, but I had already listened to it from the free audio version that Tor provided a few weeks ago. No offense to Brandon, but Michael Kramer does a bit better job at reading the books than Brandon does. At least Brandon does a good job of writing them!

After that was a Q&A where Brandon took many questions from the audience. I was running around for a lot of it, and so I didn't get to hear much of them. Hopefully
[Matt's write-up will include some or all of these at Theoryland.com](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554)
