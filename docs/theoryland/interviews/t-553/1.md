# [Interview #553: TOM Signing Report - jemron, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#1)

#### jemron

First off, why are you reading this when you could be reading your new copy of
*Towers of Midnight*
?

Second, thanks for reading this!

Third, this post will be updated on occasion as more Tower Guards send me their reports. For now, you get to read my report (jemron) of the Event! Be warned: IT IS LONG! Like Loial, I don't know the meaning of the word "brief."

Fourth, I'm still a bit bleary-eyed from the release party, and it was a day and a half ago. Some of the details are crisp in my mind, and some are very fuzzy. I'll do my best to recall the Event as I remember it. Pictures also help. There will shortly be LOTS of pictures posted in the gallery of the event. I'll also try and break this overly long report up with some cool pictures that I and other Tower Guards took of the Event.

Fifth, enough lists, let's get to it!
