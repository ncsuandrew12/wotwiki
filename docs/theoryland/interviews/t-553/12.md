# [Interview #553: TOM Signing Report - jemron, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#12)

#### jemron

What an Event! I had a blast. I met a lot of really great people, met Brandon (though I had "met" him before, after that night, I felt like I knew him), and, most importantly, I got my book!! Brandon wrote this in my book, "To Jemron, you stood at your post bravely Tower Guard."

Thanks everybody who participated.

Now... where's my book?
