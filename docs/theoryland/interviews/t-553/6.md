# [Interview #553: TOM Signing Report - jemron, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#6)

#### jemron

One of the questions that I asked him was, "Do you think it is fair to you, as a prolific author, to be asked by the rest of "Team Jordan" to write the prequels and/or outriggers?"

I asked because as a BWS fan and as a WoT fan, I'm torn between wanting to let Brandon get on with his other work (he still has nine Stormlight books to write, six
*Mistborn*
books, an
*Elantris*
sequel, a
*Warbreaker*
sequel or two, AND another 10 book series called
*Dragonsteel*
to write!), and wanting to see more WoT after the main series ends. I told him this, and he was very open about it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said, honestly, it probably wouldn't happen. But, he said, if Harriet does want them written (which he seemed to indicate that she probably wouldn't at this point) he says he would want to be the only choice to write them. He said he feels like he more of a right to it than any other author, though he can't call it his work/world, it is a part of him now, and he wouldn't want anybody else writing those other books.
