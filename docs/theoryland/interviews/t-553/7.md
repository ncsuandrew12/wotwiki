# [Interview #553: TOM Signing Report - jemron, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#7)

#### jemron

Anyway, Tamyrlin will be posting a much more
[in-depth write-up of the questions and answers](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=554)
from that night, so I won't write any of that here. Brandon had also brought just three things with him (that I could tell). An ARC (advanced reader copy) of
*The Way of Kings*
which was to be given out to a lucky winner as a prize and two of his special decks of Magic: The Gathering cards that he hoped to be able to use in a game or two before the event.

We also had several other cool prizes donated by various people, including Tor (thanks for the bumper stickers and goodies!!), Inkwing.com (those t-shirts ROCKED, thanks guys for this!—checkout their site for awesome BWS paraphernalia), Theoryland, and the BYU Bookstore (thank you guys too).

All the prizes were lying out on a table and, sadly, someone stole the ARC of
*The Way of Kings*
right off of the prize table!! The one thing that Brandon himself brought to give away to a lucky fan, and it was stolen. I was saddened that someone who likely calls him/herself a "fan" did that! I felt for a moment that whoever did that made all of us, as fans look bad. Then I decided that that thief is not a true fan anyway, so it doesn't affect me. I’m still angry about it though and I could tell Brandon was disappointed too when he found out. I hope it will be returned!
