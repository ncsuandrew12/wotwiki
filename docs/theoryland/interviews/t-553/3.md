# [Interview #553: TOM Signing Report - jemron, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=553#3)

I also met some really cool people at the front of the line, including a guy who flew in all the way from Sweden! Some of these people had been camped out since the Thursday afternoon before. One guy told us he was out here on a "family vacation" from Australia, but that he secretly planned the whole thing without telling his wife that the real reason for coming here was the Midnight Release party! How cool is that?!

The giddiness/excitement for the Event was palpable from the start. I immediately got sidetracked from my "duties" and started talking to people in line about theories, the WoT movies, and other WoT related stuff. I just kept getting pulled into conversations, though I should've been helping setup. And even though I also love discussing on-line via chat and/or forums, there's just nothing better than discussing the books with real people. I love this about these events. This is why we should all plan on going to JordonCon next year (and Jennifer didnâ€™t even pay me to say that).
