## [Entry #1](./t-1142/1)

#### BlackYeti

Regarding Vasher, what was his name before he returned?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a RAFO, but just a minor one. Vasher's past is a factor in Nightblood the book, and so I'm staying away from all answers about that.

## [Entry #2](./t-1142/2)

#### BlackYeti

In the Final Empire, Kelsier says that it will take 300 years before atium grows back in the Pits of Hathsin. How does he know this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think it is mentioned somewhere else how long it takes a crystal to regrow, and he's just basing it on the past, when a crystal is damaged, how long it takes one to come back. I'm pretty sure that that is even mentioned somewhere, but if not, that's just how he knows.

## [Entry #3](./t-1142/3)

#### BlackYeti

With most magic systems, you've said that you need some sort of gap in your soul for the investiture to get in. On Nalthis, there's obviously a bit that they can give away. Is this how Vasher is able to get Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. (Brandon looked like he was going to expand on this, but he just repeated yeah instead.)

## [Entry #4](./t-1142/4)

#### BlackYeti

Suppose you had a full feruchemist, who got enough breath to reach the fifth Heightening. What would happen if he started storing in atium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs) I'm going to RAFO that one.

## [Entry #5](./t-1142/5)

#### BlackYeti

Kandra, you're not getting any more of those. But they can die, so what's stopping them from creating new creating new Kandra out of the mistwraith by recycling the Blessings?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is mostly just cultural. (As we were leaving, after I'd turned the recording off, Brandon expanded on this a bit. So this next part's not verbatim, but he said that in The Bands of Mourning, we might expect to see Kandra using other Kandra's spikes.)

## [Entry #6](./t-1142/6)

#### BlackYeti

You've said before that the Horneaters are hybrids, half-human...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really half any more, but yeah.

#### BlackYeti

Are there any other hybrid creatures, would you consider the Koloss-blodded to be this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really, I don't consider them, but the Herdazians also have a bit of Parshendi in them.

## [Entry #7](./t-1142/7)

#### BlackYeti

With regards to the Dor, whereabouts is it located exactly in regards to the Realms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh you're the first person to ask this one. It is in the Cognitive Realm. I think you might be the first one to crack that one. So, that's something that I've been dancing around for a while, waiting 'til people started to figure that one out. That's not where most of them are.

## [Entry #8](./t-1142/8)

#### BlackYeti

There's some similarity in the effect of Hemalurgy and the Dakhor magics. What would happen if you were to try combining the two?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You would have some pretty evil dude, I would expect.
