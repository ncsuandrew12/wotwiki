#### Question

If you were burned out and then transmigrated, would you still be burned out? [You answered that you were pretty sure that it was a yes, but that we should feel free to MAFO].

#### Maria Simons

Yes, you would. Jim said that "neither burning out or stilling affects that except in this lifetime, your current lifetime." (DragonCon), but transmigration is not really a different lifetime; more than just the soul moves. The new person (I'm at a loss for words here) also has the memories of the previous person, and its personality, and such. So Brandon is correct.
