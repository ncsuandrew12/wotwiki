#### Question

Did Robert Jordan leave a power to time comparison, as to how much time is burned back on a thread using balefire? Is there a calculation that says x amount of power will burn back x amount of time on a thread?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO. Sorry, but we are doing an encyclopedia, and I have to reserve some things in case we want to put them in there.
