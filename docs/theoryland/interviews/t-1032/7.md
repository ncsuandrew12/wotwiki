Any good reads you recommend for the book fans?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have recently read
*Promise of Blood*
by Brian McClellan. I guess it's been a few months now. I really like that. The other most recent book I read is an unpublished novel that I'm hoping will be published because I thought it was fantastic, by a friend of mine. It's called
*A Thousand Faces*
â€”I don't know if she'll end up changing that title. But,
*Promise of Blood*
, very good, highly recommended. And if you're looking for something great, and you haven't tried Terry Pratchett, he's one of my go-to recommendations. I love Pratchett's work. Don't start with the first one. Start with
*Guards! Guards!*
, or
*The Truth*
.
