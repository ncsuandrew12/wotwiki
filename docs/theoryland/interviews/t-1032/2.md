Tell us about
*Steelheart*
in your own words.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hi, I'm Brandon Sanderson, author of various and sundry novels. And,
*Steelheart*
â€”
*Steelheart*
's my newest novel, coming out on Tuesday, the 24th of September. I am super excited about it. It is a story about what happens when people start gaining superpowers, but only evil people get them. And so it's kind of a post-apocalyptic action-adventure thriller filled with evil supervillains.
