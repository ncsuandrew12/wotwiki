# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#16)

#### Eleanor

If Rand dies, or seems to die, or almost dies, will there be a secondary reason other than cool factor or him being loved for bringing him back?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### ELEANOR

I thought I'd manage to dodge a RAFO with this setup, but of course to answer it he would have to confirm Rand's death or otherwise.
