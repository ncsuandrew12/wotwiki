# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#19)

#### Eleanor

Are there any Darkfriends—you'll be able to see where I am going with this—amongst the Wise Ones, the main Wise Ones with names, we have seen on screen and know?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Laughs.) RAFO.

#### ELEANOR

Again, you ask a terrible question...BUT THERE IS MORE ON THIS.

I think he felt a little sad about my Sorilea attempt and his inevitable RAFO, and thus offered the following tidbit:

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

"At least one of the named characters is an unrevealed Darkfriend."

#### ELEANOR

I know that this is pretty much a given anyway, but the way he said it—the way he
*presented*
it (with this gleam in his eyes and an invisible flourish) it suggests it is...not any old named character, but one with some importance. Of course, that is just my opinion and as such is...debatable.

But have we a list of second- and third-tier named characters who could possibly be Darkfriends?
