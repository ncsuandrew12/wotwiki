# [Interview #753, Entry #8]: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#8)

#### Eleanor

Why is such a big deal made about the silence from the Black Tower when Nynaeve reached them without fuss?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Myrelle wasn't inside the grounds. They had been locked out.

#### ELEANOR

This one should have been caught on my filters. Realised it as soon as it came out.

#### FOOTNOTE—LUCKERS

This isn't actually the answer; this is the problem. Why is there a silence when the Rebel embassy can be easily reached by gateway and vice versa? To quote Romanda, "They should have at least sent word. This silence is disturbing." That was the point behind the question—why is there such a big deal made when Nynaeve could reach them without fuss?
