# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#7)

#### Zombie Sammael

We know access to the True Power is a matter of wanting it and the Dark One letting you. Are there any other conditions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well... (This is not quite verbatim.) You have to be human of course, and all the other things as with the One Power. I don't believe so, but I am not sure. (Don't take this last sentence as gospel as I may not recall it correctly.)

#### ELEANOR

I think we need to clarify what sort of conditions so he can say yes or no to them. Maybe MAFO?
