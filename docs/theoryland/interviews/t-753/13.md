# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#13)

#### Eleanor

I had
*Warbreaker*
and
*The Way of Kings*
parts 1 and 2 for him to sign today and I had slipped a pack of MTG cards in
*Warbreaker*
; given he wasn't there at 10.50am, I thought he'd need them. He was happy.
