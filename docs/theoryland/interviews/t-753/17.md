# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#17)

#### Eleanor

Did you write the Mat/Hinderstap sections first?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(This is not verbatim.) Yes, I did, and I know there is a flow issue there. They were amongst the first chapters I wrote and at that stage I had not realized that most of Mat's humor is in how he reacts to his surroundings.

#### ELEANOR

There was a bit more to this; I wish I could recall more, but a lot of cues I need are missing from these notes, although what I have has been brilliant so far. Many thanks to my faithful Gaidin.
