#### Eleanor

Did Verin reveal any Darkfriends to anyone other than Egwene? Like in the little red-sealed letters or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### ELEANOR

(Blinked.) Can you...I don't know...?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

(Laughs) No.

#### ELEANOR

Did this for the Weiramon eyes thing people, to see if we could rule out her letters to Rand. Nope.
