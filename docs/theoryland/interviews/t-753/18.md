# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#18)

#### Eleanor

What information can you give me on how the Seanchan/
*damane*
/channeling thing will pan out in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can tell you it will be addressed in the book. (A bit more was said, but not much save me acknowledging I had not expected much of an answer from this one.)

#### ELEANOR

Yes, you ask a terrible question...and you actually get a better, less pitying answer than it merits. I was not very hopeful with this question but could not think of a way to de-RAFO-worthy it.
