# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#6)

#### Eleanor

Will all the questions Rand and Moiraine asked of the Aelfinn be revealed in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.(Will we know more?) They will be partially revealed.

#### ELEANOR

This one I can't remember too well from the notes taken, so the wording may be a little off. He looked certain and a little cheerful on this one.
