No other notable questions—another amusing reenactment of him getting the phone call for completing WoT as well as questions about linking his worlds with some discussion of Asimov's attempts in that regard. We also heard of the Sherlock-themed Asmodean theory sent in by a fan to RJ, which he left on a pile with a post-it saying "This is right", and how Sanderson wanted fans to find out the same way he did—in a glossary, with nothing more than "This is right".
