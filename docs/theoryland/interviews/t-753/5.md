# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#5)

#### Eleanor

What is the exact location of the Fields of Merrilor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There will be a map in
*A Memory of Light*
. (Added something along the lines about not being aware of debate on the location.)

#### ELEANOR

I wish I'd had the full background on the debate on this one with me. As it was, I didn't have enough to describe with any clarity. I know the basics of the contradiction but not the full story.
