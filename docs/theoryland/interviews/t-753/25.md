# [Interview #753, Entry #25]: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#25)

#### Eleanor

Here's something you can't RAFO! This has probably been asked elsewhere, but how do you think your experience writing these books has influenced your own style?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh! RAFO! Ok...just kidding.

#### ELEANOR

This was a long response, but I have managed to capture the gist of it in this summary, I think. It boiled down to it made him more aware of the littler things, and how aware he became of RJ's extreme subtlety and his skill in very delicate foreshadowing. I really, really wish I had a dictaphone or some such at this point, as it was absolutely fascinating. If this question could be asked again once
*A Memory of Light*
and one more of his own books is published, it'd be absolutely fascinating to see his answers then and compare them. He may even (he said nothing of this; this is just me pondering) write a blog post once it is out and done.
