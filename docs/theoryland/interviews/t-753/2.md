# [Interview #753: Gold Coast SupaNova - Eleanor Chandler-Temple, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=753#2)

#### Terez

Is Taim's palace made of [Shayol Ghul rock]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### ELEANOR

Brandon looked a bit uncomfortable/hesitant answering this one. Not sure I should have warned him it was a Terez one, but he answered all the same. Theories, anyone? ALSO: Followup question asked Sun 22. Can someone ask how the stone got there? Was it dragged by teams to where it was safe to gateway?

#### FOOTNOTEâ€”TEREZ

This question was also asked by
[another person](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=752)
. I was going to ask about the stone that Taim used as his podium, a symbol of his office, beginning in
*Lord of Chaos*
, but I figured the description was too complicated for a question I had to pass on to be asked by someone else. I was thinking everything at the Black Tower was made with that same rock, so I said to ask about Taim's palace. Turns out only the walls are made out of that rock, and the original podium is still used as a podium in the palace. The palace is white marble, though it has black stone columns. Brandon probably knew the walls were made out of Shayol Ghul rock, and assumed I knew what I was talking about with the palace. (I didn't.) I didn't expect him to answer the question with a 'yes', or I might have put more effort into looking it up first. So we can probably assume that the podium and the walls are made of Shayol Ghul rock, and possibly also Moridin's Blightfortress and the Towers of Midnight in Imfaral. The significance is probably mostly symbolic, like the red-and-black floor tiles in Taim's palace.
