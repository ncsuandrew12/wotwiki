Day Two—Sunday 22 April—approximately 11.50am. Lupus only questions.

Brandon Sanderson was late this day and had suitcases with him, so he may have been a little frazzled. I got the rest of my books signed and waited for the queue that had built to massive size get down to a reasonable length before starting his torment. I've tried to address the major theories I can recall off the top of my head, but given I've had about 10 hours sleep in the last 4 or 5 days, and the longest continual stretch 3.5 hours on Saturday morning, I was not as successful at avoiding RAFOs, and most of my slyness was...well, blatant.
