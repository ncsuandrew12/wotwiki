# [Interview #535, Entry #7]: Mad Hatter's Bookshelf and Book Review: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=535#7)

#### Mad Hatter

Glad to hear you'll be back in the short game. Can you take us through a normal writing day? Do you have a word count goal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It depends on the day and the book, but generally 2,000 words is my goal. 3,000 to 4,000, probably around 3,500 is a really solid day for me. A basic writing day: I get up at noon or 1:00, depending on when I went to bed. I play with my son for about an hour, giving my wife a break. Then I go downstairs for four or five hours, check my email, write for a while, go up and have dinner, play with my son some more, then go back down and go back to work until Iâ€™m done for the night. The last couple of years have been pretty much a lot of me with my laptop on my couch or in my beanbag chair writing books.
