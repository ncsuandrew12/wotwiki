# [Interview #535: Mad Hatter's Bookshelf and Book Review: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=535#11)

#### Mad Hatter

You’ve obviously been indisposed the last few months with
*Towers of Midnight*
so I’m curious about what is on your nightstand to be read next?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There’s a big stack. Peter Orullian’s book, which Tor is releasing next year is one I’ve wanted to read for a while.
*Spellwright*
, which a lot of people really loved and I got to read. There are a couple of Pratchetts I still haven’t read. I’ve been slowly working my way through Jim Butcher’s books, which I think are fantastic. I’ve also started reading through Brent Weeks’ works. So there are a lot of things to read. I still want to finish
*The Hunger Games*
. There’s so much to read, but fortunately during my two-week tour there will be a plane ride every day. Hooray.
