# [Interview #535: Mad Hatter's Bookshelf and Book Review: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=535#1)

#### Mad Hatter

Brandon Sanderson has quickly become a juggernaut in the Fantasy genre with not only the successful Mistborn series behind him and carrying the torch for The Wheel of Time, but with his last two solo novels both making it to the
*New York Times*
list.
*The Way of Kings*
has just hit its second week on the
*Times*
list as well.

This was a co-interview effort between myself and fellow blogger Patrick from Stomping on Yeti. All in all Brandon laid out plenty of tasty morsels I was happy to learn about. Check out the first part of the interview over at the Yeti Homestead.
*The Way of Kings*
left me wanting more and Brandon has shed some light on what he has planned and why he did things a certain way. We talk about everything from influences on the world, Magic: The Gathering, and why
*The Gathering Storm*
wasn't the right title for him.
