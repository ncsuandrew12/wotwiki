# [Interview #535, Entry #9]: Mad Hatter's Bookshelf and Book Review: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=535#9)

#### Mad Hatter

Was there any physical inspiration behind the Shattered Plains, which features so prominently in
*The Way of Kings*
? Too many visits to the Grand Canyon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’ve only been to the Grand Canyon once, but I do live in Utah, which has beautiful red rock formations and this wonderful, windblown stone formations scattered all across southern Utah. I’ve hiked there and spent a decent amount of time there. I would say that Roshar is partially inspired by that.
