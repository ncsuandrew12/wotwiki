# [Interview #535, Entry #10]: Mad Hatter's Bookshelf and Book Review: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=535#10)

#### Mad Hatter

You're an avowed Magic: The Gathering lover. What is your color combo deck of choice? Also, preferred edition? I've always leaned towards Revised/Fourth as later editions focused on counters too much for my liking.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say Black/Blue/White is what you find me playing most often, and usually Blue/White. Favorite editions? I’m going to disagree about the focus on counters. They’ve actually taken counterspells down a notch or two in recent years, which is nice. Besides, I play casual games, where I don’t run into a lot of counterspell decks, land destruction decks, or card discard decks—you know, the “un-fun” decks. My favorites recently—I really like Eldrazi, the set they released this year, which I’ve had a blast with. Other than that, probably Ravnica and Time Spiral were my favorite of the recent sets.

#### MAD HATTER

I haven't bought any new decks in a few years so I just may have to check out Eldrazi.
