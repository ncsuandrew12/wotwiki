# [Interview #1078: Steelheart Signing Report - Shardlet, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1078#23)

#### Wetlander

Was Odium able to Splinter Honor because the Heralds abandoned the Oathpact?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question. Um, their abandonment of the Oathpact is related... but mostly tangentially. If I was pinned down on that, I would say no.

#### Wetlander

Is there any of the Oathpact still functioning because of Taln's continued participation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, indeed.
