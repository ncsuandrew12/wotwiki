# [Interview #1078: Steelheart Signing Report - Shardlet, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1078#5)

#### Question

Are there going to be other characters other than Hoid that will be crossing over between books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, in fact there are characters in the way of kings...(essentially mentions the known Ishikk interlude worldhoppers). I told people that there is a Terriswoman in
*Warbreaker*
somewhere, I believe that would be somewhat hard to spot. That one, I don't think you will be able to pick out until you see her later on and then go back and say 'wait a minute'.
