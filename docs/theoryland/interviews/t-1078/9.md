# [Interview #1078: Steelheart Signing Report - Shardlet, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1078#9)

#### Question

As far as I can tell, in The Stormlight Archive, we have seen three different lights: the stormlight, the amberlight in the flashbacks, and the dark light in the stone. Do those correspond to the three Shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, the amberlight is more a function of...it's no different than the stormlight.

#### Question

So, you see that in a storm? Like when gems gather that in the storm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That amberlight is more related to... so, no... you are not seeing something other than stormlight. That is like saying that stormlight in a topaz is a different color than stormlight in a sapphire. It's not different colors; you're just seeing it filtered through something. The dark light of the, um, the gemstone that Szeth was given is indeed something different and distinct.

#### Question

Voooiidlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it is related to a different shard. How about that?
