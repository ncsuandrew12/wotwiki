# [Interview #1078: Steelheart Signing Report - Shardlet, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1078#15)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

What advice did Hawkwing give Tuon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Everyone expects Hawkwing to, like, take Tuon to task (regarding the
*Aes Sedai*
). But, people forget that he didn't care much for the
*Aes Sedai*
himself, and he also conquered the world and is sort of a tyrant, but a great tyrant, along the lines of some of the great conquerors of our world. Um, I think he would be fairly proud of Tuon, all things considered, and his advice would be more like, how to seize her country back, and things like this. People expect him to be like, "Artur Hawkwing is going tell her to let the
*Aes Sedai*
go and stop (muttered) slavery." I think he would be like, "This is awesome! You've got captive
*Aes Sedai*
?"

#### Question

I've heard that approach challenged by, because when he was so anti-Aes Sedai was because he was being influence by Ishamael.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was. He was. He was. There is definitely that. But, remember, he is part King Arthur, noble, and part Alexander the Great, conqueror and destroyer of those who opposed him. And so, keep in mind that this guy has both of those sides to him. And, even not influenced by Ishamael, being offered captive
*Aes Sedai*
who will do anything he says, this is not something that I think any ruler in the history of our world would have turned down or at least not considered strongly.
