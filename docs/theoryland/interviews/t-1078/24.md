# [Interview #1078: Steelheart Signing Report - Shardlet, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1078#24)

#### Question

Is the Palanaeum named for Palah?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. In fact, it was named based on—it was Greek in our world—the Athenaeum? It was based off of that.

#### Wetlander

Did we see Palah?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe every one of the Heralds is mentioned or shown somewhere in the first book.

#### Wetlander

Someone was wondering whether the old woman who was wandering around the Palanaeum was her.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a very good guess. I won't say specifically, because some of them are intended to be more obvious and some of them are intended to be red herrings. So, that was a very good guess.
