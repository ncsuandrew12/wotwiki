# [Interview #1078: Steelheart Signing Report - Shardlet, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1078#13)

#### Question

Will
*The Alloy of Law*
be a trilogy of its own or is it just going to be the one book you read from tonight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, the 1st one was
*The Alloy of Law*
, the one I read from tonight is the sequel, so there's at least two. I signed a contract with, well, I haven'â€™t signed anything yet. I offered Tor two more beyond
*The Alloy of Law*
; so,
*Shadows of Self*
and one more. So, I have promised Tor three of them.

#### Question

So, there could be more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not plotted this one. It does not have the same sort of interconnected arc as the others. It could go further. I think I would cautiously most likely do three or four and stop and if I wanted more short books like that, I'd pick different characters in a different location.
