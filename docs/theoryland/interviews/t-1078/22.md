#### Wetlander

Did the Splintering happen before the Recreance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will reveal this as we go. However, be aware that in the past, when a Shard was killed, the person holding it, it is a slow burn to actually kill someone; because power cannot be destroyed. So, what it means to be killed means something a little different in these cases.

*The Way of Kings*
.

#### hoser

...passed away in his sleep...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right.
