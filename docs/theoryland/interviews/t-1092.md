## [Entry #1](./t-1092/1)

#### ProfessionalLurker

Are the Elantrian pool and Horneater lake connected?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

They are the same thing.

## [Entry #2](./t-1092/2)

#### ProfessionalLurker

Any news on Alcatraz 5?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

He said he wrote the book last summer, and is waiting for the greenlight from Tor to hand it off, basically. They want to publish books 1-4 first, followed by this one. But the only thing needed is a schedule and edits! Still sounds like an early/mid 2016 thing to me.

## [Entry #3](./t-1092/3)

#### ProfessionalLurker

Where's Marsh?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Investigating the Southern Continent of Scadrial
