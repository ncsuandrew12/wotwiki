# [Interview #1067: Steelheart Release Party, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#21)

#### Question

Will Hoid be making a reappearance in
*Words of Radiance*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

I also heard he was part of your unpublished
*Dragonsteel*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is.

#### Question

And is that a series you are going to be publishing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will eventually rewrite it, it is not up to my current standards. I consider the events that happen in it basically to be canon. With some exceptions, like for instance when I originally wrote
*Dragonsteel*
the Shattered Plains were there and Dalinar was there and I split off
*Way of Kings*
into its own book. I took half of what had been
*Dragonsteel*
and made it into the Stormlight Archive and I split half of it off onto a separate planet. If you were to read it, you can check it out from BYU, half of it will be a less well-written version of the Shattered Plains sequence of
*Way of Kings*
and the other half is Hoid's story. And Hoid's story stuff is still kind of canon but the rest...
