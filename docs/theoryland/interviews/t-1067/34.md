#### Question

Are chasmfiends related to Thunderclasts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Good question though. Thunderclasts actually show up pretty early in the second book. More what thunderclasts are â€” Dalinar sees one in a flashback in the second book. So you'll get a good explanation of where they come from, but they are more related to the voidbringers where chasmfiends are actually a living part of the ecosystem

#### Question

So what is the purpose of the pupating?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will find out. Shallan is asking that very question.
