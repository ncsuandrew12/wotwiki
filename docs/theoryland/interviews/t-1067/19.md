#### Question

When are we going to see a Mistborn movie? I thought it was just around the corner?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think it would make a great movie. There are a lot of people in Hollywood who think it would make a great movie but they aren't the people with the money. Convincing the people with the money is a little harder.
