# [Interview #1067, Entry #15]: Steelheart Release Party](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#15)

#### Question

Are you going to do a midnight thing for
*Word of Radiance*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. We decided that since this [
*Steelheart*
] was a teen book we would do it at a reasonable hour instead of midnight, but all bets are off for
*Words of Radiance*
. It will be one of those midnight abominations where I'm there till six am.
