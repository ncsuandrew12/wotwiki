#### Question

In most of your magic systems people have a power or two, with the exception of
*Elantris*
are you planning on returning to that or doing a similar system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will, I like to do all kinds of different things. The thing about it is that I like having discrete powers that I can really explore. I find that a lot of magic system that have just so many things you can do â€” it isn't a bad magic system I just like to have one thing and really dig into it. I love reading the Wheel of Time which had a very expansive magic system until you come to my books where you see characters focusing on a few weaves and using them really well.
