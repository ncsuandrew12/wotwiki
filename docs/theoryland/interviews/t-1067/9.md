#### Question

In
*Rithmatist*
, how can you tell if a circle is two-starred, four-starred, or nine-starred?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's by where you start crossing the lines, where you cross the circle will determine how many, and what points it is. For example if you draw a line here, there are only a certain number of places where you can draw another line that will fit. It's just by where you start your first line intersecting it.
