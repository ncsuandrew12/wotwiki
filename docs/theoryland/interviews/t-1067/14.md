#### Question

The last book was split into three for the Wheel of Time, how much of that was yours and how much Jordan's?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He left about a hundred written pages and another hundred pages of notes specifically for the last book. It really depends on the given scene. In
*The Gathering Storm*
, if it was [Egwene] it was either written by him or from his notes and if it was Rand it was mostly me. In
*Towers of Midnight*
, if it was Mat it was probably from his notes or written by him, he wrote the entire Tower of Ghenjei sequence. But if it was Perrin it was me. He had nothing on him except leaving Malden and being in the Last Battle, so I had to fill in everything in between. In the final book, meeting at the Fields of Merrilor was him and the very last chapter, which became the epilogue, was him and a lot of the rest was me.
