#### Question

Are Kaladin and Szeth going to fight in
*Words of Radiance*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, they are both on the cover, if you have not seen it, Kaladin is on the front and Szeth is on the back and they look very antagonistically towards each other. Plus Kaladin has been hired to protect Dalinar and Szeth has been sent to kill him. So it is a reasonable expectation that they will run into each other in the second book.
