#### Question

A shardblade, what it does is cut off healing and control of an arm or whatever...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

So like if an arm got badly wounded and was bleeding out and needed to be amputated. If you went through it with a shardblade first, would that damage you in other ways?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No it wouldn't. What it does is sever the soul of the arm.

#### Question

I know like in Mistborn, if you take bits of soul out of people it messes them up.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does.

#### Question

if you do it with shardblades...

#### Brandon Sanderson

It leaves a wound...
