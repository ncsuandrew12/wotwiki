# [Interview #1067: Steelheart Release Party, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#33)

#### Question

What would you like to be working on? Do you have any ideas bouncing around in your head?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd like to write â€” the book I've wanted to write for a long time, I'll probably do it as a novella, about the planet where catching a disease gets you a magical talent. And I'll probably do that as my next novella, next year. So in between projects I'll do that one.

#### Footnote

Referring to
*The Silence Divine*
set on Ashyn
