# [Interview #1067: Steelheart Release Party, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#25)

#### Question

A lot of people I know think that you are an atheist because you've written a really great atheist, and one that we all like in Jasnah and I'm wondering if you interviewed people or if you got that from philosophy classes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I spent a suspicious amount of time hanging out on atheist forums. Really I paid attention to threads where they discussed misconceptions about them and things like that and used that to inform creating Jasnah's philosophy on life.
