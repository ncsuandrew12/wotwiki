# [Interview #1067, Entry #12]: Steelheart Release Party](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#12)

#### Question

At the end of
*The Way of Kings*
, it was probably clear enough but I didn't understand it, with Wit, was it the actual Herald or was it someone else.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Herald is the one that collapsed on the ground all shaggy haired with a shardblade. He claimed to be Talenel, who is the one they were talking about in the Prelude, whether or not he actually is is yet to be seen.

#### Question

Did he just collapse or did he form out of the air?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he walked up and fell down.
