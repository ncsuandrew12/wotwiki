# [Interview #1067: Steelheart Release Party, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#24)

#### Question

Have you ever thrown in something into one of your books from one of the other books you've written, like an easter egg?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, well all of my books are connected. There is a character in Mistborn who is in
*Elantris*
, who is in
*Warbreaker*
, who is also in
*The Way of Kings*
. Easter egg things, if you read my middle grade series, the Alcatraz books, there are all kinds of silly things thrown in there just for fun. But there's a continuing character doing cameos in each of the books.

#### Question

is it the same throughout the books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
