#### Question

What is your prefered writing tool? i.e. mac, word, etc.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I use regular Word. I like some of the tools like the Document Map and auto correct function. Over the years I've built a whole autocorrect library. It makes me feel like I spell things correctly on Word, when I really don't. The other thing I do like is wikidpad software.
