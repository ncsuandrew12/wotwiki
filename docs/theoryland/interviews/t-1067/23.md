# [Interview #1067: Steelheart Release Party, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1067#23)

#### Question

Do you spend a lot of time on google when you don't know something? Like distances?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, well I used to. Now I can just write in my manuscript "Peter find the answer to this" and I'll just let it go. He's my assistant so when he does his readthrough afterwards he's like "oh great" and he'll do all the research for me.
