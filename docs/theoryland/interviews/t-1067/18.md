#### Question

Why is
*The Rithmatist*
in our world but not in our world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wanted to do something a little more whimsical when I wrote it. Something that I didn't require myself toâ€”I just wanted something purely imaginative. And I said, if I weren't bound by anything where would I go? And I designed this really strange alternate version of our world, without forcing myself to have explanations or rationale. That's just a different process than other books I write.
