#### Kogiopsis

What would life on Nalthis be like for someone with synesthesia?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Synesthesia on Nalthis isn't something he's considered, but it would probably be about the same unless you had a lot of Breath, at which point things would get weird.

#### Footnote

Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, "together", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, "sensation") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.[1][2][3][4] People who report a lifelong history of such experiences are known as synesthetes.
