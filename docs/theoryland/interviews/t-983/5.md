# [Interview #983, Entry #5]: Rithmatist Signing Report - Kogiopsis](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=983#5)

#### Kogiopsis

How much control does he have over the
*Words of Radiance*
cover?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Some, by dint of being fairly well-known in the industry, but he's really fond of Whelan's work and more likely to pick a direction from concept sketches than push Whelan somewhere entirely new.

#### Kogiopsis

(I asked if he could, for instance, hold firm for epicanthic folds on Rosharan characters; he said probably yes, but most of Whelan's cover work has been figures in the distance for now so that isn't likely to be an issue. I didn't feel comfortable asking the same question over again re: skin color.)
