# [Interview #983: Rithmatist Signing Report - Kogiopsis, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=983#3)

#### Kogiopsis

What influenced the creation of the writing system in
*Warbreaker*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He'd been writing a lot of kind of grungy booksâ€”
*Mistborn*
and
*Elantris*
are all sort of grimyâ€”and his (editor? agent? one of the two?) pointed that out and suggested he write something colorful.

#### Kogiopsis

I think I didn't phrase my question clearly enough. He answered with an explanation of the magic system's origins instead, which is interesting but not what you wanted.
