#### Question

Is there meant to be a direct connection between the efficiency for transferring Breaths and the stamp magic in Emperor’s Soul? Because both work better with things close to what they’re supposed to be like.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Only in that all magics work on the same fundamental rules. I wasn’t specifically linking those two in my head when I wrote them. It’s a fundamental rule in the Cosmere that your perception, what you’re thinking, how much something matches what you doing, and how much you’re able to visualize what you want to have happen, it’s all related in the cognitive aspects of the magics. And the spiritual I suppose.
