# [Interview #1162: Shadows of Self-San Jose, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1162#35)

#### Question

Are you working on a sequel to Rithmatist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I started working on it, realized I didn’t know the Aztec culture well enough, so I went and read four books on Aztec culture, but by then deadlines were due on something else so I had to jump. I rebuild my outline using my new knowledge but I gotta find time to write it. It’s going to have a killer plot, I’m really excited for it.
