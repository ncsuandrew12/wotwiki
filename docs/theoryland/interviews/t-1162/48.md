#### Question

The metals, the ones used in Allomancy, are they naturally occurring on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

And all the alloys too?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, all the alloys on Rosharâ€¦ The magic of the metals, the metals are actually the key, so there is no power in the actual metal. You can use metals from other worlds. Metal is like a password.
