#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that. Fifty Shades of Grey fanfic.

#### Question

Except Brandon’s would be much tamer…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I don’t think mine would hit quite the same demographic.

#### Question

It would have an awesome magic system though.

Yeah, it would be based on the color grey, where each shade of grey produces a different magic effect.
