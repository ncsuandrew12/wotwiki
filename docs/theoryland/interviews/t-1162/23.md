#### Question

Sazed is saying that his density also increases when he increases his weight, but Wax says it doesn’t; which is it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sazed is making a mistake. His muscular structure changes to accomodate the weight, that’s what he was talking about. Strength and muscle tone and things like that. I might have gotten it wrong in that scene, I don’t really remember, but that’s what we decided to do in the end. The weight thing is really tricky.
