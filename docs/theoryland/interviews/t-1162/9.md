#### Question

If Kelsier had been born on Roshar, would he have become a Knight Radiant and if so, which order?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think there’s a possibility that some of the orders might want him, but it really depends on which period he was born in, and what he’s up to, because Kelsier has this dark streak in him and he could go villain very easily, depending on what’s going on with him. That’s kind of how I view Kelsier’s primary attribute, if channeled correctly he’s a great force for good, but he’s like right on the line.
