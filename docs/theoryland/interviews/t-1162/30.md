#### Question

Regarding Hemalurgy and its basis in the Pits of Hathsin being Ruin’s body, my theory is that Kelsier gained his Mistborn powers from being in the Pits of Hathsin.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s a good theory. I’m neither going to confirm or deny it. It is possible that you will see it confirmed or denied at some point. I’ve got some things that I want to write about Kelsier. You have not seen the last of that man, I want to write down some stuff that happened.
