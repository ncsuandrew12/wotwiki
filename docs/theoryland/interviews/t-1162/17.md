#### Question

About the pronunciation of “Sazed”.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I say “Say-Zed”, but in-world they don’t say that. Kelsier says something close to “Say-Zed”, but Sazed himself says something closer to “Saahzd”, more along the flowing way the Terrans speak, but they speak different languages, but you can say it every way you want.
