#### Question

About Paalm’s spike, is it that one specifically that allowed her to hide from Harmony?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was mostly because she was not using a spike made out of any metal that he knew. She could not have done that with any spike. Taking out one helped a bit, but a non-Harmony spike… what you’re seeing there is a weird intentional hack of the magic system that I built in.
