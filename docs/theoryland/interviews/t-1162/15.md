#### Question

How did you come up with the Lighteyes/Darkeyes thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wanted to have some kind of racism in the books that was removed from the racism we have in our world, so I could talk about it in a more isolated way related to the books. So making it related to eye colour made sense because the Voidbringers have these glowing red eyes, the Heralds have these bright eyes. So the idea that of eye colour being related to your level of nobility – which is not true! – entered the culture and became the form of racism and prejudice that they use.
