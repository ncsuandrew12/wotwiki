#### Question

In Elantris, if people are dead they do not have a pulse right? So does the blood just go straight to their legs?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know I worked out a things about this, in order to make what I was doing work I didn’t want to zombify them too much, so I gave them like a blood pump, like a pulse of the heart, very softly, every couple of minutes or something, and remember they’re being sustained directly by the magic so I was able to fudge some of the stuff. There’s some other things that would happen, like the gas would cause them to expand and such, I didn’t want to do that, I didn’t want them to go all the way to zombie and so I made some basic metabolic processes happen, but more magically caused than physically.
