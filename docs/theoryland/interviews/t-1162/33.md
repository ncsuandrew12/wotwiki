# [Interview #1162: Shadows of Self-San Jose, Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1162#33)

#### Question

Nightblood feeds on Investiture, so could an Allomancer burning, say, steel, draw Nightblood and fuel it off of that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, Nightblood would feed off that Kinetic Investiture, you could make that work. You would need to keep that portal open, and he would eat the power instead of whatever you were planning to do with it, and when you ran out of metal he’d kill you.

#### Question

Would it also work with whatever you have in a Coppermind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, theoretically that could work too. That’s a very good question, and you’re the first to ask that.
