# [Interview #1162: Shadows of Self-San Jose, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1162#16)

#### Question

If you had to pick one character to have dinner with, who would it be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’d pick Sazed. It would not be Kelsier, cause he’s kind of scary, and it would not be Hoid cause he would make fun of me.
