# [Interview #40: LOC Signing Report - Greg, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=40#6)

#### Greg

I couldn't resist telling him that I really dislike the cover to
*Lord of Chaos*
because I've had three people who know nothing about WoT see me reading the book and think I'm reading a cheesy romance novel because of that terrible picture of Rand.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ replied that they probably thought I was reading soft porn, and that some of those cheesy romance novels I was talking about are some of the best soft porn he knows of. Later someone asked to have his picture taken with RJ and he replied, "What kind of picture are we talking about? I'll only do it if I get to keep my clothes on." Oh, and RJ said that the woman on the cover of
*Lord of Chaos*
is an Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, but he doesn't know which Aes Sedai because it was changed a number of times.
