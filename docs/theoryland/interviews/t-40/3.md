# [Interview #40: LOC Signing Report - Greg, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=40#3)

#### Question

Someone asked him if he was from North or South Carolina (in my experience, most people from these states
*hate*
having their state confused with the other).

#### Robert Jordan

RJ replied, "If this were a more civilized time, I'd invite you to North Carolina for pistols for two and coffee for one."
