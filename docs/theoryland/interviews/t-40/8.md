# [Interview #40: LOC Signing Report - Greg, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=40#8)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ also told someone that about 25% of what had been figured out on the net was correct, about 25% was on the right track, and the rest was wrong.

#### GREG

I had trouble hearing these figures, so maybe someone can correct me if I've made any small errors with them. I wonder how RJ would come up with such figures, anyway? No doubt most of the "looney theories" are wrong, but I have trouble believing that the FAQ (which we pretty much know RJ has read) is 50% wrong. Then again, the FAQ does give bunch of "reasons for" and "reasons against" for certain ideasâ€”maybe that's what he means! Who knows?
