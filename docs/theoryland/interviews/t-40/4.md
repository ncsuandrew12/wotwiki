# [Interview #40: LOC Signing Report - Greg, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=40#4)

#### Greg

My girlfriend asked him about the "Trolloc" horn on his cane.

#### Robert Jordan

He said it was a ram's horn.

About the time the line was getting fairly long and the people a little restless, someone told RJ that he'd love to have a new WoT book out in February, then another in March, then another in April... RJ asked the crowd (aka "the lynch mob") to turn on this guy.
