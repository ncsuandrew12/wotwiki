# [Interview #40: LOC Signing Report - Greg, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=40#7)

#### Greg

I also asked RJ what Tor thought about the length of his series in terms of the number of books in it.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that Tor has told him to write as many books as he wants/needs to, and that Tor has never asked him to "stretch" the series out into more (money-making) books. He also said that even if Tor pressured him, he wouldn't do it.
