## [Entry #1](./t-554/1)

#### Matt Hatch

Questions and Answers During Signing

(Many of Brandon's answers are paraphrased until I can go back and transcribe the chat.)

## [Entry #2](./t-554/2)

#### Matt Hatch

Can someone without the Talent for Dreamwalking or Dreaming, but with access to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
through a
*ter'angreal*
be taught to find dreams?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know, no. That's an 80%.

The question they should be asking is could Perrin (be taught to find dreams)?

#### Matt Hatch

Can he?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't think so.

#### Matt Hatch

Well, what he can do is similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But the wolves don't know about them.

#### Matt Hatch

Well...

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not sure, but that's what I would be asking (paraphrased).

## [Entry #3](./t-554/3)

#### Matt Hatch

Can the True Power be used to create a Mask of Mirrors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Matt Hatch

Do True Power Mask of Mirrors have different attributes than One Power Mask of Mirrors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Everything done with the True Power will be slightly different.

#### Matt Hatch

Can you place a True Power Mask of Mirrors on another person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Matt Hatch

Would a True Power Mask of Mirrors persist into that person's dreams, how they see themselves?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They would see who they saw themselves as (it wouldn't persist).

## [Entry #4](./t-554/4)

#### Matt Hatch

Is the Bore larger or smaller than it was at the time of the Sealing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The same size (95% sure).

#### Matt Hatch

So, are the seals, even in their weakened state, the reason the Bore has not grown any larger?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know, yes.

## [Entry #5](./t-554/5)

#### Matt Hatch

Can Slayer dreamwalk in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
or only go there in the flesh?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Slayer cannot dreamwalk (100% sure).

#### Matt Hatch

Did Slayer's employer in
*Winters' Heart*
use the True Power to weave a gateway?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFOâ€”I need to look it up, but you can tell True Power gateways if you know what to look for, wouldn't you agree Matt?

#### Matt Hatch

Yes.

## [Entry #6](./t-554/6)

#### Question

Was Narg an especially smart Trolloc?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Narg was a smart Trolloc; there are other Trollocs that can speak the human tongue...we are talking the the top one percentile.

#### Footnote

Brandon probably meant the 99th percentile. Or the top 1%.

## [Entry #7](./t-554/7)

#### Matt Hatch

Is there a distance to pain sensitivity with the Warder bond? In essence, would I still know my Aes Sedai was being tortured or would it just be a dull pain if I was at a great distance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, distance does matter. But no, you would know that she was being tortured, even at a great distance.

## [Entry #8](./t-554/8)

#### Matt Hatch

How did the Forsaken in charge of the
*gholam*
learn of Herid Fel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. (Smile)

## [Entry #9](./t-554/9)

#### Matt Hatch

What happened to the large packs of Darkhounds that were patrolling Altara back in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We already know, don't we?

#### Matt Hatch

Honest, can't remember.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I know, but I think we do know.

#### Footnote

Brandon is probably referring to the passage in
*Winter's Heart*
[Chapter 13](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/wh/ch13.html)
where Moridin reveals that Isam (Slayer) is hunting Fain. The connection between Slayer and the new breed of Darkhounds is not explicit, but it is still pretty obvious. Luc and Isam are mentioned in connection with the Darkhounds in the
[Dark Prophecy](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=7#10)
written on the dungeon wall in
*The Great Hunt*
[Chapter 7](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/tgh/ch7.html)
. He was killing wolves in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
in
*The Shadow Rising*
[Chapter 28](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/tsr/ch28.html)
, and the reality-bending properties of the Unseen World might explain the
[T2 Darkhounds](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=94#16)
.

## [Entry #10](./t-554/10)

#### Matt Hatch

Did Verin know Fain was a Darkfriend, when we first met Verin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not sure.

#### Matt Hatch

Did Verin ever work with Fain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. She's been around him, but working with him is something different.

#### Footnote

When we first meet Verin, Fain is a known Darkfriend being held prisoner in Fal Dara.

## [Entry #11](./t-554/11)

#### Matt Hatch

We are told that the mindtrap is somehow connected to the soul. Is it possible to create
*ter'angreal*
that can hold a soul, or be tied to a soul in such a way as to capture it at death?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Many things are possible, but are improbable.

#### Matt Hatch

Was such a
*ter'angreal*
created during the Age of Legends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Many things are possible, but are improbable.

## [Entry #12](./t-554/12)

#### Matt Hatch

We are told the male Aiel channelers go to the Blight to "to kill the Dark One." And it is said "None survived long enough to face madness." Is this point of view or truth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. It's not that I don't know, it's that I think in reading the text you can answer that question yourself.
