#### Helen Lowe

Brandon, it's still a very impressive achievementâ€”and I'm very pleased that you've been able to make the time in such a busy writing and touring schedule for this interview. It's been a great pleasure having you on the blog today and I look forward to reading the next installments in both your Stormlight Archive and Mistborn series.
