# [Interview #669: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Helen Lowe, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=669#9)

#### Helen Lowe

*Elantris*
and
*Warbreaker*
are both standalone novels, but the greater body of your work comprises series. Should this be interpreted as a preference for the series form or do you enjoy both equally?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can indeed interpret that as a bit of a preference. I grew up reading the big classic fantasy series like the Wheel of Time, and I don't think you can do that as a writer like myself without developing a deep fondness and a desire to write your own. So I would say a slight preference, but some of my favorite books are standalones, like
*Tigana*
by Guy Gavriel Kay. I do think that the form of the standalone epic fantasy is a really cool one, and one that I want to experiment with more, and one that I like a lot. So while there's a slight preference, I wouldn't say that it's a deep overriding preference. I do what feels right for me for any given story.
