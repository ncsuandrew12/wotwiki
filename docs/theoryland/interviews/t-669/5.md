# [Interview #669: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Helen Lowe, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=669#5)

#### Helen Lowe

As well as the Wheel of Time novels, the first installment of what you have called your own "grand epic",
*The Way of Kings*
(Book One of The Stormlight Archive) was published in 2010 and this year won the Gemmell "Legend" Award for Best Fantasy Novel of the Year. Was there any particular significance for you in winning the award for
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sure. First off,
*The Way of Kings*
is the book of my heart—the book I've been working on for years and years. For example, it has a character in it who originated in the very first novel I tried my hand at as a young teen. Finally having this book come out is extremely fulfilling, and having people enjoy it as much as they have is even more fulfilling.

Specifically with the Gemmell Award, I'd lost the award two years in a row—in fact I'd lost three times in those two years, since I had two books nominated one of the years. Finally winning was extremely gratifying and a really big honor. Plus the actual award itself is a battleaxe. That is the best award ever.
