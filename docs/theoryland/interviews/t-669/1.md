# [Interview #669, Entry #1]: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Helen Lowe](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=669#1)

#### Helen Lowe

Brandon Sanderson has been one of the exciting new names in Fantasy fiction over the past eight years—commencing with the successful publication of
*Elantris*
in 2005, being asked to complete Robert Jordan's epic Wheel of Time series in 2007, and most recently winning this year's Gemmell "Legend" Award for
*The Way of Kings*
. So when Ruby Mitchell of Hachette mentioned the possibility of an interview I was delighted to have the opportunity—and am equally delighted to welcome Brandon today.

Hachette have also provided two copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
for giveaway—details are provided below the interview.
