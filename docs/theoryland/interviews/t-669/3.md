# [Interview #669, Entry #3]: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Helen Lowe](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=669#3)

#### Helen Lowe

What drew you to write Fantasy as opposed to any other style of fiction? What about the genre "rocks your world?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

I became a fantasy writer because of the great fantasy books I read. Other books didn't do it for me. As a young reader (I didn't really like to read), the first powerful fantasy book I read—
*Dragonsbane*
by Barbara Hambly—drew me in, captivated me, and took me to this place that could not be but that I wished could be. Nothing else excited me on that level, so that's why I write fantasy.
