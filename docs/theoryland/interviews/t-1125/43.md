# [Interview #1125: Changing Hands, AZ, Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#43)

#### ZenBossanova

This last one I got, was really interesting. I asked about predicting High Storms, because I was thinking of making a Stormwarden manual. I figured if Tolkien started with linguistics because he was a word nerd, then what is a math teacher supposed to do? I asked if knowing the positions/orbits of the moons would be enough to predict the storms.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said not enough. You need the historical records of storms as well because there is a pattern. You need that pattern and the tides, to correctly predict the timing of the storms. He said it was more than a simple beat. I then turned back and asked, “Are you saying the High Storms are music?” He replied, “I didn’t say they were music. (emphasis on ‘say’). You said that.”

#### Footnote

Questioner's speculation: I figured that was better than a denial or RAFO, so I let it drop.
I am strongly reminded of the Listeners and their rhythms.
