#### Question

How do you come up with names?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He takes a culture then breaks down the linguistics of it and its kind of complicated but he uses the rules from one language, then breaks them and makes his own? He said you can do it on a smaller scale, take a list of baby names from one country or language, and break them into their sounds and rearrange them and make a list where none of the new names are like the ones on the list.
