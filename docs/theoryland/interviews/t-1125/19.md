#### Question

The way he got asked to talk about how he came to finishing the Wheel of Time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He got a voicemail “Hello, I am Robert Jordan’s widow. please give me a call" . RJ had asked her to find someone to finish his books, and after he passed away a friend read Brandon’s eulogy for RJ at the funeral, and the friend told her about his writing, and she read Mistborn then gave him a call. He said it was like winning the lottery but in order to do that your favorite author had to die.
