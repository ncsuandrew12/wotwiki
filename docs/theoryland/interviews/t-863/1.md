When I received my book a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Sanderson offered to answer questions about
*A Memory of Light*
to thank me for not revealing anything. I'm posting them here for you people :). Before you all say "Why didnâ€™t you ask \_\_\_\_\_?!", when I finished the book, it was late at night and I was extremely overtired from reading all night. This is what came to mind at the time. Also, I didn't want to pester him with too many questions so I had decided ahead of time to limit myself to four.
