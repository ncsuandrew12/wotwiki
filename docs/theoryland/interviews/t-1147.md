## [Entry #1](./t-1147/1)

#### scottwo

Breath and Stormlight? (paraphrased)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that the aura of the BioChromatic Breath and Stormlight is very similar. They're two different magic systems, but essentially the same phenomenon.

## [Entry #2](./t-1147/2)

#### scottwo

Nazh?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I also got confirmation from him that Nazh appears in the broadsheets that are scattered throughout the Bands of Mourning. And he's doing something very Nazh-ish.

## [Entry #3](./t-1147/3)

#### Mailliw73

Can an Epic's weakness change?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said so far they have not.

## [Entry #4](./t-1147/4)

#### Mailliw73

I also asked if Kelsier has talked to Marsh since Sazed's Ascension.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I got a RAFO for that one, but Brandon said that this will be specifically addressed in the future, so it's not just a RAFO in case, it will be answered.

## [Entry #5](./t-1147/5)

#### little wilson

Has Odium used the weapon created by Adonalsium's opposition?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #6](./t-1147/6)

#### little wilson

Is the gender of a spren bonded to a surgebinder based on sexual preferences?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not strictly. You're more likely to bond a spren of the opposite gender (or a spren that identifies as the opposite gender since spren have no gender), just like you're more likely, statistically, to be attracted to someone of the opposite gender. There is a correlation between the two but just because a male character has a male spren does not necessarily mean what some think it means.

## [Entry #7](./t-1147/7)

#### little wilson

How many Shards are whole at the time of Shadows of Self?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. Ish. (He's too tired to do math, but he says it's about half-ish).

## [Entry #8](./t-1147/8)

#### little wilson

Are any of the Lord Ruler's descendants alive at the time of Alloy of Law?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #9](./t-1147/9)

#### viridian

My oldest asked if it took a life to create Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No it did not.

## [Entry #10](./t-1147/10)

#### viridian

My younger daughter asked why, if Renarin could see the future, did he say "We're dead"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said this will be explained soon (I didn't remember Book 3 being specifically mentioned but I was distracted, and she swears she heard him say that's where it would be addresseed further).

## [Entry #11](./t-1147/11)

#### viridian

At what point did Renarin hear the Shardblades screaming?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said "Earlier than what was apparent."

## [Entry #12](./t-1147/12)

#### CarolaDavar

If the Storm father were to turn into a blade for Dalinar, would it be bigger than a regular shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO (not because it may be answered, but because he doesn't want to accidentally canonize something).

## [Entry #13](./t-1147/13)

#### CarolaDavar

Do you ever go on the 17th Shard just to see what randomness we do there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not often, but yes.
