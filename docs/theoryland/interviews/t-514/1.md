# [Interview #514: JordanCon: Interview with Wilson Grooms by Richard Fife, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=514#1)

#### Richard Fife

Growing up, James Oliver Rigney Jr., better known as Robert Jordan, had two biological brothers. He also had a third brother, his cousin Wilson Grooms: the fabled "fourth of three". I first met Wilson at JordanCon I, and I was amazed at his openness and candid way of speaking, especially about his brother/cousin. I never had the honor of meeting Jordan, but the times I have spoken to Wilson, both at JordanCons and at the Charleston signing of
*The Gathering Storm*
, have given me a glimpse into who Jim Rigney was. Because of this, I sought out an interview with Wilson so that you could share a bit of that feeling.
