# [Interview #780: London Signing Report - ValMar, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=780#5)

#### ValMar

The organizers had announced rather naively that the event would be from 1pm to 2pm. The signing began at 1.30 and would've lasted at least until 3.30. There was very large attendance and as always Brandon was great and very engaging with everyone.

I am glad that I got to meet him.
