# [Interview #780: London Signing Report - ValMar, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=780#2)

#### ValMar

The only WOT answer of note that I heard related to the possible prequels. Apart from what I already knew, that he would write them if it is decided to go ahead but is very uneasy about the idea, there was one little thing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is particularly interested in the story of Tam.

Later, I also overhead Brandon say that chances are very slim on the books (prequels and/or sequels—couldn't hear which) being written. He is concerned on the commercialization of RJ's name—where can they draw the line if they start with the prequels/sequels?

#### ValMar

For what it's worth, I would love to read about Moiraine and Lan's adventures searching for Rand.
