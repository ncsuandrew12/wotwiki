# [Interview #780: London Signing Report - ValMar, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=780#1)

#### ValMar

A few words on the signing which Brandon Sanderson did today, Saturday, in London. I intended to post it on Tuesday so more people may come across it, and still probably will post it again, then.

I got to the bookstore (Forbidden Planet) late and missed most of the Q & A session at the beginning. Bloody traffic jam!
