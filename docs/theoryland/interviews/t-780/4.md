# [Interview #780: London Signing Report - ValMar, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=780#4)

#### ValMar

I asked him on the difference in Tuon/Fortuona's character we see between
*Knife of Dreams*
/
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Basically, it is to do mainly with her environment whilst with Mat. For the first time she was with someone close to her who she can trust. We know how they do things in the Imperial family. After Thanksgiving gatherings they have to do a roll call for the survivors.

Back amongst the Seanchan she is home to chaos and a totally different situation. She will have much different mindset. Also, in
*Towers of Midnight*
she is dealing with the White Tower—an issue which makes the most placid Seanchan go rabid.

When I pushed Brandon regarding possible involvement of Greandal, he refuted it. Or at least said that if I am "digging" for something—there is nothing I can find. Something to that effect.
