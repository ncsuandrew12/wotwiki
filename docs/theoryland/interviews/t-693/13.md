(laughter) Well, I tell you, that is absolutely awesome, and we really appreciate your time today, but unfortunately we are completely out of time. We're waiting on pins and needles, can't wait to see how this series wraps up.

It is. It really is.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you so much, guys. Thank you for having me on again.
