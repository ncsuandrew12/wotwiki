#### Michael R. Mennenga

Yeah, I can see that, because it is a huge undertaking. I mean, the series is just gigantic. You said that you're using online sources and fan sites, and so forth, just kind of research. I guess you'd absolutely have to. There'd be no way to do this otherwise. Have you got any shout-outs to some of the better ones? Or do they know that you're reading?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah. There are several very good ones. The one I use most extensively is a place called
[Encyclopaedia WoT](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org)
. The 'encyclopaedia' is spelled kind of the ancient way, with an extra 'a' in there somewhere. But anyway, Encyclopaedia WoT, what it's done is it's simply an index. It is an index of every character's appearance and which chapters they're in, with a short summary of that chapter. And that has been invaluable, because you'll have these moments, where you're like, okay I remember these two characters met, what did they say to each other? You can go to those characters' index, find where they are, and then I can go read those scenes from Robert Jordan's books. And so, it's very useful.

[Tarvalon.net](http://tarvalon.net)
also has some very extensive sort of wiki-style articles about the Wheel of Time world that I've used for reference in various instances to help me along. So, those two in particular, but there's a lot of very good Wheel of Time web sites out there. For those looking for a good community,
[Dragonmount](http://dragonmount.com)
is a great place to go to just be part of a community. There's some more recent ones, like
[Thirteenth Depository](http://13depository.blogspot.com/)
, which have some very interesting things going on. The really psycho one is a place called
[Theoryland](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/)
, in which people get around and argue their weird and wacky theories about what's going to happen in the books. And that can be very interesting from my standpoint, knowing what's going to happen in the books, going there and seeing what people are thinking, and hoping for, and wondering about.
