# [Interview #693, Entry #4]: Dragon Page: Cover to Cover Interview](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=693#4)

#### Michael R. Mennenga

Well, first off, we've got to talk about the Wheel of Time, because that's like really, really, really cool.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is really, really, really cool. I'm still a little bit in awe, a little bit surprised every day when I get up and I start working on the Wheel of Time books. I've mentioned this before on interviews, but I started reading the books when I was fifteen, been following them all along. And so, I'm thirty-five this year. And so twenty years of my life, I've been reading these books, and now I'm actually writing on them. It's a really surreal experience.

#### Michael R. Mennenga

It's like the ultimate fanfic wet dream, you know. (laughs)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. I mean, it totally is. There's really no way to describe this. It would be like a science fiction fan getting called by J. J. Abrams and asked, "Hey would you be interested in working on the next Star Trek movie?" Or you know, something like that. It's unreal.
