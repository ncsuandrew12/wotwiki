# [Interview #557: WH Signing Report - Ryan R., Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=557#1)

#### Ryan R.

This actually has no spoilers and is not in and of itself very interesting but since I have heard people speculating about Verin's using a Well back in
*The Great Hunt*
to "Delve" that Ogier, I'll mention it.

#### Robert Jordan

I asked Jordan if you need to channel to detect loss of soul, and he said no, it was obvious from touch. So Verin doesn't have a Well, or at least didn't use it.
