# [Interview #173: COT Signing Report - Sonia Ibarra, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=173#4)

#### Sonia Ibarra

The signing lasted until about 10:30, when Jordan began to remark that he was getting tired and hungry, having not eaten dinner yet. There had been a cake screened with a picture of his face on it, but I don't recall seeing him eat any of it. In fact, the icing with his face on it was still intact, and Jordan remarked that he didn't think he could manage to sign icing. All in all, it was a pleasant evening, and one that netted me a complete set of signed WoT books.
