# [Interview #173: COT Signing Report - Sonia Ibarra, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=173#2)

#### Sonia Ibarra

So the Eye of the World is a Well, right?

#### Robert Jordan

[pauses] Yes and no. It's in the same class of objects as a Well, but on a different scale.

#### SONIA IBARRA

So could it be refilled by a male channeler?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

No. Remember, lots of Aes Sedai died to make it.

#### SONIA IBARRA

To keep it pure.

#### ROBERT JORDAN

That, among other things. Look, a normal Well is like this water glass. [he gestures] The Eye is like a liquid nitrogen canister.

#### SONIA IBARRA

So are Wells made with the opposite half of the Power that they were meant to contain, like Rand did at Shadar Logoth?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

[sly smile] No, they don't work like that.
