# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #135](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#135)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 28)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-twenty-eight/)

I added the white dress—and the paragraphs here—because several women I know complained that they never got to see what Vin was wearing in this chapter. Honestly, women are so strange. A fight for life and death could be occurring, and all they would want to know is whether or not the blood spurting out of the dying men complimented their clothing or not. :)
