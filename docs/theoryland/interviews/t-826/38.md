# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#38)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, and by the way. People often ask me how far ahead I plan my novels. Well, I've noted already in this annotation that some things—such as the Kelsier-Marsh-Mare relationship—come to me as I write. They appear when I need something to fill a particular hole in the story. Other things, however, are quite well planned. Want an example?

Kelsier's warning about not flaring metals too much is a foreshadowing for book three of the trilogy. You'll see what I mean in a couple of years. Also, there's something very important about Vin's brother that will be hard to pick out, but has been foreshadowed since the first book...

#### Footnote

He's talking about Spook, and Ruin's whisperings disguising as Reen's whisperings.
