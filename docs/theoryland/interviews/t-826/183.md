# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #183](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#183)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 38 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-eight-part-one/)

Vin's entrance here is one of my favorite scenes in the book. Short, but very cinematic. It brings together all of the best images in the book—Allomantic pushes, stained glass, swirling mist, and the mistcloaks.

The cloaks are something I really wanted to do. I realize that some readers have trouble imagining them the right way, but I wanted something distinctive for the mistborn to wear. Regular cloaks and capes are nice, but I wanted something that I could make my own, and the multi-layered tassel thing seemed to fit very well with the mist theme.

As I mentioned earlier, I tend to multiply viewpoints near the end of books. Kar's viewpoint here is another one—I knew I wanted to be outside of Vin's head for the entrance here so I could describe it properly. Plus, this let me show how Inquisitors see.
