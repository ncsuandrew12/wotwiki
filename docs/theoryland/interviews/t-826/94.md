# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #94](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#94)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 19 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-ninteen-part-one/)

This book is not a story about the history of the Final Empire or Allomancy. Those things will come in later novels. This is the story of a girl learning to overcome her trust issues, while at the same time the story of a beaten people resisting despite the odds.

However, I did want to give some clues as to the nature of this world and its mythology. The biggest clue outside of the logbook comes in the way that the mists themselves react to someone using Allomancy. They swirl around him or her. This is meant to show that the mists are not something natural. They're more than a weather pattern; they're part of the magic of this world.
