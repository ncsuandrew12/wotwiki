In this chapter, we get our first real information on what it was like to work in the Pits of Hathsin. It wasn't originally planned this wayâ€”I was just going to have the caves here be regular caves. The cracks in the ground, however, clicked with me, as that was what I had planned for the Pits. This made for a much more defensible position, as well as let me explore some of Kelsier's past.
