# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #155](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#155)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Simply destroying the pits probably wouldn't destabilize the economy to the point that some of those here assume. The thing is, atium isn't the foundation of monetary value in the Final Empire—not like gold was in America for a time. It's simply a prime source of income and power for the Lord Ruler. Losing it will be a blow, but not enough to completely overthrow the empire. After all, the Lord Ruler still has his atium cache—and so, as the metal becomes more rare and valuable, he'd become more wealthy through atium inflation.
