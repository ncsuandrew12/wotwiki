# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #168](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#168)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sazed gets a little preachy about belief in this chapter. He is actually expressing my own thoughts on the matter. A belief that is never tested isn't really that strong. Yet, I have other reasons to put this conversation in. Sazed himself is going to be tested a bit in future booksâ€”and I needed him to say these things here so that he could, later on, have to 'put his money where his mouth is.'
