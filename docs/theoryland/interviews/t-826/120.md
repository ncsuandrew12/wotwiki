# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #120](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#120)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 25 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-twenty-five-part-one/)

I hope that pewter dragging doesn't seem like something I just pulled out of my hat. I hate it when authors just suddenly come up with new elements of their magic systems. (See my recent article on how to write magic systems for more.) Instead, I find it better when the characters find new ways to apply what they can already do.

This seems to be a natural outgrowth of pewter to me. Plus, I did need a way to get Kelsier and Vin to the battlefield with some manner of speed. In these books, I've found getting people where they need to be at the right time to be one of the most challenging aspects of the series. In book three, I have one character crossing half the continent, then having to run back the other way, just so he can get where he needs to be for the end of the book.
