# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#34)

#### Brandon Sanderson

We mention the Lord Ruler's flawless memory here. This is actually the only time in the entire series that it's mentioned. However, this is an important clue for later. However, as I'm writing this, without being able to hide this text, I don't want to explain too much and inadvertently ruin something. However, if you've finished the book, you might be able to figure out why the Lord Ruler might have a reputation for being able to remember things.

#### Footnote

Namely, it's because he's a Feruchemist and so can store memories in Copperminds.
