#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 5)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/114/Mistborn-Chapter-Five)

"There's always another secret." That's the unwritten law of this series, by the way. Keep that in mind as you read not only this book, but books two and three. Also, keep in mind that I take no end of delight from doing what people don't expect. (But only in cases, however, where such unexpected events make perfect sense, once they happen.)
