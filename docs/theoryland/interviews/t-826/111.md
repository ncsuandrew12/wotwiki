# [Interview #826, Entry #111]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#111)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Shan's scene here is just another placeholder, I'm afraid. She just showed up to remind you that she's still around, making Vi's life more difficult.

Since I wanted to use her later as an antagonist, I had to make certain you didn't forget who she was. It was important to me that I have another Mistborn in the book that Vin could fight, if only to show off a little of what Vin is capable of. And, of course, I like the fact that I can pull a nice reversal of expectation with Shan.
