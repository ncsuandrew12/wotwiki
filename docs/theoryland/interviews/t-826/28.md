# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#28)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In this chapter we also have the first mention of the Eleventh Metal. I kind of wish that I'd found another place for this, since the chapter is already filled with a long discussion scene. Yet, it proved to be the best place for it in the drafting process.

If you think that what Kelsier is saying here is a little fishy, then you're not alone. Most of the crew doesn't believe him either. I'll certainly admit that there is more going on here—far more—than anyone suspects.

Hopefully, you noticed Clubs's little 'hooks through our throats' line here. That one pops up again, certainly, and it has a nice little relation to the next time we see Camon's lair.

#### Footnote

Brandon wrote a short story about Kelsier learning about the Eleventh Metal in the Mistborn RPG book. Ruin had Kelsier's teacher kill the man who discovered it.
