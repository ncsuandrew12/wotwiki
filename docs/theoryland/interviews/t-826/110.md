# [Interview #826, Entry #110]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#110)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I like the obligator scene in this chapter, as it gives Vin a chance to realize just what the whole obligator system is about. Regular priests watch over the spiritual well-being of their people. The Lord Ruler doesn't really care about that. So, his priests watch over the economics of his empire. Seems like something a living god would do.
