# [Interview #826, Entry #40]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#40)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mistwraiths are a hold-over from MISTBORN PRIME. They did more in that book than they do in this novel, but I thought they were an interesting world element. In fact, in PRIME, the hero fights one. It was a kind of fun scene, as the Mistwraith tried to ingest him. However, I couldn't really see the things being dangerous enough to threaten a Mistborn, so I turned them into more scavengers in this novel.

As I re-read this chapter, I'm realizing just how obvious I made it here that Renoux is a kind of Mistwraith. Maybe I overdid it a bit. One problem with this novel in alpha reads was that many of my readers had also read MISTBORN PRIME, and so they understood the nature of kandra, and immediately knew what Renoux really was. It's not an extremely important surprise, however, so it probably doesn't matter that people can figure it out.
