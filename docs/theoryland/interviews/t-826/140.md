#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 29)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-twenty-nine/)

This is probably my favorite section from the logbook. It really comes together here, weaving in elements from the various epigraphs, making a story out of what the reader has previously only seen in pieces.

I hope this story-within-a-story is interesting to you. It really does have a purpose in the novel, as you'll eventually see. At the very least, I should hope that the concept intrigues you. The past story is, after all, the standard fantasy novel story—the young peasant hero who follows the prophesies to rise up and defeat the dark lord. Except, as you can guess, something went wrong.

Though I try to avoid writing the standard fantasy story, it intrigues me. That's why I wanted to have these epigraphs make reference to the concept. They let me play with what has come before me, without actually forcing my readers to spend all their time reading 'my' interpretation of the same old story. (It seems that every fantasy author has their own spin on this story—yet none of them realize that as a reader, I don't really want to read a new spin on an old story. I want to read a new story.)
