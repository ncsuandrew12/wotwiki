# [Interview #826, Entry #42]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#42)

#### [Brandon Sanderosn (Chapter 8-2)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/119/Mistborn-Chapter-Eight-Part-Two)

n this chapter, for the first time, I straight out mention that plants aren't green. I hoped that this concept would come across in the first few chapters. However, this sort of thing is difficult to enforce in people's minds. The fact that there are NO green plants in the world is something that most people will probably just skip over in their heads. So, I had to make Kelsier aware of the way that things should be, so that he can explain it to Vin, and therefore point out to the reader—in no uncertain terms—how the landscape works.

The other thing to notice is, of course, that there are no flowers in this world. But, we'll get to that later.
