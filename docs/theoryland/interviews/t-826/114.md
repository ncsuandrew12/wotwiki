# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #114](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#114)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 24 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-twenty-four-part-one/)

In this chapter, Vin drinks from a cup someone hands her. It's a very small point—and, since she's been going to balls and the like, I'm sure she's done it before. Yet, I wanted to give a kind of metaphoric nod to how far she's come by having her pause, look at the cup, then drink.
