# [Interview #826, Entry #189]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#189)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Finally, we get to have a nice little scene with Vin and Sazed standing over the body of the Lord Ruler. This is another good metaphoric scene, where he has been cast down by the people he sought to oppress, much as the skaa cheering outside have cast down the empire that sought to oppress them. The rising sun outside, of course, is a nod to this.

And the Lord Ruler dies in the same way that Kelsier did, with a spear in the chest while he's laying on the ground, defeated.
