# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #171](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#171)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 36 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-six-part-one/)

Whew! These annotations just get longer and longer as the book draws to an end. I've got so much to talk about!

The symbolism of the yellow sky here is one of my favorites in the book. This book, obviously, is not going to end with the mists or the ash being stopped. That was Mare's dream. However, I wanted to give Kelsier a kind of symbolic victory in this direction, and so I let the newfound determination in the skaa be his version of changing the sky back to the way it once was. It's not completely the same, but it's the first step.
