# [Interview #826, Entry #57]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#57)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 12 part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/125/Mistborn-Chapter-Twelve-Part-One)

Why do I have the ball scenes in this book? Isn't this supposed to be an action story? Well, the absolute truth is I like party scenes like these.

It's kind of odd. I don't particularly like parties myself, but in books, they add quite a nice contrast to the dark skulking type of activities Vin has been about so far. It's nice to show the lavish side of life in Luthadel. The ball scenes in ELANTRIS were some of my favorite, since they allowed for some relaxed—if important—verbal sparring and witty commentary. So, when I was planning MISTBORN, I knew I had to have some parties at the noble keeps.

So, that meant I had to get Vin to said parties. That meant she had to pretend to be a noblewoman. That's where this whole plot cycle started—with me wanting an excuse to have ball scenes in this book.

#### Footnote

Brandon has mentioned before that he really enjoys Jane Austen books which give you some other influences
