#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 19 Part 2)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-ninteen-part-two/)

This is the only chapter where we get to see directly what Kelsier is going about doing at night. You may think that a thousand manuscript pages is a lot of room to do things in a book, but you'd be surprised. With the focus on Vin's progress, I really can't spend that much time showing Kelsier running about being sneaky. In truth, I think it would get old very quickly.

Yet, one chapter—such as this one—makes for a very interesting break from what we have been doing. It gives us an idea of Kelsier's part in the job without being laborious. Actually, I find this chapter quite fun, since it gives us quite a bit of information in a very short amount of time. Having Kelsier ask about House Renoux, and getting the response, lets the reader know that the crew is safe for the moment. Yet, having Straff ask about the Survivor lets us know that Kelsier's reputation is growing, and that the crew might soon be in danger.
