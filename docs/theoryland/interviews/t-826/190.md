# [Interview #826, Entry #190]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#190)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Epilogue Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-epilogue-part-one/)

This last epigraph is actually out of order. Most of them were chronological as Vin read from the logbook. This one, however, doesn't actually come after the one before it. I just put it here because it felt like it belonged at the end.

I did, actually, write most of these epigraphs (or bumps—or whatever you want to call the things at the beginnings of chapters) in one lump, then cut them apart, as I think I've mentioned. I did the same thing for book two, actually, where there's a different kind of puzzle going on in the narratives.
