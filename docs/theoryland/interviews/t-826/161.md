# [Interview #826, Entry #161]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#161)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 34 Part 2)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-four-part-two/)

Kelsier saving Elend in this chapter was indeed something of a homage to LES MISERABLES. It is one of my favorite classics, and Elend's own character—with his group of idealistic noble friends—was partially inspired by Marius and his cohorts. I wasn't originally going to have Elend in this scene, but I decided to throw him in and give Kelsier the opportunity to save him, partially as an inside reference to the story that inspired him, and partially to let Kelsier do something truly selfless as a final send-off before he died.
