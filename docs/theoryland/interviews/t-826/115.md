# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #115](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#115)

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you hate Spook's dialect, I apologize for this chapter. This is the place in the book where I spent the most time on it. I really like some of the phrases hereâ€”I tried to make the dialect focus on rhythm and sounds, making it alliterative and interesting simply to say out-loud. In case you need it, here's a loose translation of the exchange in this chapter:

Spook: "It's not nice to play with people like that."
  
Kelsier: "Oh, don't worry about what he does to you. He's not worth your concern."
  
Spook: "You're probably right."
  
Breeze: "What are you two babbling about?"
  
Spook: "He wants to be clever. He pushes people around because he wants to prove that he is clever."
  
Kelsier "He's always been like that."
  
Ham "He's insecure. I think he worries that he's really not that clever."
