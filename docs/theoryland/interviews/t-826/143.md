# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #143](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#143)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 30 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-part-one/)

Keep Venture is actually based on real cathedrals. Actually, visiting a few cathedrals was what that sparked the entire structural theme for the buildings in this book. The main inspiration for Keep Venture was the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. I loved the way it incorporated the huge windows at the sides, inset with pillars, with interesting balconies above for viewing. I took that concept and changed it around a bit, turning the worship hall into a ballroom.

After that, the other keeps were easy. Keep Lekal came from the Luxor in Vegas. Hasting and Elariel I came up with on my own—one because I wanted a tower keep, and the other because I imagined a room with stained glass windows in the ceiling.
