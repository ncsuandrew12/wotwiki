#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 23)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-twenty-three/)

Has it been too long since we've seen Elend? I think so. I wish I could have worked him into the story more earlier, then shown him a little more consistently. I promise that you'll see more of him in the upcoming chapters, however.

He's one of the major characters in not just this book, but the entire series, after all.
