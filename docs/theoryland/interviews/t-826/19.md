#### Brandon Sanderson

Dockson, by the way, got his nickname before his real name. I wanted to call a character Dox, for some odd reason. The name just came into my head and stuck. And, I figured that this book would be one where everyone would have nicknames, so I started playing around with Dox until I got Dockson to be the main name.

Of course, because of that, I established that 'son' could end names. Therefore, we get other names in this linguistic paradigmâ€”such Ferson in the second book, or Franson in book three. (Both of those names came from friends of mine.)
