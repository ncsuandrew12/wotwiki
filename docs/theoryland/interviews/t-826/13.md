# [Interview #826, Entry #13]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#13)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/107/Mistborn-Part-One)

Unlike ELANTRIS, where I decided to divide the book into 'parts' after the fact, I always planned this book to be told in several sections. Naming the parts actually came quiet easily to me. Part One is the section where Kelsier gets most of his viewpoint time, and I decided that naming it after him would be appropriate.

In addition, I just like the way that "The Survivor of Hathsin" sounds. A piece of me was sad that I never came up with a good full name for Kelsier. Something like Kelsier Mistshadow or something like that. I tried several, but none of them ended up sounding quite right, and I had to rely on calling him "Kelsier, the Survivor" in those places. That ended up working just fine.
