# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #93](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#93)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The scene with the skaa getting killed in the courtyard was also added later in the drafting process. Moshe was worried that the Final Empire didn't seem brutal enoughâ€”especially in these middle chapters, where it was easy to forget (as Vin almost did) how dangerous the world was. The balls and the frills were supposed to be distracting. However, I realized that I needed to bring people back on-course by throwing in a scene like this, where abject brutality could be contrasted with the night's beauty.
