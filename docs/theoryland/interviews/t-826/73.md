# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #73](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#73)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Part 2 Wrap Up)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-part-two-wrap-up/)

This is one of the shorter sections in the book. Every time I read through the book, I'm surprised at how quickly the ending of this one sneaks up on me. We begin with Vin worried about the first ball she's going to have to attend, go through that ball, then have her infiltrate Kredik Shaw on that very same night.
