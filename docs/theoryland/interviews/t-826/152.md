# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #152](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#152)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is also the chapter where we get the climax of the Pits/atium plot. We finally get to see them first-hand, and see Kelsier go to them and exact his revenge upon them. I worry that I should have foreshadowed this more, pointing out that Kelsier knew of a way to destroy the atium crystals. The problem is, I've left the Pits intentionally mysterious.
