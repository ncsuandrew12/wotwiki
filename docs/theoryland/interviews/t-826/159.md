# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #159](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#159)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Chapter 34 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-four-part-one/)

I realize that some people don't like fight scenes. My hope is that these scenes in the MISTBORN books aren't simply fights. They're expressions of the magic system. If you have invested the effort into learning how Pushing and Pulling metals works, you should be able to get some pretty vibrant visuals out of this fight between Kelsier and the Inquisitor.

Either way, this chapter has my favorite beginning lines (not counting the bumps) of any of them. It's a good, old-fashioned showdown between good and evil! Or, at least, between Kelsier and evil!

Honestly, though, this fight played a good hundred times in my head when I was preparing, then writing, the book. I hope it worked for you. I know it isn't all that long, but coming up with interesting fights that don't feel repetitive, and instead incorporate the setting elements and the majesty of Allomancy is something of a challenge. I really liked how this one turned out.
