# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #100](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#100)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 21 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-twenty-one-part-one/)

You can thank my editor Moshe for the canals in this book. He's a bit of a canal buff, and when he had read through MISTBORN, he excitedly explained to me how canal technology was just perfect for the level of development I had in this book. So, at his suggestion, I changed caravans into convoys, and swapped horses for longboats.

I really like the change. It gets boring seeing, reading, or writing the same old things. So, by getting rid of one standard fantasy element—highways and horses—I think we add something very distinctive to the world.

Moshe, though. Man. He knows TOO much about this stuff.
