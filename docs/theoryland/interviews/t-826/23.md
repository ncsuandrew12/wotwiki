# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#23)

#### Brandon Sanderson

An item of note his in this chapter bump. I mention 'Terris' for the first time here, which I was glad that I was able to do. Remember that name, because you'll soon get a lot more about that country.

I do worry that the bumps will make the book feel a little too much like a standard fantasy. Mention of prophesies and the like has become such a clich√© in fantasy that I avoid them whenever I can. The story in MISTBORN doesn't really deal much with that aspect of the history, but the story that is happening in the bumps has quite a bit to do with it.
