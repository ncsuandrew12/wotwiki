#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 33 Part 1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-three-part-one/)

So, last chapter probably started the official 'Brandon Avalanche™.' However, I think I did a better job in this one than I have in previous books. The pacing here isn't QUITE as much of an 'all at once' as it was in ELANTRIS. Yet, let me warn you. Stuff has started to happen.

It will keep happening.
