# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #170](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#170)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hum, let's see. Anything I'm forgetting? I do mention boxings in this chapter. You might be interested to know (now that you've read pretty much the whole book) where I got the word. In my mind, boxings (the coins) are actually called "Imperials" on the official coffers. However, that was too boring a word.

So, the people call them boxings because they have a picture of Kredik Shaw on the back. The Lord Ruler's homeâ€”or, his box. Boxings.
