# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #136](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#136)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think Vin makes a very important realization in this chapter—that the nobility are a lot like the thieving crews. The more connections like this she makes, the more natural it is going to be for her to go among the nobility. You might have noticed that she doesn't really focus on her act any more. That doesn't mean that it's gone—however, it does mean that she's getting better.
