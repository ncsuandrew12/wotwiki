#### Brandon Sanderson

The Elariel ballroom isn't a place I've ever visited. (Unlike keeps Venture and Lekalâ€”which are both based on real places.) I just liked the concept of a ballroom with the stained glass windows on the roof. It seemed like a good image, especially if it were lit from above. The ballrooms are the only places I really get to show off noble extravagance in this book, and so I worked hard to make each of the four distinctive and visually interesting.
