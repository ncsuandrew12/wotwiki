#### Brandon Sanderson

This chapter has my favorite of Ham's little philosophical dilemmas. Most people I've had read the book don't think much of this argument. It seems obvious to them that resisting the Lord Ruler is the right thing for the people to do. I guess that means I've done my work well, giving the readers a distinct hatred of this government.

And yet, I don't think the answer is that simpleâ€”not for the people living in the world. Ham has a point, in my opinion. Not a big one, but at least one worth considering.
