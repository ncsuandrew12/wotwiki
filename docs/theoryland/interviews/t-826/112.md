# [Interview #826, Entry #112]: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#112)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really like the scene between Vin and Elend here. I think I wrote this one in the car, actually, while I was driving back from a vacation we went on in Palm Springs about two years back. My roommat—Micah DeMoux, the namesake for Captain Demoux—did all the driving on that trip so I could get some writing done. What a great guy. He deserves a character named after him.
