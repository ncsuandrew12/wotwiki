# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #167](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#167)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 35 Part 2)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation-mistborn-chapter-thirty-five-part-two/)

I was forced to cut one of my favorite lines from the book, and it was in this chapter. I'll write it now. Near the beginning, the narrative says regarding Vin:

"She was, as if, nowhere."

Moshe convinced me that this sentence just didn't make enough sense. Yet, to me, it somehow expressed how Vin felt. She had been cut free by Kelsier's death. Yet, she was still there. She wished she could just meld with the mists—she felt as if her soul were already cast away. Yet, she couldn't vanish, as she wished.

Ah, cursed grammar, ruining a perfectly good sentence!
