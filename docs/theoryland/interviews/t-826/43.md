# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#43)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In this chapter, we get to meet Sazedâ€”who ranks as one of my favorite characters in the entire series. (Alongside Vin and someone we haven't met yet.) I like Sazed because he's inherantly conflicted, yet acts so peaceful. He's a member of a servant race, bred to be humble and submissive. Yet, he knows the one who directed all of that breeding is the Lord Ruler. Add in that he seeks to work with the rebellion, yet feels out of place unless he's acting as a servant, and you get a really good character, in my opinion.

Needless to say, you'll be seeing a lot of him.
