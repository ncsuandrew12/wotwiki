# [Interview #826: Mistborn: The Final Empire Annotations, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=826#14)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Chapter 1-1)](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/108/Mistborn-Chapter-One-First-Half)

The 'bumps' or 'trailers' or whatever you want to call them—those things at the beginnings of the chapters—are a very interesting part of the book for me. If you're reading the novel for the first time as you go through these Annotations, I'd recommend paying good attention to what happens in the bumps. This isn't like DUNE, or even ENDER'S GAME, where the bumps give interesting—but tangential—information. These little paragraphs are vital if you want to figure out the climax of the story before it happens.

#### Footnote

Brandon has since decided to call them "epigraphs".
