## [Entry #1](./t-59/1)

#### Austin Sirkin

I recently received a letter from RJ. I'm posting all of the info I think is worthwhile. Have fun!

#### Robert Jordan

I wrote "Jak o' the Shadows" to the tune of "Gary Owen," but I suppose anybody can put the words to what they wish.

## [Entry #2](./t-59/2)

#### Robert Jordan

No, I'm not opposed at all to the idea of a Wheel of Time movie.

## [Entry #3](./t-59/3)

#### Robert Jordan

Wait till the
*Guide to The Wheel*
is out and check a copy. There will be some stuff that isn't in the books. Maps, expansion on some material, historical notes, that sort of thing.

## [Entry #4](./t-59/4)

#### Robert Jordan

The unabridged audio tape should be neat, nifty, and other outdated slang. It will be just what it says: every word of the books. I am talking with the audio publisher about having sections from a male point-of-view read by a man and those from a female point-of-view read by a woman. I think it will make it even better.

## [Entry #5](./t-59/5)

#### Robert Jordan

I'm not signing any books soon, just writing one.

#### Austin Sirkin

I hope this helps you guys out. BTW, anyone know the song "Gary Owen"? Just checking....
