# [Interview #779: JordanCon 2010 - Kristi Deming, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=779#1)

#### Kristi Deming

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I met Brandon on the book signing tour, they gave us a sticky to write what we wanted him to write what we wanted. I am the proud owner of the only copy that says:

"To Kristi, I promise Demandred will be in
*A Memory of Light*
!"

I asked if I was right in thinking that RJ had saved the best for last, and Brandon simply said as far as the Shadow is concerned, the main player will be Demandred.

[long spiel about how Demandred is awesome and sexy and the only Forsaken that has not been killed, captured, or punished]

I said as much to Brandon, saying I expected a RAFO to that. He said that all he could say would be that point would be addressed at a further point in the books.
