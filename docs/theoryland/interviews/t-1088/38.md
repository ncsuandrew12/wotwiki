#### Question

Is there a limit to how many Shardblades one person can have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Theoretically, not really. There are some things that can limit bound that.. I can imagine people have many. In the original draft of
*The Way of Kings*
Prime, Amaram had two. And so, it's definitely possible to have multiples, and I had not thought about someone trying to bond every Shardblade.

#### Question

So that means you can be bonded to more than one spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, those Shardblades are...

#### Question

Dead ones.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. So, can you be bonded to more than one spren? The answer to that question is also yes. Potentially. But there is a much harder limit on that.
