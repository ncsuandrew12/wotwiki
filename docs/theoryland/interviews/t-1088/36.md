#### Question

If you were to use Allomancy to fly faster than light, would it be like the Navigators in
*Dune*
, where you pick out the best possible route through the stars?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, good question though! That's not quite the way, I haven't given you the tools to figure it out, because I feel that the tools you need to figure it out, I couldn't give them to the characters. I wanted it to progress with the technological progress, so hints are only really brief in the story. You will not see a lot of this until the contemporary trilogy, when they are starting to figure out the technology for how this might plausible work out in the future.
