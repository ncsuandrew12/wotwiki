#### Question

What spren types are Glys, Ivory, and Wyndle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, because I haven't decided yet. I know generally what they are, but I don't know how I am going to call them in the books. It happens with other things in my writing, Shards for example - Odium was originally Hatred; the idea was the same, but I decided to change the actual word.
