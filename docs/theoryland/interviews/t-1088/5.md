# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Brandon talked about something he called "Honor's purposes" or maybe "Honor's Purposes," and how they are the reason 10 is such a holy and dominant number - I assumed it meant Honor has (had) 10 of those Purposes. It was heavily implied in the conversation that Odium, if he has similar Purposes, does not have 10 of them.
