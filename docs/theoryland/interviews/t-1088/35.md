# [Interview #1088, Entry #35]: WoR Signing Report - Argent](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#35)

#### Question

The prevailing theory on the 17th Shard is that Hoid worldhops using Shadesmar. Could you confirm or deny that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid has indeed gotten between worlds before through Shadesmar.

#### Question

And would you be willing to give us a hint as to how he does that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are hints in the books. There is a hint in the very first cosmere book I released [
*Elantris*
]. Which I thought was a huge hint, but so far I haven't seen anyone talking about it.

#### Argent

Really?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmhmm. I thought that once people started figuring the cosmere, they would see the massive in-your-face hint I put in that book, but so far, as far as I know, no one has. [Some chat about Brandon's tendency to drop sneaky hints and how he likes doing that] Now, the one [hint] about the map, that one I don't think is obvious. I know people have been trying to figure it out. It's something fun once you figure it out, but it's not something huge and obvious. The
*Elantris*
once was, like, enormously "HIIINT!"
