# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#6)

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Brandon spoke about how he planned all of The Stormlight Archive books to be named after in-world books - that's where the "archive" part comes from. Book #3 will be pretty... unique. He said we'll know what he is talking about when we see it (so I guess it won't be a normal book format or something. Maybe the Shin write their books on stone tablets or something...).
