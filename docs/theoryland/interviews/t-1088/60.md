# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#60)

#### Argent

Shallan has this awesome Memory thing going on, Jasnah has this geolocation thing, Kaladin is a really good fighter - are those just their traits, or is there something supernatural going on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is something supernatural about those. Each Order... Well, how about this. If you look at scholars' interpretations, there are some scholars who think that these things are not supernatural, and some who think that they are. But, if you look, many Lightweavers had powerful mnemonic abilities.

#### Argent

So it's definitely tied to the Orders?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's tied to the Orders. Now, I am not going to say that you've got them all 100% correct, but each Order, there are things that come with Order, things that do not add up from simple the "you get this power plus this power," there is something else going on. And I would say that for Windrunners, watch the number of squires and the power of the squires... these are abnormal for the Windrunners.

#### Argent

And each Order's squires are somehow different from the other Orders'?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeeeaaaa... some Orders do not have them.

#### Argent

But some have more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yea.
