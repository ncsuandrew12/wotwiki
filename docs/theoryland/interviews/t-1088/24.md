# [Interview #1088, Entry #24]: WoR Signing Report - Argent](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#24)

#### Question

I noticed Nazh's name at the bottom of the illustrations - is that a character that's going to make an appearance in the future books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's already appeared in the books. Very very cameo-ish tangential thing, you have to be really looking to spot him.

#### Argent

Books, plural?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wasn't in The Way of Kings, no. Not on screen, I don't think.
