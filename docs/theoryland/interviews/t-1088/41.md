# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#41)

#### Question

Since Hoid is the Horneater god, are there, or at least implied, other Shards...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid is not a Shard.
Question

Or other Shards that are related to Hoid, since they are in the same time period. Would they also be Horneater gods?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think that the Horneaters might interpret things very differently from their reality, as they are viewing things...

#### Question

So would they originally be from Roshar, or would they have traveled from somewhere else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO, it depends on the person. Hoid is not originally from Roshar.
