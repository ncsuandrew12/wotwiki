#### Question

Why can Stormlight heal Lopen's arm, but can't heal Kaladin's scars?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because a lot of the healing in the cosmere works on principles of expectation and how you envision yourself.

#### Question

So Kaladin has accepted the scars.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And Lopen never accepted the one arm. It's one of these ties when I built the magic systems that I wanted certain threads to run through them, so when I eventually have them being used in the same books, there will be consistency among them, so they won't feel like everything's just thrown together. So, the intention and expectation, for instance, in
*Warbreaker*
. What you want to have happen, the expectation, the way you are thinking about things, all that influences what actually happens. Very important for most of the cosmere magics.
