# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#40)

#### Question

Is there a way to tell between different Investitures?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Brandon misunderstood the question a little in the beginning - he thought the question was "can every Shard's magic detect other Investitures?"] Most of the magics have built into them that ability, but I wouldn't say that everyone does. I am trying to remember if all of them have... I lot of them have a power that would allow you to do that, but I don't know if every one of them does.

#### Question

[Clarification]

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you were really good at burning bronze, you could distinguish between different types of Investiture from different planets even. And that sort of skill does exist in other magic systems.

#### Argent

Is it like a wavelength kind of thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yea, that's exactly what it is.
