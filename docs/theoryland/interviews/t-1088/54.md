# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #54](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#54)

#### Question

Can the forms of power of the listeners be treated as opposite / equivalents of the Orders of the Knights Radiant. Could we consider Stormforms to be anti-Windrunners?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You could consider it that way, but there is not a one-to-one analogue.

#### Question

Because it looked like the powers of the voidforms are kind of like anti-Surges...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, yes, there is definitely something there, but again I say, it's not a one-to-one correlation. They are not going to be exactly opposite.
