# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#9)

#### Question

In the last part of the book, Hoid is talking to [a cremling], and says "If you think hard, this sentence is really clever." Are there any implications beyond this, or was that him just talking?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Go compare to another sentence he used earlier in the book. He is making a pun off of the sentence he used before. It's not as clever as he thinks he is, it's kind of a bad pun.
