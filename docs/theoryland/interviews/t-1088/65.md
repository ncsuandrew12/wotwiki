#### Question

The ketek in the first book (Above the Silence, the illuminating storms - dying storms - illuminate the silence above), it seems like this refers to Honor's death.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmhmm.

#### Question

What does "Above the Silence" refer to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Above a silent land.

#### Question

And the second ketek, in
*Words of Radiance*
, similarly refers to the highstorm and the Everstorm... Is there more to it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it's by Navani about the two.
