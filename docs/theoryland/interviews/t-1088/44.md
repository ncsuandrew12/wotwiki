# [Interview #1088: WoR Signing Report - Argent, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1088#44)

#### Question

After a spren has been bonded, what happens if the person it's bonded with dies?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is an emotional event for the spren, but not a damaging one. As long as their oaths are unbroken.

#### Argent

Kind of like if a close friend dies?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe a little more personal than that.

#### Question

I guess Helaran was not bonded to a spren then?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why do you say that

#### Question

I saw that his Blade had a gemstone at the bottom, so that was a clue.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a very good clue.
