#### TheChronicFeruchemist

If I were to Soulcast pewter, the way Shallan does with the blood in
*The Way of Kings*
, would an Allomancer be able to use it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You could create Allomantically viable metals, yes.

#### TheChronicFeruchemist

But is it automatic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say that the pure metals are, but the alloys are not.
