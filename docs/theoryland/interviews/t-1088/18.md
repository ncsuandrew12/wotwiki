#### Question

Are gemhearts, the gems in those chemically identical to mined gemstones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are very similar. Not 100% chemically identical, they are far more pure for one thing. You would call them the same thing, but you would say "wow, this gem has no impurities." They may have flaws, but no impurities.
