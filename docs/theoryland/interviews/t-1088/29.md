#### Question (Paraphrased)

[Comments about how awesome Lopen is.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lopen is a very special dude. I planned, and I don't know if I'll get to it, but I planned an in-between books short story called
*King Lopen the First, King of Alethkar*
. And I am hoping I'll get a chance to write that and stick it somewhere for you guys. Because if you see in the end, he is claiming he was king for a while. You will find out why.
