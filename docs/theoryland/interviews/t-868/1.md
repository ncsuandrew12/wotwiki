# [Interview #868, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: It's finally out.](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm sitting here on a plane, flying to Minneapolis after signing 1280(!) books last night at the midnight release of
*A Memory of Light*
. That marks it as my largest signing ever, though a whole lot of readers (understandably) grabbed their pre-signed books and ran off to read them, rather than waiting for a personalization.

Harriet did a reading, which my good friend Earl filmed (along with the Q&A). I'm sure he plans to post that as soon as the editing is done, and we'll get you a link. I'll be doing many more signings and readings in the coming weeks. (Of special note is the signing in Lexington, where the bookseller wanted me to let you know that he has been able to get Michael Whelan to send prints of the cover of
*A Memory of Light*
. See below this post for details.)
