# [Interview #868: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: It's finally out., Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#9)

#### Terez

There was some discussion about
[Brandon's suggestion](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#2)
that RJ wrote the entire epilogue, since we knew from his
[tweets](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=46#38)
while he was working on it that he had to modify the epilogue material, and we knew from Peter that Brandon wrote the Cadsuane scene (and possibly others; this has never been clarified). In the comments on this post on Facebook, Isabel asked some questions and got some answers from Peter. The last quote is from Dragonmount, in response to some fan assumptions about how much had been written by RJ.

One question: regarding the Cadsuane scene. It is said that this was added by you. Is that correct? Was Cadsuane's fate in RJ's notes?

Team Jordan said I could say that Brandon himself wrote the words of that little scene. Brandon is still being closedmouthed about what specifically came from the notes, but in general, Robert Jordan left quite a few notes on where people ended up at the end of the book.

Am I right to assume that her implied fate wouldn't have been put in, if the notes say something different? (assuming there were notes on it)

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://www.facebook.com/notes/brandon-sanderson/its-finally-out/10151216970237219?comment_id=24910494)

The notes about fates at the end were not contradicted.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/78376-luckers-official-non-spoiler-review/?p=2736943)

What Brandon was given from RJ specifically on the last three books was 200 manuscript pages containing some finished scenes (including the final scene) and some summaries of other scenes, some lines of dialogue here and there, some "I might do this, or I might do this," etc. It's definitely not the last 120 pages of the book.
