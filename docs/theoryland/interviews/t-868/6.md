# [Interview #868: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: It's finally out., Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#6)

#### Question

What about the outriggers? (The sequel trilogy to the Wheel of Time series that Robert Jordan had planned to write.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not going to happen. Harriet and I are both firm on this. Robert Jordan wouldn't have wanted it to happen. He said that he wanted the series to be finished, but he did not want anything more. (He was even uncomfortable with the idea of someone like myself finishing the series.)

Beyond this, at the Q&A on Monday, Harriet revealed something I previously haven't been able to tell you but that I've known for quite some timeâ€”that Robert Jordan didn't leave much of anything in the way of notes for the outriggers. There are, quite literally, only two sentences of explanation from RJ telling us what the plot of the outriggers was to be about.

So no, no outriggers. I highly doubt you will see the prequels either, and for similar reasons. All good things must come to an ending. And this is ours.
