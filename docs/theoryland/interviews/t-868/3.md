# [Interview #868: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: It's finally out., Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#3)

#### Question

Why aren't you coming to my city? And why do you so often go back to the same places?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wish I could get everywhere, but I'm only one person, and touring is rough on the constitution and on the writing. I do try to go new places on every tour, but I also do visit some places repeatedly. This is because certain bookstores and booksellers have supported me since the beginning of my career, when others weren't interested in having me. I feel it important not to skip these stores now that I'm releasing what will likely be the bestselling book of my career.
