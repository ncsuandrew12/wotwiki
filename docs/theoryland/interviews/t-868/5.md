# [Interview #868: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: It's finally out., Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#5)

#### Question

Any news on the Wheel of Time Encyclopedia?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Harriet was asked about this at our signing, and she said that it was well on its way. This is not simply an update of the Guide released way back when, but is a comprehensive encyclopedia. It will contain art, and it will include things from Robert Jordan's notes that didn't make it into the series. (Note that the Waygate Foundation, a charity organization, is running a
[charity drive](http://waygatefoundation.org/)
tied to the Encyclopedia right now.)
