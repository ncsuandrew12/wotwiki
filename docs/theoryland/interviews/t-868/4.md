# [Interview #868, Entry #4]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: It's finally out.](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=868#4)

#### Question

You said something about cover art prints of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes! Brian from Joseph-Beth is one of those booksellers mentioned above. From the start of my career, he's been in my corner, rooting for my books to do well. (And he has probably hand-sold more copies of my books than any person other than myself.) He tends to do awesome things for booksignings. This time, he called up Michael Whelan and asked if he could somehow get prints of the cover to sell.

The result is that we're going to be selling them at that signing, and ONLY that signing. In fact, so far as I know, this is the only place to get prints of the cover painting right now. Mr. Whelan has already signed each one, and I'll be signing them when in Lexington. [
*Assistant Peter's note: Michael Whelan will also sell them on his own website—we'll put up a link later—at the same price ($95), but getting it from Joseph-Beth will be faster. If you're not going to the signing you can order it

. There may also be a few prints of the*
The Way of Kings
*cover painting available at the signing itself*
