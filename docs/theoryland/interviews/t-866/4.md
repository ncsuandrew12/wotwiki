#### Brandon Sanderson

Earlier this year when I went to Chattanooga for a convention, I sat down with
[Derek Pearson](http://derekpearsonproductions.com/)
for
[an interview](http://vimeo.com/55683199)
. It's about 20 minutes long and covers a wide range of topics. There's a tiny bit in there about working on the Wheel of Time, but it's mostly about how I got my start as a writer. Check it out.
