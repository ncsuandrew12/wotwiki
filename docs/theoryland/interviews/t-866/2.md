# [Interview #866, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: AMoL Q&A time change! Also, Waygate Foundation & Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=866#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

One thing among many that I find cool about the Wheel of Time fandom is how much readers like to help other people. There's one group in particular that has taken the idea of being "servants of all" to heart and gotten very involved in charitable activities. The group I'm talking about is called the
[Waygate Foundation](http://waygatefoundation.org/)
, which launched this year (although its members have been involved in charitable giving for years though organizations involved with the big fan sites such as
[TarValon](http://www.tarvalon.net/content.php?126-welcome-to-tarvalon-net)
and
[Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php)
).

Waygate's mission is to support and engage science fiction and fantasy authors and fans in global philanthropic endeavors. Board members include Harriet McDougal, Robert Jordan's cousin/brother Wilson Grooms, and me. Maria Simons is also a director, and the driving force behind the whole thing is Karen Campbell. Waygate's current campaign is called "A Story Begins . . . " and has a goal of raising $10,000 partially for
[Patrick Rothfuss](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp)
's
[Worldbuilders](http://worldbuilders.org/)
charityâ€”exactly the sort of charitable endeavor that Waygate wants to help other writers and fans become involved in. When the campaign's goal is met, Waygate will share a sneak peek at the forthcoming Wheel of Time Encyclopedia that Team Jordan is hard at work on.

For more information, please see
[Waygate's website](http://waygatefoundation.org/)
and
[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/WaygateFoundation)
. I think the way Waygate wants to help writers and fans give back to their community (and beyond) is a great idea, so I hope you will check it out.
