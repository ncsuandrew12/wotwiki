#### Brandon Sanderson

Writing Excuses has three new episodes, finishing off our seventh season.
[Episode 52](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/12/16/)
is another microcasting episode, talking about embarrassing early projects of ours, how to tell if an idea is too big for a particular story, how to avoid discouragement, and how to handle multiple magic systems in one book.
[Episode 53](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/12/26/)
talks about Secret History, which is a type of alternate history where historical events are given fantastical explanations (such as with
*Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
). And the final episode,
[Episode 54](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/12/30/)
, talks about four ways the publishing industry is changing. Next week marks the beginning of season eight!*
