# [Interview #778: TGS Signing Report - gammahunter, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=778#2)

#### gammahunter

My friend asked about his favorite character, Padan Fain, wondering where he has been for the best three books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wanted to include him in
*The Gathering Storm*
. He then said he 'may or may not have been' writing about him on the train ride on the way to the signing!

#### gammahunter

So, pretty much confirmation that Fain will be in book 13! Where do you all think he is? My friend thinks he is posing as an agent from the Dark One and manipulating Taim in the Black Tower.
