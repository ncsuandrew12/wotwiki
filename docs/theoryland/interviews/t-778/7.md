That's pretty much it. The Q&A was short. Mostly people asked about style and the writing process. Brandon seemed awesome. I really liked his speech about how he got to begin writing the books. It was touching. I fortunately did not get Mistborn spoiled for me. I am going to begin reading that this week!
