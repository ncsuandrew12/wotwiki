I asked if Graendal were dead and had she killed Asmodean could he pop back up in Caemlyn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said no. He said that Rand only took Rahvin out of the Pattern for 15 minutes to an hour. So, even if the Choedan Kal were 1000 times stronger than Rand with the fat man it would only be like 9 days at most. More interesting, however, is that he said that we have not seen anyone who could burn someone out of the Pattern that long, however, it was possible for someone to be that strong!â€”Who or what could this be?
