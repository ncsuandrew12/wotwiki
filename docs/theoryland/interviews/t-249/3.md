#### Robert Jordan

He has said previously that he will not write any more books in the WoT universe once he finishes the main storyline, plus the two "outrigger" prequel novels. Tonight, he amended that and said (paraphrase), "I won't write in this universe again unless I have a great idea. Well, I think I have had that idea, but it will take me a while (a year or two) to poke and prod it to see if it is worth writing."
