# [Interview #249: KOD Signing Report - Bluecole, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=249#9)

#### Robert Jordan

The theory that Demandred is using balefire at the direction of the Dark One to loosen the weave of the Pattern is squashed by RJ. (confirmed)

#### Footnote

This person is not clear whether the theory was 'squashed' or 'confirmed', but in any case, we discussed it with Brandon
[here](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#36)
, and it seems as though RJ confirmed it.
