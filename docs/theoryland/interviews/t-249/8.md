# [Interview #249: KOD Signing Report - Bluecole, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=249#8)

#### Robert Jordan

I heard that he has reversed his position on telling us who killed Asmodean (after the paperback of
*A Memory of Light*
comes out). This was NOT confirmed by RJ.

#### Footnote

It was confirmed in previous signings on the
*Knife of Dreams*
tour that RJ would look for a place to include the reveal in
*A Memory of Light*
, and if he was not able to find a suitable place, he would reveal the killer after the release of the paperback of
*A Memory of Light*
.
