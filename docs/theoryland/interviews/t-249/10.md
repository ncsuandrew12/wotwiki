# [Interview #249: KOD Signing Report - Bluecole, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=249#10)

#### Bluecole

Okay, that's all I can remember at this point...more may come to mind after I get some rest. Anything else he said, he said before.

#### Robert Jordan

No male nudity. He will punch the first person to ask who killed Asmodean. No comment on boxers/briefs. However, he didn't go thru the list of pronunciations, kinda a surprise. Did prompt the women for questions.
