# [Interview #594: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Reader Polls + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=594#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There have been a couple of reader polls lately that my books did well in. SFFWorld
[polled its forum members](http://www.sffworld.com/forums/showthread.php?p=626313)
for readers' favorite books of 2010, and
*The Way of Kings*
came out on top, with
*Towers of Midnight*
in second. In addition, Tor.com held a poll to determine
[the best science fiction and fantasy novels of the decade](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/03/best-sff-novels-of-the-decade-readers-poll-results)
, and
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
came in at #9. They've since posted
[an appreciation of the novel](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/03/best-sff-novels-of-the-decade-an-appreciation-of-mistborn-the-final-empire)
by Jason Denzel from Dragonmount.
*Towers of Midnight*
at #11,
*The Way of Kings*
at #12, and
*The Gathering Storm*
at #15 also contributed toward me managing to accrue
[the most votes of any author](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/03/best-of-the-decade-data-votes-by-author)
, spread among seven books. It's a surprise and quite an honor. I'm glad so many people are reading and enjoying the books.

Another poll that's currently ongoing is the
[Locus Poll and Survey](http://www.locusmag.com/Magazine/2011/Issue02_PollAndSurvey.html)
. (Locus is the newsmagazine of the science fiction and fantasy field, and is a fantastic resource for anyone who wants to keep up with the industry.) You don't have to be a subscriber to fill out the survey and vote in the poll, but subscribers' votes count double. None of my books are listed as nominees, but they accept write-in votes.

#### Footnote

It should probably be mentioned that SFFWorld is not an incredibly friendly environment for WoT fans, so most of us avoid it. That probably affects their poll numbers at least a little bit. It's hard to get a scientific poll at any of the fantasy forums because they're all specialized to a point.
