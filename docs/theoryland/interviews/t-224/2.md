# [Interview #224: KOD Signing Report - Erik, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=224#2)

#### Erik

I showed up about 8 or 8:15, and the place had cleared out, there was no line so I walked right up to him at the table where he was signing.

I arrived the same time as his wife/editor Harriet (I assume it was her, black hair with a shock of white hair in the front; RJ asked her if she'd found an Indian place for dinner, so I leaped to the Harriet conclusion).
