# [Interview #224, Entry #1]: KOD Signing Report - Erik](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=224#1)

#### Erik

Alright... I'm going to the Bailey's Crossroads Signing tomorrow evening... will anyone else from here be there? I'll be the guy with the shaved head and the teal backpack with all the patches on it, and I'd love to meet some of y'all if y'all will be there.

Also, I'm planning on asking if Verin is a former librarian for the Thirteenth Depository (if that hasn't already been asked and RAFOed)... someone let me know? And if there are any questions that people think need to be asked, I'll try to get to them. I have four books that need signing and a friend with at least one.
