# [Interview #225: KOD Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=225#4)

#### Robert Jordan

On this "outrigger" trilogy, as he called it, where he might revisit the WOT universe for some books that don't involve the main characters we know, he was hesitant and said it's something he's just mulling over for now. He doesn't know when he'll get to the other prequel short novels, either, but at least whenever that happens it will be after the next book is finished. A WOT encyclopedia is next then, followed by that Infinity of Heaven seriesâ€”he called it a trilogy, for whatever that's worth.
