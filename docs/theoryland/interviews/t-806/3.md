# [Interview #806: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Interviews + Updates, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=806#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There have been a number of interviews posted recently. First off, Suvudu put up a video where Christopher Paolini and I
[interviewed each other](http://youtu.be/LX-_3AEtH_c)
this past weekend at Comic-Con International in San Diego. (With a cameo by Robin Hobb.)

#### Footnote

This is a great interview that gives you a good idea of Brandon the person rather than Brandon the writer.
