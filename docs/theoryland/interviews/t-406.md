Much thanks to everyone who has pointed out to me that the
[Mistborn Two Audiobook just hit Audible](http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_AREN_000919&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes)
. The trilogy is finally complete in this format; I apologize that it took so long to get them all up there.

*A Memory of Light*
revision work is moving right along. I'm afraid there's not much that is interesting to report. What I'm doing right now is probably the most boring part of a revisionâ€”line editing. I'm going line by line, trimming the fat, making it more readable, cutting the passive voice, making the scenes more visual, trying to cut out redundancy. There is a LOT of material here that I'm working with. It shouldn't be long before I'm back to writing new scenes, however. Probably next week or the week after.

Tor is readying a press release about the release date of the book. I suspect you'll see that next week as well. Watch Tor.com and Dragonmount; I'll link it here when it goes live as well.

If you didn't see the
[Mistborn Two deleted scenes](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/768/New-Annotation-and-Deleted-Scene)
, you might find them curious. Go
[drop by my forums to discuss](http://www.timewastersguide.com/forum/index.php?board=14.0)
.

And, in parting,
