## [Entry #1](./t-67/1)

#### OMNI Muse

We're glad to have you here! I've got lots and lots of questions, and I'd like to ask you to briefly tell us about Wheel of Time before we get started. :)

#### Robert Jordan

It can't be done! Not briefly. This is Loial's country. :) I can't even do it in two or three pages. My advice is to read the books. :) And start with
*The Eye of the World*
, please. :) It works much better that way.

#### OMNI Muse

LOL! Okay, we have lots of fans out there, so let's get to the questions.

## [Entry #2](./t-67/2)

#### Shosh001

Mr. Jordan, you've outdone yourself with
*A Crown of Swords*
. My question concerns the True Power. How is it distinguishable from the One Power?

#### Robert Jordan

It's fairly self-evident from the book. What can be done with the True Power is very similar to what can be done with the One Power. Except that where the One Power is drawn from the True Source and is the force that drives the Wheel of Time and powers the universe, the so-called True Power is drawn from the Dark One. There are limits in the same ways there are limits to the One Power. It would be very long if I went into it too much, but some of those limits and costs of drawing on the Dark One are shown in
*A Crown of Swords*
.

## [Entry #3](./t-67/3)

#### JJVORSmith

Can gateways be created at non-right angles to the ground? If not, why not? If yes, why haven't we seen them?

#### Robert Jordan

They can be, and you haven't seen it because there's been no need to do it. And also some of the people who can make gateways don't know how to do it.

## [Entry #4](./t-67/4)

#### DaveB62

How do you explain Liah being in Shadar Logoth for so long?

#### Robert Jordan

She became absorbed into the city. She was left there and she is, after all, a Aiel, one of the people better at surviving under harsh circumstances than anyone else in the world. And also her corruption by Shadar Logoth gave her
*some*
protection.

## [Entry #5](./t-67/5)

#### Rog in CT

Because the Wheel of Time contains the Dark One's prison, and the Ages repeat with each revolution, then isn't humanity itself also imprisoned....unable to truly evolve?

#### Robert Jordan

No. :)

## [Entry #6](./t-67/6)

#### Ellisande

*Cuendillar*
grows stronger when the One Power is directed into it, but can the One Power be drawn out of it, causing it to break?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out! :) That's something I may or may not use in a future book, but it's information that I don't want you to have yet. And that's the reason why I say "Read and find out" when I say it. :)

#### Footnote

Later hints suggest that it is the True Power causing the seals to break.

## [Entry #7](./t-67/7)

#### Atmakeepr

Will we learn what happened to Jain Charin "Farstrider" after his disappearance?

#### Robert Jordan

Possibly.

## [Entry #8](./t-67/8)

#### Belsamar

OK. Let's see if this works. Hello, RJ. Just out of curiosity, do your predictions (Foretellings and Min's viewings) have a well, Delphic quality by accident, or by choice? And did you ever think of writing a copy of
*The Prophecies of the Dragon*
?

#### Robert Jordan

There's very little in the books that's by accident—very little...and no, I've never thought of writing out the complete
*Prophecies of the Dragon*
. As already stated in a previous book, they would comprise a volume of some 300 to 400 pages.

## [Entry #9](./t-67/9)

#### Shosh001

Mr. Jordan, can you tell us why Tor is sending you on tour for the
*Fallon*
series later this year, but not for
*A Crown of Swords*
?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, it was a very short time between handing in
*A Crown of Swords*
and its publication, and in fact, they weren't really sure when I'd finish so they couldn't make arrangements in advance. There's a possibility that the
*Fallon*
tour may be extended to encompass some of what we call
*A Crown of Swords*
territory.

## [Entry #10](./t-67/10)

#### JJVORSmith

My wife wonders why you left all the plot threads hanging at the end of
*A Crown of Swords*
. I have felt that
*A Crown of Swords*
is more like the middle of a book rather than a complete book by itself. Could you explain how you pace and structure your books in the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

Not inside the time we have for this interview! :) As with all of the books, there are some plot elements hanging and some resolved. In some, there are more plot elements tied up than others; some, fewer. It just depends on how the story line is running in that particular book.

## [Entry #11](./t-67/11)

#### Rog in CT

All of Min's viewing have come true except one. Does this mean she is no longer infallible?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it doesn't. And actually, that's not quite true, that all of her viewings have come true but one.

## [Entry #12](./t-67/12)

#### LewsTher1

What was the process through which
*cuendillar*
was made?

#### Robert Jordan

Entirely too complex for me to go into here. If there's anyone out there who can channel on the level of a Forsaken I would be happy to enter into a correspondence with them on the making of
*cuendillar*
. :)

## [Entry #13](./t-67/13)

#### CMore102

Since there are currently Wheel of Time card games and video games in the works, what other media will we see in the future? Comic Books? Films?

#### Robert Jordan

I really don't know. I just take it as it comes. There will be a line of Wheel of Time fantasy clothing and jewelry. There's a company that wants to make Wheel of Time weapons—swords, etc., but nothing in the way of games that I can discuss.

## [Entry #14](./t-67/14)

#### AaronB20

Can you clarify who can tell when one is using the True Power?

#### Robert Jordan

No one can tell if you're using the True Power except the Dark One, of course.

## [Entry #15](./t-67/15)

#### OMNI Muse

Folks, I'm getting some questions about how to contact Robert. You can send e-mail to his publisher at torbooks@panix.com and they'll forward it to him. Please do
*not*
send your manuscripts. :)

#### Robert Jordan

You can also reach Tor by snail mail at Tor Books, 175 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10010, and if someone sends e-mail to me via Tor, please include a snail-mail address, because I don't send e-mail back (I'm not set up for it). :)

## [Entry #16](./t-67/16)

#### Ellisande

Will you be doing any book signings in New England?

#### Robert Jordan

As for book signings in New England...I don't know. That's entirely up to Tor. I go where I'm sent, pretty much.

## [Entry #17](./t-67/17)

#### Rog in CT

There is a mystery man who helps Rand in the last chapter of
*A Crown of Swords*
, my question is this: a new character, or have we seen him elsewhere?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, we've certainly seen him earlier in
*A Crown of Swords*
. Otherwise, read and find out. :)

## [Entry #18](./t-67/18)

#### Firifly

Considering that WoT is such a success, after you have finished this series, can we look forward to anything more coming from this world, past or future?

#### Robert Jordan

Not unless I think of something that I particularly want to write, a story I very much want to tell. At the moment, I plan to do another fantasy novel in another universe. I'm working on that already in the back of my head and have been for a couple of years.

## [Entry #19](./t-67/19)

#### Spind1e

What did Rand see in the sky in the alternate world in
*The Great Hunt*
? (Shadowspawn don't use sho-wings, and Forsaken don't need them.)

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. :)

## [Entry #20](./t-67/20)

#### AaronB20

Did your interaction with fans lead you to make certain things previously hidden obvious in this book?

#### Robert Jordan

No, not interaction with fans. There are always things that are going to become more obvious as the story goes along. I certainly don't intend to keep everything hidden until the very last. There won't be any Perry Mason revelation scene where all the characters sit down and say, "This is what happened and this is why it happened." :)

## [Entry #21](./t-67/21)

#### Gaul Aiel

Will the next book take as long as
*A Crown of Swords*
to be released?

#### Robert Jordan

Probably...I am due to deliver it in the fall of next year which means it will come out probably in the spring of the year following that. I decided writing the books more slowly was better than falling over dead. :)

## [Entry #22](./t-67/22)

#### Scandium2

How much longer do you anticipate the series will go on? I have heard ten, but is anything definite yet?

#### Robert Jordan

It will be at least ten books, yes. There will be some more books, not too many, and please God, not so many as I've already written. I am, in truth, writing as fast as I can. I want to maintain the pace of the story until I reach the final scene, which has been in my head since before I started writing
*The Eye of the World*
.

## [Entry #23](./t-67/23)

#### Seraph23

First off, I'd like to say thanks Mr. Jordan for providing my family and I countless hours of reading enjoyment, and I'd like to ask you something about the Aiel, well, who are they?

#### Robert Jordan

You're welcome. And they are the descendants of the pacifists who were in service to the Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends. If on the other hand, you mean the source of the culture...in my mind, they contain some elements of the Apache, some of the Zulu, some of the Bedouin, and some elements of my own including that I rather liked the fact of making the desert dwellers blue-eyed and fair instead of the usual dark-eyed, dark-complected desert people.

## [Entry #24](./t-67/24)

#### BHeins1

According to several of AOL's members in our discussion forum, you stated at a Balticon conference that Verin Sedai had never held the Oath Rod, or had circumvented the Oaths. I was wondering if that was true, and if so, has Cadsuane also done so?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I did
*not*
say that Verin had never held the Oath Rod. Cadsuane has also held the Oath Rod.

## [Entry #25](./t-67/25)

#### OMNI Muse

I was at Balticon and I was quite impressed by your Guest of Honor speech and your commitment to literacy.

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you, Muse! :)

## [Entry #26](./t-67/26)

#### Sarpeshka

Mr. Jordan, how do you come up with names for characters in your stories?

#### Robert Jordan

I have a huge list of names. Whenever I see an interesting name I jot it down. I almost never use the name as it is, though. I change it.

## [Entry #27](./t-67/27)

#### StuuuuBush

Was Mat right about the "snakelike" guy being a
*gholam*
, and if so, are we to assume that the bad guys are going to have as much trouble stopping one as the good guys?

#### Robert Jordan

I guess he was right. Because after all, his source for the information was Birgitte, who has some memories of the War of the Power. And yes, if a
*gholam*
decided to turn against one of the Forsaken, the Forsaken would certainly have as much difficulty in stopping the attack as any other person would. They were, after all, created for the sole purpose of assassinating Aes Sedai.

## [Entry #28](./t-67/28)

#### SCLaCore

Which of the books is he most satisfied with?

#### Robert Jordan

I couldn't really say. I try to make each book better than the preceding book and frankly, once I have written a book, I stop thinking about it. My mind is focused on the next book, to the extent, actually, that when I came back from turning in
*A Crown of Swords*
, though I intended to take a short vacation, I found myself sitting at the computer and working on the next book.

## [Entry #29](./t-67/29)

#### Scotty1489

Are any of the characters based on real people?

#### Robert Jordan

No, not really, except that all of the women have something of my wife in them.

## [Entry #30](./t-67/30)

#### OMNI Muse

Robert, we're getting questions about cover art. Do you get to choose the artist? The theme?

#### Robert Jordan

I choose the them...the theme, that is, and I give the cover art a general idea of the scene that I want. But then it's worked between him and the art department in NY. I do have some input and I have managed to get a few things changed to some degree. Rand, for instance, in the earlier books, was shown as no more than 5'-10" or 5'-11", and he is about 6'-5", in my eyes.

## [Entry #31](./t-67/31)

#### Rog in CT

Rand recovered very quickly from his dual Healing. Is this because of the way men Heal or because of the Warder bond or both?

#### Robert Jordan

Partly the Warder bond and partly the kind of Healing that was used on him. It should be obvious that Damer Flinn has discovered the same method of Healing that Nynaeve uses and of course, he still is not completely Healed, remember.

## [Entry #32](./t-67/32)

#### Question

What is going to happen with Elayne, Min, Rand and Aviendha in their relationship? Will they all get along?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out! (he chuckled richly)

## [Entry #33](./t-67/33)

#### Argive000

Mr. Jordan, I want to inform you that a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame has just completed a thesis on the rebirth of philosophy in literature centered around your Wheel of Time series.

#### Robert Jordan

That's very nice to know. I've had several people send my copies of their master's theses and other undergraduate theses, comparing me to Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. It's enough to swell my head. Luckily, my wife takes care of that little problem. ;)

## [Entry #34](./t-67/34)

#### BIG TX MA

Mr. Jordan, will we find out more about the Snakes and Foxes in future books?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out! ::stage direction: Phantom of the Opera: Laughter from offstage::

## [Entry #35](./t-67/35)

#### OMNI Muse

Folks, Robert is going to be able to stay with us until 11pm ET tonight! Thanks for the wonderful questions!

## [Entry #36](./t-67/36)

#### Anastin B

Good evening Mr. Jordan. I was wondering if you were plaining on doing, or letting someone do, a companion book for the Wheel of Time?

#### Robert Jordan

There is an illustrated guide to the world of the Wheel of Time in the works. It is planned to have 64 color illustrations and 80,000 words or so of text and it will include a good bit of information that I did not intend to put in the books. There will be a map of the entire world in the illustrated guide. I don't have an estimated publication date at this time.

## [Entry #37](./t-67/37)

#### PaidonF

Does using the Oath Rod shorten one's lifespan?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. :) You guys have to know by now that I like to leave you hanging if I can!

## [Entry #38](./t-67/38)

#### BHeins1

I was just wondering if you have read the FAQ compiled by many of your fans. If so, how would you evaluate its accuracy?

#### Robert Jordan

It's been about a year since someone's sent me a copy of the FAQ. At that time, the proportions were running pretty much the same as the early ones I'd seen: about a third are right, a third are almost right, and the rest are blue sky. In fact, there have been some arguments over things I'd thought I'd made clear. (Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? Bela knows!)

## [Entry #39](./t-67/39)

#### Nature102

On the discussion boards in the SF/F area, one of the hottest topics of debate is the question of who killed Asmodean. Can you shed any light on the subject?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes...but I won't. ;) Read and find out!

## [Entry #40](./t-67/40)

#### Scotty1489

Is our earth a future or past turn of the wheel?

#### Robert Jordan

Both. The characters in the books are the source of many of our myths and legends and we are the source of many of theirs. You can look two ways along a wheel.

## [Entry #41](./t-67/41)

#### Shosh001

How do you explain the longevity of the Kin?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out! :) The clues are there.

## [Entry #42](./t-67/42)

#### JJVORSmith

There's been some question about how the Aiel sustain their vast numbers east and west of the Dragonwall. How can millions of Aiel live on grubs in the Waste and why don't they scavenge the land clean in Illian, Cairhien, and Caemlyn?

#### Robert Jordan

They can live in the same ways that the Bedouin manage to live in a desert where you or I would die, and the Apache did so. They make very efficient use of what they find. And if they stay in one place for too long in too great a number they would indeed strip the land bare. But there certainly aren't millions of them in Illian.

## [Entry #43](./t-67/43)

#### Dragon9150

What happens to Birgitte if the Horn of Valere is sounded again?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out, my children, read and find out. :)

## [Entry #44](./t-67/44)

#### Crypticis

Have you ever thought of writing the
*Travels of Jain Farstrider*
?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

## [Entry #45](./t-67/45)

#### OMNI Muse

Folks, I have hundreds of questions still in the queue, but our time with Robert is almost up.

## [Entry #46](./t-67/46)

#### MHAJEK13

Any chance of producing a "what has happened already" update, either in the next book or maybe as a seperate piece?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, let's see, it would probably take—if I made it as short as I could—three volumes. I don't really think so. :) I'm afraid you're just going to have to read the books. Sorry about that.

## [Entry #47](./t-67/47)

#### OMNI Muse

Thanks so much for being here with us tonight, Robert!

#### Robert Jordan

Thanks for having me! I enjoyed it! It was a pleasure!

#### OMNI Muse

The log of this conference will be available for download tomorrow afternoon at Keyword: OMNI > File Libraries (in the scrollbox) > Conference Log Library.

Robert will be joining our hosts OMNIFlame and OMNI Siren for a few minutes over in the OMNI SF/Fantasy room where the discussion of the Wheel of Time series will continue. We hope to see you there!
