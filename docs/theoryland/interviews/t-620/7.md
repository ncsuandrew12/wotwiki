# [Interview #620: Literatopia Interview, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=620#7)

#### Literatopia

The focus of the Mistborn trilogy and of
*Warbreaker*
is on lived faith and various deities. What do these topics mean to you and why did you choose to deal with them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm very interested in the concepts of religion and the ideas that surround it, and I often find myself writing books that deal with things I'm interested in myself. I allow the themes of books like these to grow naturally out of the world I've built and out of the stories that I want to tell. Specifically, I kind of let the characters decide what the themes of a book are going to be. I don't go into it saying, "I'm going to write about this," but the worlds that I create betray my own interests very strongly. What is it about faith and deity? This is something that is unique about us as human beings, something very interesting to me, and it felt like this area was an open space to explore in fantasy in ways that hadn't been done before. I always find myself gravitating toward things that I feel haven't been explored as much as they could have been. That interests me and fascinates me.
