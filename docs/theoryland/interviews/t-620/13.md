# [Interview #620: Literatopia Interview, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=620#13)

#### Literatopia

Who's your personal favorite in The Wheel of Time and why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably Perrin. Growing up I identified most with him, and in many ways he's the character most similar to me. But when I'm writing, when I'm in a character's head, that character is the most important in the book. They're all my favorite when I'm writing themâ€”that's just the way it has to be as a writer.
