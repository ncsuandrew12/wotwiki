#### Literatopia

Dalinar is Alethkar's military leader fighting for unity between humans. What else can you tell us about this character? Can he be compared to any of your previous characters or is he a completely new creation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In my mind, all of my characters are unique individuals with their own experiences, hopes, and ways of thinking. The character who became Dalinar actually began life back in the very first novel I started writing when I was a teenager. He's the aging warlord, the man who was a bloodthirsty berserker in his youth but is now beginning to question his society's concept that war is an end unto itself. I have always had a firm sense of him in my mind, and I've been saving him for the right book.
*The Way of Kings*
is where he fits.
