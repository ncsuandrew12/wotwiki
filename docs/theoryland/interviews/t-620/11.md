#### Literatopia

How would you describe the Mistborn trilogy to readers who haven't read anything about Vin and Elend yet? Do you think there is some specific detail that makes these novels what they are?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The basic concept is, "What happens after the hero fails?" If you've read fantasy books before, you know the storyâ€”a young peasant rises from obscurity with a faithful band of companions to challenge a great evil. In those stories, the hero always wins. But the world of Mistborn takes place a thousand years after the hero was defeated. The Lord Ruler is an immortal who has proven time and time again he cannot be killed and who rules the world with an iron fist. Instead of trying to kill him, a group of downtrodden thieves plan to battle his empire by stealing enough money to bribe his soldiers away from him. That's how the story begins.
