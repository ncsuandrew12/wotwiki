# [Interview #620: Literatopia Interview, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=620#9)

#### Literatopia

The covers on the German first editions are kept a lot simpler than those of the American originals. Do you get to have a say in the cover design? Do you generally like the motifs or are there some you honestly dislike?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I generally like them. There are some that I'm less fond of; there are some that I like more. I haven't ever been terribly fond of the
*Alcatraz*
covers in the U.S. I actually think that the German covers of the
*Alcatraz*
books are much stronger. Those would probably be my least favorite of them all, but in general I really like what artists are doing and how they're working to interpret my worlds.

It's nice to see, as a writer, someone taking what you've written and envisioning it in a sometimes new and different way, making something cool and creative out of it. So I'm generally very pleased. It's very cool to see how different cultures and different publishers react to the same text and the different types of stories that they convey just through the pictures they put on the front.
