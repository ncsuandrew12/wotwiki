What makes the series about the Dragon Reborn so special in your eyes? Are there some strengths and also weaknesses you want to highlight? What kind of readership would you recommend it to?

One thing that seems to set the Wheel of Time apart from many other fantasy series is how it appeals to people across so many demographics. It has adventure to appeal to teenagers, but when you grow up you appreciate the series for different reasons. The subtlety of the character interactions and the foreshadowing, the intricacy of the plot, the strong women who don't judge themselves by their relationships to menâ€”this series has it in spades.
