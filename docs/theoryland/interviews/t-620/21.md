#### Literatopia

What can we expect from you in the near (and far) future? Do you have any specific plans or are you still waiting to be inspired for further work?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've always got things in the works, but to announce them this is probably not the forum or the time to announce them. People can watch my website. I'm very excited that the new Mistborn book,
*The Alloy of Law*
, is coming out in November. And of course I'm working on the last book of the Wheel of Time, which will be released sometime in 2012. Beyond that? I'm pretty busy with the things that I've put on my plate, so perhaps I will stay away from teasing people with things that are years and years off.
