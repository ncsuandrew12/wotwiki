#### Reader's Question

*Warbreaker*
features a wonderful system of magic. How did you come up with it? And will you tell us your favorite color?

In
*The Well of Ascension*
I had to come up with a bunch of different religions for Sazed to study. One he mentions in chapter fifty revolves around color. It was such a fascinating idea that I decided to weave it into
*Warbreaker*
. The Awakening system uses color as both a cost and a benefit; using Breath drains color, and holding Breath increases perception of color. Awakening itself grew out of a common concept in tribal and shamanistic magic.
