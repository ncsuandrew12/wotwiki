# [Interview #620: Literatopia Interview, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=620#20)

#### Literatopia

Is there a particular interview question you've been waiting for all these years and no one's ever asked it? If so which one is it? What would be your answer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not that I can really think of. The ones I always anticipate are the ones that I can't really answer, so in some ways I'm glad that people don't ask me them, because I always hate RAFOing peopleâ€”RAFO is something Robert Jordan always used to say, standing for Read and Find Out. I do usually anticipate questions about Adonalsium and the Cosmere, which goes into the connected nature of the books that I've been writing, but I won't say that I'm eager to have people ask those questions, because I can't really answer any of those.
