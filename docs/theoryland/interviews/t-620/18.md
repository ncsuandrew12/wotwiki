#### Literatopia

How do you go about writing a new novel? Do you use memos, character profiles and plot outlines or do you just sit down and let the story unfold as you go?

#### Brandon Sanderson

George R. R. Martin has talked about how writers are often "gardeners" or "architects." Gardeners guide a story's growth as they write, and architects plan everything out ahead of time. Now, most writers are really some combination of the two. I am an architect in many aspects of my writing, but with my characters I'm more of a gardener. I extensively design the world and outline the plot before I start writing, but when it comes to character motivations and histories, I often discover those while I am writing.
