# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#29)

Do the WoT eBooks include proper italics and chapter icons?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22726245066215424)

I'll let you know. I'm not using them yet (I'm using converted Word files) but I've asked for them.

Ha. I love bureaucracy. Me to Tor: Hey, I need the wot ebooks. Tor: Just buy them and we'll reimburse you. It's easier that way.

You should tell Tor that you need the audio books too. It would be a shame to pass up free books lol.

I already have those. Got them from Tor back when I started on this project. :)
