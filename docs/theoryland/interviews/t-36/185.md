# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #185](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#185)

Has any recent progress been made on the WoT movie?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136152458232729602)

There was a script done this summer, but it went to revisions.

Do you see WoT making its way to a video format like
*A Song of Ice and Fire*
? Or did that show hurt its chances?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136153903220789248)

I hope that show increases the chances. But we shall see. It's not impossible, but a feature is more likely.
