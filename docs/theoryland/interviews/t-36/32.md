Did RJ specifically state in his notes that the three Aiel Dreamwalkers were clueless about the 'breaking of the seals'?

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/22741806248628224)

I ask, because those same three Aiel Dreamwalkers are implied to know the final use of
*Callandor*
early in the series.

Before I reply, expand on that question, if you will. Humor me.

It's Amys, Bair, Melaine reactions to Egwene's words in
*Towers of Midnight*
Chapter "A Vow" (Egwene POV) I'm wondering about.

Quotation: "but his words were those of madness. He said he is going to break the seals on the Dark One's prison."

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/22761723895218176)

Amys and Bair both froze. "You are certain of this?" Bair asked. "Yes."

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/22762071552696320)

"This is disturbing news," Amys said."We will consult with him on this. Thank you for bringing this to us."

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/22762752325980160)

My question is if all the Wise One sit around the Heart of the Stone, repeatedly, and look at
*Callandor*
.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/22763199036137472)

Should not the Wise Ones have knowledge about the breaking of the seals? They already know about
*Callandor*
's use.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22765481039499264)

I'll say this. RJ's writing, notes, and outline were very present in that entire sequence. Much less Brandon there.

#### Footnote

Felix is a little notorious for being insane, so don't worry if you don't get it.
