When I was younger, I found the Siuan/Bryne side plot distracting. Now it's one of my favorites. Odd, that.

It might go back to the fact that, having the ending of the series in hand, I no longer feel anxious about waiting for an ending.

As RJ matured as a writer, the depth of romantic relationships grew. Mat/Tuon and Siuan/Bryne are more complex than earlier romances.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58609015902576641)

Not that I mind some of the early ones. Simple is sometimes good too. But it is a shift I've noticed in the books.

I dunno—Nynaeve/Lan was done in much the same manner as Mat/Tuon. And is anything more complex than Moiraine/Thom?

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/58610009747099648)

From their very first scene together, there was sexual tension. Read where Moiraine speaks of knowing the face of the man...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/58610216459186176)

...she will marry, or when she tell Thom she will show him not all Aes Sedai are bad in
*The Shadow Rising*
. The subtlest of romances...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58610500392583168)

Maybe complex is the wrong word. Nynaeve/Lan was very well done. But it also wasn't in the forefront.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58610643124760576)

Also, they both fell in love quickly and and easily—there are just lots of obstacles.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/58610984507555840)

True. Though the scene where Rand over-hears Nynaeve and Lan in
*The Eye of the World*
breaks my heart every time.

Rand/Elayne and Gawyn/Egwene hardly spent any time together before declaring undying love.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58610924881317888)

You hit on the two basic ones that sometimes I feel lack depth in the early books.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58611042447663104)

Of course, you could argue this has to do with the age of the participants more than anything else.
