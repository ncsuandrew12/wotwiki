# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #197](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#197)

#### Dave Ainaire

The time warp that Tam al'Thor went through in
*Towers of Midnight*
was a bit disconcerting (time sync between chapters and different threads). Are you at liberty to say whether there will be any similar issues with plot lines in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Peter Ahlstrom

People are pretty much all caught up with each other at the end of
*Towers of Midnight*
, so it shouldn't be a problem. Mat is like three days behind. Black Tower may be further behind. But I doubt there will be any characters who seem to be in two places at the same time.

#### Footnote

Mat is probably not three days behind, since he left for Ghenjei on the same day that Perrin left for Merrilor, which was the day before the scheduled meeting.
