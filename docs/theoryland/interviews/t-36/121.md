This Thom scene in
*The Shadow Rising*
chapter 17 is an absolute gem of writing. Wonderful characterizations, excellent motion, powerful reversals.

Guys, when I talk about how to write a great scene, THIS is what I mean.

Notice that the Siuan mentions that the Blight is retreating in this chapter. Hmmm... Wonder why...

I remember reading somewhere that some think this was an effect of the Eye of the World's usage. Hmm...

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

Brandon is probably hinting here that it rather has something to do with the Fisher King prophecies.

Thom, speaking of how future ages may see him: "Not a gleeman—but what? Not eating fire, but hurling it about like an Aes Sedai..."

Will you believe that, in my youth, it wasn't until around that moment that I caught the Thom/Merlin connection?

#### [OWENSMTO](http://twitter.com/OwensMTO/status/48850330116571136)

Don't feel too bad. I didn't catch the Mat/Odin connection until very recently. And Perrin is Thor, it seems. heh.

I believe there's actually a Slavic god of the forge named "Perun" or something along those lines.

#### [NATHAN ANDRUS](http://twitter.com/monkeysummer/status/48977005588389888)

Thom/Merlin connection? I don't see it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49602448129662976)

Look really closely at Thom's last name.
