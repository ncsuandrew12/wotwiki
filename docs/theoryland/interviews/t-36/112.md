# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #112](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#112)

You know what I'd like to see? A massive, fan-annotated WoT project, like the footnotes at
<http://bit.ly/7vrgs7>
only more extensive.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

The guys at EWOT said they were going to do this, which makes the most sense because they've done all the detail work on the individual chapters already, but it's slow going with only two people on the job. It will no doubt happen one day, but alas, not soon enough to aid Brandon on his quest.

Any chance your blog will start posting copies of your tweets and replies to questions? I loved reading those and miss them.

It will continue to do that; I haven't been tweeting a lot lately, so we haven't been posting them. There will be more.

Will there be a signing with Harriet in Utah anytime soon?

She is planning to come to Utah for the
*A Memory of Light*
tour.

Baby Meatloaf is very helpful when doing a WoT reread. He keeps bringing me various objects and toys to, you know, use in reading.
