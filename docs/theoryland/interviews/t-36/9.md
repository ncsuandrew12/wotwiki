# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#9)

The first wind is in the Mountains of Mist; I've always assumed this was a nod to Tolkien's Misty Mountains.

Look in
*The Way of Kings*
on the full map of Roshar for something similar.

Well, his Charlestonian background makes the "Two Rivers" the Charleston area, so the "Mountains of Mist" may be...

... the Smoky Mountains, upstate from his home. (FYI: the Charleston area is defined by the Ashley and Cooper Rivers.)

Nice note. I'd never known that.

Listening to WoT on audiobook, first time through series. Book one seems heavily influenced by Tolkien so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22045530888601600)

Yes, book one is very Tolkien influenced. Very. Book two less so. It's almost gone by book three.

#### Footnote

The
*Way of Kings*
map doesn't have the Misted Mountains labeled, but they border Shinovar on the east.
