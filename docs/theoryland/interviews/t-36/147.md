For those asking, Red Eagle IS working on WoT video games. Those are further along than the Mistborn one. Don't know when there will be news.

Who is working on the WoT games? I still remember playing the original PC version years ago.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/86513594962948097)

Red Eagle, who have the movie rights, are developing them. They've got several in the works.

Really? No news on the websites.

Red Eagle hasn't been forthcoming on the info; they don't want to speak too soon. They are working on them, though.

I thought Obsidian were developing the WoT games? Are they doing that alongside Red Eagle?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/86522532341096448)

Red Eagle is working with Obsidian, the latter having come on to help.
