Odd question, is it possible in the WoT universe, for there to have been a world where the Dragon was a woman?

RJ said that gender was a 'soul attribute.' Meaning, souls were reborn as the same gender.

#### Footnote

RJ addressed this in the CNN chat of 2000, again in Leiden in 2001, and at an unknown signing from around the same time (maybe a different report from the Leiden signing).
