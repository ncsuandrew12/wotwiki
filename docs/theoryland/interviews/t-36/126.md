# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #126](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#126)

I've been wondering this for a while. Will other authors ever be allowed to tackle outlier novels in the WoT world?

Also, was there ever a plan to tell more the backstory of Tam al'Thor?

Unlikely. Team Jordan feels strongly that WoT shouldn't be come an endless franchise.

There is a slim chance you will see Outriggers and/or prequels. (One of those was about Tam, by the way.)
