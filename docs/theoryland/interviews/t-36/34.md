I'm a bit ahead on my #wotrr but I am confused by Byar's actions in
*The Eye of the World*
chapter 38. He seems to "noble" for deceitful actions...

#### [RYAN LAWLER](http://twitter.com/RyanL1986/status/23146396144115713)

It also seems out of character for Byar to release suspected Darkfriends who killed Whitecloaks. Insight on his reasoning?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/23148137849823232)

Byar never was noble. What he does there is more telling of who he is than anything he says or claims.

He wants them dead. Trick them into an escape attempt, then get them executed.
