Ha! Want a twenty-year-old typo? My e-copy (RJ's original) reads: "Everything depended on whether or not the Trollops were still there."

What to say about Narg? In my mind, he's always been a hyena. I can't shake that image, though there are no hyena Trollocs.

Also, dashing my dreams of RJ typos, it turns out the original e-copies of the early WoT books were lost in a hard drive crash.

Maria says she thinks that what I'm using is a file scanned from print. Trollop/Trolloc makes more sense now.
