# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #85](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#85)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (18 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27447096831381505)

Foreshadowing some probably missed in
*The Great Hunt*
chapter seven. Prophecy of the Shadow found in the prison: "Which hand shelters? Which hand slays?"

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27452012228513792)

(For further reading on that foreshadowing I mentioned, look for a chapter titled "The One He Lost" in
*The Gathering Storm*
.)

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27453454897127424)

Ah yeah, I remember reading it now. Seemed to me to be more of a poetic connection than a real one, though.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27454404089090049)

I phrased that badly, but I don't know if I would have put it in the 'foreshadowing' category. Maybe 'retroshadowing'.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27484185748840448)

The connection there is poetic. The foreshadowing isn't of that moment, but more the concept.

#### Footnote—Terez

I think I pretty much figured it out before he responded—it makes a good deal of sense in reference to his Lews Therin dilemma and the dilemma of his harem. I tweeted about all that but Brandon responded to my first tweet, so I spared you.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27458970721460225)

Yes, there is other foreshadowing in the books that I'm not telling you about because it references
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27462078100930561)

I will hopefully catch some of those, though I'm bound to catch a few red herrings as well. :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27487935804739584)

I just passed a big one in
*The Great Hunt*
.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27488529919508481)

haha, and you know I will be scouring the pages of your vicinity looking for it. :D

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27490013226733570)

My first guess: Mat is immune to Fain's dagger. (chapter seven) Second guess: foreshadowing of Cyndane's importance in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27495120517464064)

Nope and nope. It's a very innocent line, and I won't tell you more than that. You'll spot it once you read
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27492067420676096)

Third: Slayer's role in
*A Memory of Light*
. Fourth: Perrin puts on a crown and speaks in High Chant. (the crown at least seems likely)

#### Footnote—Terez

Brandon was responding to my first two guesses, not the third and fourth (as you can see by clicking on the link for his 'nope and nope' tweet, which should show the specific tweet he responded to). He almost certainly saw guesses three and four, but he didn't comment on them.

#### [Matt Hatch](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/27607717195554816)

Readers, let's go HCFF on an "innocent" comment by @BrandonSandrson re: an
*A Memory of Light*
foreshadowing in
*The Great Hunt*
, discuss!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27855577682018304)

I've seen someone post on the innocent comment before, FYI. In fact, it was recent.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27855688260653056)

And Terez has sniffed at it before, I know.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27955033727307776)

Do you mean sniff as in turn my nose up at it? Or as in I got in the ballpark? Important distinction.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27918564216279040)

Also, I do not sniff.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/28191615692578816)

"Sniff" as in I've seen you poke at the line before, and ponder if it has meaning.

#### Footnote—Terez

I don't think that Brandon follows me around on Theoryland, and knowing that I haven't really 'sniffed' at much in these chapters, I think it's most likely he is referring to my fourth guess: the line about Perrin wearing a crown and speaking in High Chant. The update to the
[glossary entry on Saldaea](https://sites.google.com/site/hcfflibrary/glossary#saldaea)
in
*Towers of Midnight*
seems to be another hint in that direction, and of course, Min had a viewing of a Broken Crown for Perrin in way back in
*The Eye of the World*
. In order for this to be fulfilled in
*A Memory of Light*
, both Tenobia and Bashere will have to abdicate or die (as it was also confirmed in
*Towers of Midnight*
that Faile is second in the line of succession).
