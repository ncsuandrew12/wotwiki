By the way about my question re: Moridin's sexuality, my friend now thinks Moridin is in love with the Dark One... :S

I didn't catch the Moridin question first time around. Would you ask again?

He asked if Moridin was gay since he's evil but doesn't appear to be interested in taking advantage of his pets.

What she said. He seems very asexual in general. The thought came after reading the Moghedien/Shaidar Haran/Moridin scene.

It's also not just that I think he should be raping them because he's evil, it's just there is a complete lack of interest.

As for your Moridin question, it is a good one. I'll look into it as well. I haven't seen anything either way in the notes.
