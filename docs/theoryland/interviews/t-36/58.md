Odd question: In
*The Dragon Reborn*
Prologue, a Fade comes to Jaichim Carridin, it's said that the Fade smiles...

#### [DARTH ANDREA](http://twitter.com/Darth_Andrea/status/24534286258409472)

Was that Shaidar Haran? it's mentioned later he is the only Fade who smiles or laughs?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/24536568026898432)

Many think it's an early incarnation of him. I've read theories to support it.

In the RJ Q&As, he confirms that the smiling Fade is an earlier prototype of Shaidar Haran.
