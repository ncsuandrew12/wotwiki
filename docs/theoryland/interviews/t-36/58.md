Odd question: In
*The Dragon Reborn*
Prologue, a Fade comes to Jaichim Carridin, it's said that the Fade smiles...

Was that Shaidar Haran? it's mentioned later he is the only Fade who smiles or laughs?

Many think it's an early incarnation of him. I've read theories to support it.

In the RJ Q&As, he confirms that the smiling Fade is an earlier prototype of Shaidar Haran.
