# [Interview #36, Entry #130]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#130)

In my mind, the redstone doorway in Tear looks like Delicate Arch. This is not rational, and not how it looks, but I can't help it.

Delicate Arch, by the way, is a specific redstone arch in Moab, Utah. I'd post a picture, but my wifi wizardry doesn't allow Google.

The wonderful @17thshard grabbed a delicate arch pic for you all:

Wifi on my flight is not free, but Twitter works, for some reason. WHAT WIZARDRY IS THIS.

So, the airline wifi provider has a "Free Twitter" thing going on. Nothing supernatural. Too bad. I was already building a magic system...

Beginning of Chapter 36 in Book Four. The Waste is described a lot like Moab, Utah.
