You know, Nynaeve, it would have been 'wrong' and all, but I'd totally have forgiven you if you'd just offed Moghedien in the palace.

What about Traveling?
*Cuendillar*
? And all the rest?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56452258400972800)

I'm not following you. What are you asking about?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56452512626126848)

Oh, you mean "If Moghedien died, we wouldn't have these things." True, true.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56452669392420865)

But at the same time...they keep just letting the Forsaken get away. Ah, well.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56456416776560640)

Now I'm imagining Nynaeve towing Moghedien out with her and bringing her to the White Tower for justice—only to find Elaida in charge...

#### [HERIDFAN](http://twitter.com/heridfan/status/56458927692447744)

How did Moghedien know about sad bracelets [Domination Band]? Semirhage said in
*The Gathering Storm*
that they were made after the Forsaken were imprisoned.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56468022096965632)

I believe Moghedien said she'd been doing some research about the Breaking and had learned about them.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/56468891722977280)

There's been some debate about Moghedien's strength in the Power since she and Nynaeve were equal in
*The Shadow Rising*
, but...

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/56469120312549376)

...Nynaeve hadn't reached full strength as late as
*The Path of Daggers*
. Is Moghedien the weakest of the Forsaken?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56470831991234561)

Honestly? I'd have to look it up. I don't know off-hand how Cyndane fits into things now. Still powerful, but not as powerful.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/56566958929362944)

Cyndane is still the strongest female; that was made clear in Graendal's POV in
*The Path of Daggers*
. Just weaker than Lanfear.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR (9 APRIL)](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/56682675691470848)

Yeah, I was mostly just curious about the considerable gap between Moghedien and the strongest female Forsaken.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/56683313049509888)

There was a lot of debate on
[RAFO.com](readandfindout.com)
on whether Elayne and Egwene are close to Moghedien since she's so weak.
