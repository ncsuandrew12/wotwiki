Any thoughts on my "Mat is Gaidal Cain" theory? His time with the snakes/foxes makes me wonder.

Do you REALLY want me to weigh in on this?

#### [JUSTIN LEE](http://twitter.com/evanchooly/status/27489208142663680)

Absolutely! Though I'm likely to get a RAFO ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27494955777789952)

Well, as I remember, RJ said that Olver was too old to be Gaidal Cain. If Olver's to old, then Mat...

#### [JUSTIN LEE](http://twitter.com/evanchooly/status/27495269620785152)

He's certainly going to be late to the Big Show if he was naturally born after Olver.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27496572598095872)

Gaidal has been reborn, and I do know who he is, and he is younger than Olver. (Sorry.)

#### [BRIAN CAYEN](http://twitter.com/BRCayen/status/27783824045768704)

Not sure if this was asked but have we seen Gaidal Cain reincarnated "on screen"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27873706810277888)

RAFO on Cain, I'm afraid.
