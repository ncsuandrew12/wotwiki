# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#40)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23125319615516672)

At the 35% mark we have Mat speaking the Old Tongue for the first time, books ahead of him getting memories stuck in his head.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23125732251144192)

I've always found this a very curious event. Of the five Two Riversers, Mat's powers are the most subtly foreshadowed in the book.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23125918209802240)

Unless you count the short exchange between Lan and Perrin about wolves in a much earlier chapter.

#### [KRIT PETTY](http://twitter.com/bgrishinko/status/23126322096115712)

I thought that Mat's Old Tongue was a small way of RJ letting you think maybe Mat was the important one, not Rand.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23138563205894144)

Yes, I think you're right on that count. It was certainly meant to make us think.

#### [LEE DAVIS](http://twitter.com/#%21/dilsnik/status/23132128594100224)

The speaking the Old Tongue is from his bloodline though, not his memories in that case, isn't it?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23140679576195072)

Yes, but it's still foreshadowing. He's the one who does it, not the others.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/23189050303184896)

In
*The Eye of the World*
, is Mat remembering the Old Tongue from his own past life or from his ancestors?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23194235897380864)

Good question. He seems to have confirmed Old Blood for the Old Tongue, but the Aemon memory?

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/#%21/FelixPax/status/23195153225224192)

That's what my belief is, Aemon. Mat Cauthon is the reborn soul of Aemon. Aemon's Old Tongue.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23468364743581696)

It isn't made clear. It could be either. The implication is his bloodline.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23468616015945728)

The Aemon connection is certainly implied strongly.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (7 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23490703707348992)

"A metal tower?" Rand said. "I'll bet there's treasure inside," Mat said. "A thing like that must have been made to protect something..."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23492404753465344)

This is the start of Mat acting tainted, which always makes me sad. It will be a while before I can read him as himself again.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23499513977118721)

First time one of the boys thinks, "I wish [insert other boy] were here. He knows what to say to women" happens at the 48% mark.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (10 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24545486148993025)

I love that in the scene in Four Kings, the fact that the innkeeper is thin seems almost as ill an omen as a flock of ravens.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24567192607526913)

I wonder if Mat wearing the scarf around his head here is foreshadowing intentionally, or by coincidence, of the scarf on his neck.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24567407959867392)

Either way, there's some other strong foreshadowing there of events in
*Towers of Midnight*
, though I won't say specifics to avoid spoilers.

#### [ADAM DOWARD](http://twitter.com/AdamDoward/status/24570887202148352)

I've been wondering for ages is Mat going to wear an eye patch? Or will he wear a strip of cloth like Gemmel's Grymauch?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/24576268116697088)

RAFO.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24573654062866432)

Not sure what I think of the "start chapter, flashback to what has happened since last chapter" narrative style RJ prefers here.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24574411180875776)

I don't think he does it as much later. In these first books, he seems more worried about characters going chronologically off of each other.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24576068241326080)

Note that I do like flashbacks, and think that Chapter 33 is interesting structurally. I don't know if it fits just right, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com//BrandonSandrson/status/24581104686071808)

A good point: Some note that the erratic timeline here does help reinforce the sense of sickness from Rand and Mat's growing paranoia.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24587728033153025)

Also, it's fun that Mat is getting paranoid and crazy because of the dagger—except when he's thinking about food or a nice bed.
