Amusingly, as a young man, I was annoyed at Nynaeve and Moiraine. But I didn't bat an eye when the boys ran off alone in Shadar Logoth.

How old were you when you first started reading WoT books?

14 or 15. It was right around my birthday, so I don't know if it was before or after.

Speaking of Shadar Logoth, Harriet tells a story involving it. Tor wanted to print small teasers of
*The Eye of the World*
to distribute and hook folks.

Harriet, the editor, insisted that the booklets go all the way to Shadar Logoth. She thought that would be sure to draw people in.
