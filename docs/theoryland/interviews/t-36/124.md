Timeline wise, was Aviendha's meeting with Nakomi in the waste before or after Verin had met with Egwene and died?

Ha. It seems everyone wants to know if this is possibly Verin. There will be timestamps in
*A Memory of Light*
to let you guess.

There are enough existing timestamps to show that Verin can't be Nakomi. But I don't believe timestamps in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49640410825506817)

So far as I know, there are no timestamp errors in
*Towers of Midnight*
. I have a solid timeline from people better at such things than I.

There COULD still be mistakes, but I think the book is more accurate than people assume because of the
[Tam issue](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#101)
.

#### [HERIDFAN](http://twitter.com/heridfan/status/49642651733078017)

I don't mean Tam issue. There are for example clouds breaking in Caemlyn in Chapter 8, way before Rand's epiphany on Dragonmount.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49650763273732096)

That's a good note. I'll fire that one off to Team Jordan and see if we made an error. Got any others?
