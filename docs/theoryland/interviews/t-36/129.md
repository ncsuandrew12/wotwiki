Looks like Vin trounced her next opponent in the Suvudu cage match. Sorry to not do a write up; swamped over here. (more)

However, she fights Zedd (from the Sword of Truth.) For this...I will give you something. Hopefully, it will be fun.

As for Perrin vs. Paul Atreides...whew. That's a tough match up. I pick Perrin for solidarity, but Paul is a tough enemy. Very tough.

Epic back-and-forth battle between Paul and Perrin going on over at Suvudu. I support Perrin, but agree that Paul is probably more powerful.

Vin is up against Zedd in the Suvudu Cage Match. Here's how I think the fight would go down.

Vin faces Quick Ben in the Suvudu Cage Match final. Perrin meets Jon Snow in the consolation match.
