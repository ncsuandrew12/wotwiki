# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #70](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#70)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (11 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24913758929289216)

I'm now onto the last part of
*The Eye of the World*
. I've mentioned before that I, personally, find this the roughest part of the entire series.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/24924117799014401)

Worse than books between
*Lord of Chaos*
and
*Winter's Heart*
? Really?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24924991271211008)

Yes, honestly. I've mentioned before I don't have the problem with those that others do.

#### [DOVI JOEL](http://twitter.com/dovijoel/status/24918705347502081)

Do you mean roughest as in not well written? I love that part, I find it so epic (especially when the Creator talks to him). [Note: this is Dovi Joel's assumption.]

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24920626179350528)

None of it is poorly written. In fact, some of the scenes—such as the Ways—are wonderful.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24920715417358336)

It's just that it seems like we have a different book, with different goals, starting on us here.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24914619055210496)

The climax for
*The Eye of the World*
doesn't completely click for me. I like the Ways, I like the Blight, but the entire package feels too sudden.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24915279494520832)

We spend the entire book with Tar Valon as our goal and Ba'alzamon as villain. Now, the Eye is the goal and two Forsaken are villains.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24915942869835776)

Personally, I think this is due to RJ planning books 1-3 as one novel, then discovering it was too much and creating a break-point.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24918014864400384)

To be fair, I feel I had some of the same problems at the end of Mistborn. Powers manifest that I could have foreshadowed better.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24918394776068096)

One of the great challenges as a writer, particularly in fantasy, is to learn that balance of foreshadowing vs. pacing.

#### [BONZI](http://twitter.com/Bonzi777/status/24919081626902528)

And I would think, foreshadowing effectively vs. giving away too much.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24920770970918912)

Yes, exactly.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (11 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24923041943261184)

For those curious, I'm reasonably sure books 1-3 were one novel at first. Tom Doherty, CEO of Tor, told me in detail of RJ's WoT pitch.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24923369065422848)

He pitched a trilogy, but the first book ended with Rand taking the sword (that wasn't a sword) from the Stone (that wasn't a stone.)

#### [MICHAEL REYNOLDS](http://twitter.com/gmreynoldsjr/status/24923936022073344)

The sword in the stone!!! How on Earth did I miss that? :shame:

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24924505428201474)

Lol. I missed it the first time too. And things like Caemlyn, Egwene, Gawyn, Galad, Merrilin. I at least got Artur Hawkwing...

#### [MICHAEL REYNOLDS](http://twitter.com/gmreynoldsjr/status/24925063488737280)

Ever feel like RJ removed any possibility of borrowing from any mythology ever again? He seemingly hit 'em all buffet-style.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24931414864560128)

Actually, I've felt that very thing.

#### [JAMES POWELL](http://twitter.com/feelieking/status/24924571215859712)

I'd heard that one reason that WOT is so long is that Tor asked RJ for "more books", and he thought they meant "more WOT".

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24928650700783616)

That's not actually true, from what I know. Tor never pushed RJ for more books. He was allowed to what he wanted, as he wanted.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24929695665496066)

People are noting George R.R. Martin expanded
*A Song of Ice and Fire*
also. RJ and GRRM are similar types of writers:
<http://bit.ly/e59ox0>
Search for 'gardener.'

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24932296729567232)

I'm am more of an architect than a gardener. I do more 'gardening' on character, but I plan world and plot very extensively.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/24931313173667840)

Did RJ have a cluster of concepts, themes or concepts written down in his notes? Mindmaps? To create his story's "garden"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24946503105650688)

Yes, many.

#### [FELIX PAX (17 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/27068536249647104)

What do you think of the literary method of foreshadowing by saying something is impossible to do or will not occur?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27084147101011968)

I think it can work very well. RJ certainly did it quite a bit. You need to be somewhat subtle with it, though.
