If the Shadow's male channelers are called Dreadlords, what are the female channelers called in the Blight?

Right now, most are called Black Ajah. But I see what you're getting at. I've always thought of Dreadlords as gender neutral.

I'll have to ask on that one. I honestly don't have the answer handy.
