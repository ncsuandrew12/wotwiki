# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #116](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#116)

From questions I've gotten at signings, people still seem confused by the black threads/cords sometimes attached to Forsaken.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46663094767853568)

I thought this clear; that these were the means by which male Forsaken avoided the taint. Is there still uncertainty on this point?

RJ said in interview that they were protection from the taint but he also
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=183#14)
at one point that...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/46793449965486080)

...they were the conduits by which the True Power could be accessed (if they had permission). [He also
[contradicted himself](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#11)
on that, apparently.]

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/46682260698705920)

There may be a tad more to the cords that RJ didn't state, but I will say that one major reason is the taint protection.
