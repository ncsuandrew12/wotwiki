I seem to be one of the few who think that Taim is a transmigrated Asmodean; will we find out about Taim finally in
*A Memory of Light*
?

Some things, at least, you will discover.

#### Footnote

RJ confirmed
[in NYC](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=43#5)
that the Dark One wanted to transmigrate Asmodean, but could not because of how and where he died.
