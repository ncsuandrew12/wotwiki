I know this is a long shot but can we expect any cover art drafts for
*A Memory of Light*
soon?

Got a question from @SaintChristobel about
*A Memory of Light*
cover art. It's in the works. I'm told it will be ready for reveal at the end of the year.

Mr. Sweet is working on it, and I've seen early drafts. They look good.

What kind of good? Good compared to the other WoT covers or good compared to for example the ebook Mat cover?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/107166666990956544)

Good for a Sweet WoT cover. I like the design, and it plays to his strengths.
