If all of the Forsaken were sealed in the Bore, and the Madness came after that, how can the prologue of
*The Eye of the World*
happen?

I mean, Ishamael is walking around and talking and channeling, shouldn't he not be able to do so?

...unless the whole thing is a vision of Lews Therin's madness?

That was really Ishamael, not madness. He wasn't sealed in as strongly as the others, remember.
