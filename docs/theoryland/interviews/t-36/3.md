# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#3)

Man, I love the prologue of
*The Eye of the World*
. Some of my favorite writing in the entire series. Great insight into Ishamael's personality pre-madness.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22029268426956800)

People like to talk of Rand's character development. Elan -> Ishamael -> Moridin is almost as interesting to me. His outlook has evolved so much.

#### [JUSTIN LEE](http://twitter.comevanchooly/status/22036469870759936)

Has it really evolved? he's still the megalomanical favorite/topdog he's always seen himself to be.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22040987345883136)

No, he's really changed a lot. He's a fatalist now, as I mentioned to @dragonmount. He knows far more.

#### [JASON DENZEL](http://twitter.com/dragonmount/status/22037696142639104)

How would you compare Ishamael's motivations from when he was Elan vs when he was Moridin?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22040423891476480)

Elan is actually more selfish. He still thinks he will rule, that the Dark One will take over the world and create a new one.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22040602807894017)

Moridin has been through madness and touched the mind of the Dark One. He is far more fatalistic, and actually less selfish.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22128869569994753)

And therefore...less predictable? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22141314476810240)

I was wondering if anyone would pick up on that quote in relation to my tweet.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

In
[TGS 39](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/tgs/ch13.html)
, Verin tells Egwene that the Dark One looks for selfishness more than any other trait in his leaders—namely, the Chosen—because it makes them predictable.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/22087662022168576)

Is it wrong for me to have been under the impression that Moridin isn't "mad?" I've thought he was less mad than he was...

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/22087771598360577)

...as Ishamael. Mad being crazy not mad being evil because obviously he's evil.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22126974826717184)

Moridin is less insane than Ishamael was. Much as Rand is less insane than Lews Therin was.

#### [AZRAL HANAN](http://twitter.com/Azral_Joe/status/22233473087442944)

You say Moridin is less selfish. Is he now a Dark Buddha wanting to end the suffering of existence in the nirvana of oblivion?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22396403380654081)

It's not that he's unselfish. But compare his lines in
*The Eye of the World*
and
*Knife of Dreams*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
to see the difference.
