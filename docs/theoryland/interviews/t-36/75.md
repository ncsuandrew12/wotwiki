Some friends and I are making a tournament bracket for monsters (194 total). We have three Darkhounds vs a Myrddraal. Thoughts?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27215574018826240)

New or old Darkhounds?

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/27232147504898050)

Huh? Is there a meaningful difference between new or old Darkhounds?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27427655582228480)

So readers should expect new nasty winks from the Shadow, aye? It's as if Osan'gar is alive again making creatures.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/27778910359916545)

At least during the Age of Legends, Aginor (later named Osan'gar) did create new devilish creatures.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27873590510620673)

Yes, and they no longer have Aginor. But I wouldn't say that means there won't be anything new.

#### Footnote

Brandon is probably hinting with that last that Aginor had nothing to do with the new breed of Darkhounds. The new ones can do the Terminator II thing and reform after being chopped to pieces, and the prevailing theory suggests that this is because Slayer has been creating them in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, so they have some inherent properties of the Dream World. They probably cannot be killed by anything short of balefire. The old Darkhounds are nearly as tough—Moiraine used balefire to kill the ones that chased them in
*The Dragon Reborn*
—but Perrin managed to kill one after shooting it a few times.
