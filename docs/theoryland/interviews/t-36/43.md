I noticed in
*Towers of Midnight*
that the viewpoint momentarily switched to a man's (maybe Rand) amidst one of Min's POVs.

I think we fixed that one for the paperback. Basically a problem with stitching two scenes together.

#### Footnote

It was actually a mix-up between Faile's and Perrin's POVs.
