Ha. Thom showing up at night, and people grumbling, makes me smile now knowing about the unwritten prequel involving his arrival.

Weren't there two other planned prequels that never made it? Will they ever see the light of day?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22053046510952449)

Yes. But they probably won't be published, I'm afraid.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22060696095162368)

For those asking, I'm not allowed to talk about the prequels yet. It's unlikely they'll be written. If they aren't, I'll see what I can say.
