I am going to have to pester @BrandonSandrson on my loony theory of Shaidar Haran being Asmodean 2.0. Who's with me? I have a decent case!

Lol. Wow, I've never heard that one before.

#### [BRIAN MAVITY](http://twitter.com/bmavity/status/22789862088245250)

Your "lol" saddens me. You know, there's enough evidence that you could get away with adding it to the last book!

Only problem is RJ said that Asmodean's soul was outside the Dark One's reach, though he wasn't specific as to why. (As I remember.)
