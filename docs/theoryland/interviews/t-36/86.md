# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #86](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#86)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (18 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27466158403747841)

Unless I'm missing one, our first Egwene viewpoint in the series is the way into
*The Great Hunt*
. She is our fifth viewpoint character.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27489517506138112)

Point to @RajivMote: I DID miss an Egwene viewpoint. In "Ravens," the new first chapter of
*The Eye of the World*
in the Young Adult repackage of the WoT books.

#### [ERIN KELLY](http://twitter.com/LiterateKnits/status/27476136313229312)

Sixth, if you count Bors and the five seconds of Moraine at the end of
*The Great Hunt*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27490131057311744)

I already counted Moraine. Not Bors, though. I'm talking Viewpoint characters, which means characters who commonly have VPs.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27494630073311232)

Fortune prick me, a Domon viewpoint. Don't know if I'll count him as the sixth VP character, though. We don't return to him frequently.

#### [HADNAN KADERE](http://twitter.com/KadereHadnan/status/27515705742073856)

But you counted Moiraine who only shows up once in
*The Eye of the World*
, once in
*The Shadow Rising*
, and twice in
*The Fires of Heaven*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27845519166406656)

She's got a ton of VP time here at the beginning of
*The Great Hunt*
.

#### [HADNAN KADERE](http://twitter.com/KadereHadnan/status/27847096417648641)

She has exactly five VPs in
*The Great Hunt*
. She has exactly nine in the whole series (not counting
*New Spring*
). That's only three more than Fain.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27502405532782593)

I've been asked who was behind the plot to see Domon dead in
*The Great Hunt*
. It was Hamlet, obviously.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (19 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27854847906684928)

I'll count Fain as our sixth viewpoint character (or, maybe he's fifth and Egwene is sixth.) I love the scene where they find the dead Fade.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27929204620271616)

Your Inquisitors in Mistborn always made me think of that Fade. Sorry if I've said that before; I can't remember, lol.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28191934858141696)

Yes I think there's got to be some kind of unconscious thing going on there on my part. (Re: Fades and Inquisitors.)

#### Footnote

[Bors/Carridin](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/c/carridin.html)
had
[four POVs](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=368)
, while Thom only had four before
*A Memory of Light*
, and Domon also had four, but all four were in
*The Great Hunt*
.
