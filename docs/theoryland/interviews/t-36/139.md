# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #139](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#139)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58562210129133568)

Salt Lake Airport has been Brandalized. Three hardcovers of
*Towers of Midnight*
signed and one
*The Gathering Storm*
paperback. On my way to Jordancon!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58568179449995264)

Wheel of Time drinking game! Each time one of the Wondergirls wanders off alone or in a pair and gets kidnapped, take a shot.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58568976103514112)

If you do, you'll take a shot every two or three books. So, uh, every few weeks. Okay, it's a bad drinking game. What'd you expect? I'm Mormon. :)

#### [BRENT WEEKS](http://twitter.com/brentweeks/status/58578902234308609)

Awesome dual tweet there. Well done, sir.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58591476736724992)

:)

#### [JOSEPH DYE](http://twitter.com/josephWDye/status/58575420177657856)

Just wondering, do you have any magic underwear?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58590051050864640)

You do realize that what you just asked is somewhat akin to walking up to a Muslim and calling him a towelhead, don't you?

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58611184689102848)

Being a fan of your work doesn't mean that someone shouldn't call out nonsense when they see or hear it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58612524395929600)

I'm not sure what you're replying to, exactly.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58614207515594752)

Sorry, I was responding to your reply to @JosephWDye where you compared his question to calling a Muslim a towelhead.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58614573267296256)

I like your work, and I think that you are the best choice to finish WoT, but I was disappointed to find out you are LDS.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58615037476077569)

Where calling a Muslim a towelhead is more of a racist/cultural insult, what @JosephWDye said addresses a nonsense belief.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58616068264038400)

Asking, or challenging someone about their beliefs is a good thing to do. Ridiculing them is not.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58616613393547264)

I disagree. Some beliefs are so ridiculous that ridicule is the only appropriate response. And it's often effective.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58616509425139713)

Wearing a symbol of my faith is no more a nonsense belief than a Muslim wearing head gear or a Catholic wearing a cross.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58616628883095552)

The simile is exactly the same.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58617133042638848)

Again, I disagree. A keffiyeh or cross isn't understood to be magical in the way that the Mormon undergarments are.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58617528397729792)

There is nothing magical about them. They are a symbol of faith. Faith may be a protection, true.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58617703501545473)

Some may regard the
[garments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_garment)
as having innate protection, but some also believe a cross or Bible does.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58617572135944192)

Catholics believing that crackers and wine actually turn into flesh and blood would be similar, and also worthy of ridicule.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58618286170058753)

Ridicule is an inferior way of dealing with these issues, as it will polarize and demean. Logic and common ground serve better.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58618583437160448)

I used to think that as well, but people of 'faith' don't hold their beliefs because of logic and evidence, and so...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58618733895225345)

...it is next to impossible to demonstrate to them via those avenues that what they believe is false...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58618986052599808)

Many do not [hold their beliefs because of logic and evidence]. There are some who do, however. And I think faith should be founded in experience and evidence.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619224821731328)

Then it wouldn't be faith, it would just be belief. Faith is belief in a proposition in the absence of evidence...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619283588120576)

...or in the face of contradictory evidence.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58619832303763457)

Well, your definition of faith is certainly one. However, I see it more as trusting in something that has been proven to you.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58620087325831169)

If my father says, "I will come through for you on such and such" and I trust him because he's proven [himself] in the past, that is faith.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58620592034811904)

You're conflating the term 'faith' here. I'm sure you don't have to be told that a word can have more than one meaning.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58620699903926272)

The meaning here equates to 'a reasonable expectation based on experience' That's not the same as religious faith.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58621397341175808)

I am aware of the different definitions. I was trying to define my definition, not say a blanket definition.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58621508033064960)

My definition of religious faith, for myself, is exactly what you said. An expectation based on experience.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58621697728856064)

As a member of the LDS faith, who has had ample proof given to me of God's existence—the only logical way I could believe...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58621884341825536)

I find it important to search for the real truths and to understand people who disagree with me, to see if I am wrong.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58618409008644097)

I will not go so far as to say that there is never reason for ridicule, however, as I was able to think of a few exceptions.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58618911133937665)

Ridicule can be effective in demonstrating just how absurd the belief system is from outside...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619071536705537)

...just as all other religions are to the believer. As Heinlein said, "One man's religion is another man's belly laugh."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58619347098279936)

Proper ridicule could be appropriate, couched in a form of "Look, can you see how silly this sounds to the outsider?"

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58619497254371328)

However, walking up to someone and saying "You are an idiot, and this is stupid" is hardly a good way to begin a dialogue.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619562488369152)

Well, I just don't think that I owe much politeness to people who don't care in the least for logic and evidence, and are...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619698308329472)

...doing their level best to retard science education, repeal social advancements, and who look forward to the destruction...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619763588476929)

...of the majority of mankind with anticipation.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58619992853331968)

It's really amazing to me, having read your tweets for a while now that someone belonging to a group that was officially...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58620348186365952)

...racist until you were a child, and which has done all it can to prevent homosexual marriage by backing prop 8 is so openly..

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58620480705400832)

...averse to those kinds of bigotry. And YET, you continue to identify yourself as LDS.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58620587773399040)

The greatest changes to good people are made through empathy and an attempt to understand.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58622008660983808)

Also, if I vanish, it's because I am landing and lose internet—not because I'm ignoring you. We could lose it at any moment.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58622323896483841)

No worries, I'm about to be off for a while as well. Again, I think your writing is great, and you seem like a great guy...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58622464061747200)

I just wish we could all outgrow this nonsense, and get on with the work of making the world a better place. Cheers, Jason

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58620765737721856)

We must continue to be polite and strive for common ground. The biggest problem with our discourse these days is...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58621253191335936)

...the justification where people on any side say "I no longer need to be a civil human being to these people because of X."

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58621436671180800)

Come on Brandon. I think that the biggest problem with discourse today is that faith gets a free pass. If someone tells you...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58621561627873282)

...that he believes something on faith, then he thinks that that is unassailable, and I don't agree.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58621698802581504)

I don't think that I am under any obligation to treat the enemies of culture with any politeness or respect...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58621837806018560)

These are the people who want to ruin science education, retard research into lifesaving treatments that could alleviate...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58621975832178688)

...the suffering of literally millions of men, women, and children, prevent homosexuals and other minorities from exercising...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58622154022993920)

...their basic rights, and in all other ways trying to roll back human progress to the bronze age. I will not stand idly by.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58622477684842496)

If you let your disagreements turn you into hatred and incivility, you become that which you hate, my friend.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58622709277540353)

(Sorry to go Yoda on you. That last bit was on the heavy-handed side.)

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58622851535740928)

I think we're both better than sound-byte platitudes. What I hate is people who enshrine bigotry and ignorance behind...

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58623014400573440)

...a shield of 'faith,' while working to destroy everything that the enlightenment has gifted us with.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58622801103425536)

Some of the people you speak of are worthy of your contempt. Most are just...well, people.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58622931047170049)

The answer to your problems is teaching them to see the other. You cannot do that unless you can do it yourself...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58623103332392960)

Faith deserves to be challenged more than it does, and we should not be able to stand behind it as an iron wall.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58623200392781824)

I just simply believe that we all need to see one another more as human beings.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58623254386053120)

Anyhow, good talking to you, even if it is a real pain to do so in these tiny Twitter chunks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58623597371068417)

Nice chatting with you too. Again, sorry for the Yoda. You have good arguments. But I think you're giving in to a simplistic...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58623758549786624)

...view of "Us against them" where "Them" are always trying to destroy everything that is good or virtuous.

#### [JASON STEELE](http://twitter.com/jasonmsteele/status/58623401408995329)

Oh, and welcome to Atlanta (where I happen to live).

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58623925738942464)

Thanks! And thank you for reading. I'll do my best to enjoy Atlanta.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/58624017535475713)

Okay, we're landing. Signing off from Twitter, folks, and see you at JordanCon! I have Magic cards. :)
