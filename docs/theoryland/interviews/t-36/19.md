# [Interview #36, Entry #19]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#19)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (4 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22399171948453888)

Yes, early WoT is very Tolkien influenced. But several original things really stood out to me when I was younger.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22399656168263680)

1) The magic. 2) Strong female protagonists. 3) A woman 'wizard' figure who was far more human than others I'd seen. 4) Tam lives.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22400417505742848)

Though I like Gandalf, Dumbledore, Belgarath, & Allanon, I prefer Moiraine as a character. (Actually, Allanon always just annoyed me.)

#### [HARRISON ISRAEL](http://twitter.com/liveforthecity2/status/22413706885337088)

I always liked Allanon :(

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22432876633006080)

It's okay. I'm fond of him. But he still annoyed me.

#### [HAMLETISDEAD](http://twitter.com/HamletIsDead/status/22430009251598336)

Can you share what it is about Allanon that annoyed you? I can list a few, but the main reason was his decision making...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22442183307034624)

Mostly the air of mystery and withholding information. Often a problem with people in his role, but he seemed more-so.

#### [BRYCE NIELSEN](http://twitter.com/shnar/status/22405803512172544)

What about Polgara? :P

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22426430465908736)

Polgara was awesome. Belgarath was pretty cool too, but Moiraine always feels slightly more real than either one to me.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22426560942309377)

But that's modern Brandon. Teenage Brandon might have thought differently.

#### [CHRIS WOOD](http://twitter.com/taloncarde/status/22405993161822208)

But which of those early wizards was your favorite? I liked Belgarath, but Eddings was one of my first series.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22426821295341569)

As a youth, I often listed Eddings as my favorite author. It wasn't until I was older that WoT took over completely.

#### [CHRIS WOOD](http://twitter.com/taloncarde/status/22427767928786944)

I agree, I still read Eddings and suggest him to people who are "new" into fantasy, but it has gone down my list too.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22436852564758528)

There is a perfect age to read Eddings, where he resonates best. As you age, something about his characters and plots...stiffens.

#### [JENN HOGAN](http://twitter.comfibropal/status/22528242720178176)

I am in agreement but I love Belgarath's humor and his devotion to family and his God and his brothers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22529963408236544)

Belgarath was interesting also in being an amalgamation of a trickster figure and a wise mentor. By far one of Eddings' most round.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22530201128800256)

Both him and Polgara. They're both also more powerful than Moiraine. But there's just something about her. True wisdom.

#### [JOHN STOCKTON](http://twitter.com/johnnystock/status/22399999501402112)

I was thrown by your "when I was younger" remark until I remembered this series started 20 years ago. Wow.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22402665560408064)

I started when I was 14 or 15...

#### [YELLOW](http://twitter.com/monkeysandles/status/22380573649534976)

The WoT names always annoyed me because they're so close to real names. Any chance of dropping a Blixbop into
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22401289086312448)

Mr. Jordan did this intentionally, to hint that the WoT world was our world in the future (and the past.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22401405872513024)

It's part of the 'feel' of the world. They are close to real names because they ARE real names, just many years removed.

#### [TADBO](http://twitter.com/tadbo/status/22400424703168513)

The females in The Wheel of Time are among the most two-dimensional in the history of fantasy.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22402870649294849)

I disagree. Case in point: Tolkien's female protagonists. (Which was the comparison I was making.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22403052635951104)

But even beyond that, you have to remember, this is a society with some skewed gender relationships because of the way magic works.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22403216335441921)

But Moiraine is hardly two-dimensional. Neither is Nynaeve. They can be annoying, yes, but that's not the same as two-dimensional.

#### [TADBO](http://twitter.com/tadbo/status/22400794783391744)

They scheme, they argue, they tug on their skirts and stamp their feet, or they fall at Rand's feet. Really?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22405398677954560)

Aviendha is very distinctive. Tuon is very distinctive. Min is very distinctive. Many of the Aes Sedai act as you say, but...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22405505834029056)

...I see this as an intentional effect of the society they live in.

#### [ZEERAK WASEEM](http://twitter.com/zeerakw/status/22401455298183169)

Don't you get annoyed with the females in WoT? The female lead I prefer is Aviendha, the rest are full of themselves.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22405786214862849)

Oh, I didn't say they didn't annoy me at times. I said they were strong, and I'll add that they are interesting.

#### [TADBO](http://twitter.com/tadbo/status/22409054005493760)

Final note. I would argue that Jordan's female protagonists are MAIN characters, whereas Tolkien's are mainly supporting.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22432127438028802)

The Tolkien point is valid. However, remember what started this conversation. I was saying things about the WoT that impressed me.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22432207897366528)

One was a large cast of female main characters, something a lot of fantasy by men I'd read was lacking.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22416715371515904)

WoT females are caricaturish, sometimes stereotypical, but not two-dimensional. (This from a female.)

#### [TADBO](http://twitter.com/tadbo/status/22417821027794945)

Yes, caricatures. A better description than two-dimensional.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22425807443988480)

Well, different people read things differently. If WoT's women didn't work for you, I understand why, though I don't feel the same.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22425919993946112)

You're not the only one to feel that way.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22426635047272448)

The fact that I see them as caricatures helps me to enjoy them as characters more. It's RJ's own type of dry humor.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22434274552582144)

I view them more of products of a society where social norms are different, and women have something 'machismo'-like.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22434444002463744)

It makes them act similar in places, even though when you see into their souls, there is something deeper.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22436957187477504)

In my opinion this is also true, but the caricature part is an important aspect of accepting ALL WoT characters as they are.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22437421492731904)

They, like the story itself, are ubertropes. There is more to them than that, just as there is more to the story.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/FelixPax/status/22437250268659712)

It's as if RJ's sense of humor was written for a theater company on stage. Bombastic, perhaps?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22724468094795777)

I think the word you are looking for is 'exaggerated'. But yes, stage-acting a very good comparison.

#### [TADBO](http://twitter.com/tadbo/status/22427732692434945)

I don't know if I ever saw it as 'dry humor'. The Aes Sedai scared the crap out of me in high school.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22428152634540032)

Well, maybe now that you're a big boy... ;)
[RJ said](https://docs.google.com/View?docID=dcjspjqg_90hcpvqvdb&revision=_latest#leopards)
he'd rather hunt leopards...

#### [TADBO](http://twitter.com/tadbo/status/22428558697701376)

True enough. XD

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22438244872355840)

I mean, have you SEEN the
[map of Tar Valon](http://www.nucleus.com/%7Edalen/maps/tarvalonmap.gif)
? It's supposed to be funny, people. And serious at the same time, of course.

#### [JAMES FURLONG](http://twitter.com/Lacobus/status/22443851507572736)

Haha! Just clicked on, never noticed THAT before. Hoho!

#### [HBFFERREIRA](http://twitter.com/HBFFerreira/status/22446503041699841)

LOL Never noticed it before either.

#### [KAREN BASKINS](http://twitter.com/KarenBaskins/status/22462743688777728)

LOL! In nearly twenty years of reading WoT, I never took notice of the Tar Valon map. Thank you for the laugh. I needed that. :-)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22442519212072960)

I've wondered about the map for Tar Valon. That...well, that can't be an accident. I've never asked Team Jordan, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22445715808583680)

Needless to say, it wasn't something I noticed when I was a teen.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22448502361563136)

Someone asked RJ about it. Sort of. His
[answer](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=234#5)
was hilarious.

#### [RICHARD FIFE](http://twitter.com/RichardFife/status/22458042155016192)

Ya know, for some odd reason, I never really
*saw*
the map of Tar Valon. Now I'll never unsee it...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22459197467656193)

Indeed, it cannot be unseen. :)

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22489826683002880)

...wow, this really changes how I view the siege, harbor, and the iron chain becoming
*cuendillar*
.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22492024703819776)

You are such a perv, boss.

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22492838411378688)

Showed my wife the map. Her immediate reaction: "Oh, Jim Rigney." Big smile.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22496554912841728)

You'd never seen that before?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22499903963930624)

He had. Was just inspired by the moment to show it to his wife. And he'd never seen the quote. :)

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22507165226897408)

I'd seen it...it was a while back; I remember thinking "really???" This reminded me and the quote made it hilarious.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22508675121815552)

Could give a whole new meaning to 'Rand had daydreamed over Master al'Vere's old map...'

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22508829027598336)

'...half the boys in Emond's Field had daydreamed over it.'

#### [NICHOLAS BROWN](http://twitter.com/goldeneyez07/status/22554785915871232)

To the blind... what am I seeing? I see a fish or a submarine. Is there something else?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22724412625129472)

Hm. How to do this without going places I don't care to go... Maybe a link will suffice.
