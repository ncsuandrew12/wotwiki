Do you struggle to write Cadsuane from an unbiased perspective, since she's not a favorite of yours?

I thought I would, but she has such a strong personality, she's actually easy.

The ease of writing a character has more to do with how proactive they are and how easy it is to get into their head.

I've learned a lot about her, and about writing, from the series.
