# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #122](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#122)

Here's a question: Why does Elayne (and RJ in an interview) say that Galad fancied Nynaeve when he clearly fancied Egwene?

#### [LIRA LEIRNER](http://twitter.com/LiraLeirner/status/48904021511110656)

Especially considering that RJ said "at the beginning"... I could imagine Galad having liked Nynaeve in Samara but that's it.

Interesting. I honestly didn't know that he'd said that re: Galad/Nynaeve. Will you send me a link to the quote?

I saw it in at least one other interview as well. Can you open this link? If not I'll copy paste x

I'll save the link until after I get off the plane. Thanks! I have real trouble keeping track of all these interviews.
