Man, this Shadow Rising ebook cover really is full of awesome, isn't it?

Mat looks so dark; it's a very stark contrast to his personality.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/47744532028203008)

That was one of my first thoughts too, but he does get grim once in a while. Particularly after being killed...

Another one for the "Huh, never noticed that before" file. Some Aiel tell Mat is death for him to enter Rhuidean. And they're right.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/49631312662900792)

Are they?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49636008735686656)

By Mat's perspective. Though he's not 100% sure.

#### [MANAR](http://twitter.com/thelastgoodkiss/status/49636792835653632)

Wait. No. Mat does not die in Rhuidean, does he? I thought his death came when Rahvin strikes him with lightning.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/49640015344570369)

Mat thinks it counts. Of course, that whole Rahvin thing isn't something he remembers...
