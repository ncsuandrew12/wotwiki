Notice the resonance between the dreaming
*ter'angreal*
and the silver arches in
*The Dragon Reborn*
chapter 22. A hint of things to come in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

Reading Egwene's prophetic dreams in
*The Dragon Reborn*
and smiling at the ones about Mat that recently saw fulfillment. What a long wait. :)

To think, I read this book when it was first published. I was 15. I'm 35 now. I just got to have a hand in seeing the fulfillment.

It's so strange to read these early books, where Egwene is still thinking of Rand half-romantically. And Galad full-romantically.

Wow.
*The Dragon Reborn*
chapter 27 has a cool little foreshadowing for the end of
*A Memory of Light*
that I'd never noticed before.

Oh, Wondergirls. After severe punishment for leaving the Tower without permission, what's their first thought at hearing the Black Ajah is in Tear?

You know, I've always been amazed Mat didn't end up causing more trouble with that letter from Siuan he was given...
