# [Interview #36, Entry #152]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#152)

Really,
*New York Times*
? You couldn't review the book without insulting the rest of the genre? Again?

Also, not every good fantasy needs to be named "Better than Tolkien." That's like starting Broadway reviews with "Better than Shakespeare!"

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/91988837433212928)

It's been fifty years since Tolkien. GRRM's good; your reason he's better is like putting a Lexus over a classic Packard because the Lexus has GPS.

Okay, rant over. In better news, I'm on the plane. Only what...four hours late? Off to Toronto.

Martin > Tolkien

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92062851904192512)

I certainly don't mind if people enjoy Martin more than Tolkien. There are good arguments there.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92062949396594688)

The thing is, it's not a fair comparison for a number of reasons.

#### [RYAN MAXWELL](http://twitter.com/Salkand/status/92015597944184832)

I love RJ, your own books and GRRM's, as well as many, MANY other fantasies. I hated
*Lord of the Rings*
, and I would never suggest them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92063145039892480)

I prefer WoT to Tolkien too—but the thing is, we all owe a lot to the early pioneers in the genre.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92063389119033344)

The problem is the tone of the article, as if implying that Tolkien was a cheap hack and GRRM is the first REAL fantasy worth reading.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92063771492761600)

Just a quick reply to a lot of the tweets I'm getting about the GRRM/Tolkien posts I made earlier.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92063942486142976)

There's absolutely nothing wrong with preferring to read GRRM over Tolkien. I, personally, would generally rather read WOT than
*Lord of the Rings*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92064324872454144)

But a comparison must take into account that we wouldn't have WoT or
*A Song of Ice and Fire*
without Tolkien. That's why the tone of the review was off to me.

#### [BRYCE NIELSEN](http://twitter.com/shnar/status/92064367465594881)

What?!? I have lost all faith in you, preferring WOT over
*Lord of the Rings*
! :P

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/92065163951349760)

Ha. Well, I recognize Tolkien's genius now, but couldn't get into it as a kid. Too tough for me, I think. Didn't read until college.
