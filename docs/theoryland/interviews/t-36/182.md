When writing WoT have you ever read RJ's notes and think that you would have written the plot differently?

I wasn't totally hip on the spanking scene in
*The Gathering Storm*
. There is one other part that was tough. (Can't say now.)

For the most part, though, I didn't look at it that way. If it needed to be changed, I changed it—but only if the plot demanded.

I don't look at this as "how would Brandon do it." I look at it as "How should this work in the Wheel of Time?"

Certainly, I would have written a different series, as I'm a different person. I don't want to impose that here, though.
