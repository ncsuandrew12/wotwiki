I've been reminded by @Darth\_Andrea that I never did tweet this awesome WoT fan art:

A note on that fan art—I don't think @Darth\_Andrea made it. She just tweeted it to me. Find the artist at the deviantart link at the bottom.

Does anyone else find it hard to believe that neither Robert Jordan or @BrandonSandrson has won a Hugo Award?!?

It's sad that RJ never won. I don't even think he got nominated, not for a Hugo or a World Fantasy award.

Does anyone have a transcript of Guy Kay talking about RJ at the World Fantasy awards?

Here's that speech I wanted:

This should be read by every fantasy fan, WoT reader or not. (Also: G.G. Kay is awesome.)
