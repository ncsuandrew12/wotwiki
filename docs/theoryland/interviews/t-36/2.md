# [Interview #36, Entry #2]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#2)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (3 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22021924657831936)

Yes, I will be live tweeting/blogging my re-read. Should have some fun things to post about the WoT as I go.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22025838736179200)

Some are asking if my tweets/blogs will have spoilers for WoT books. I'll try to keep those to a minimum. But there will be some.

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22040266126921730)

Have you considered using a hashtag for your WoT re-read tweets? Would make it easier for fans to follow and participate.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22041162151895040)

Yeah, but I always forget to put in the hashtags...

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22042254520623104)

Pick a hashtag. We can always retweet the stuff you forget to tag. That's what HCFFs are for, right?

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22058845748592640)

Want to join in the re-read fun? @BrandonSandrson is tweeting as he goes. Use this hashtag #wotrr to follow and comment as it progresses.

I want to do the #wotrr with you! What book are you on??

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22496130600280064)

I'm still on Book One. Basically, I'll do 10% of a book a day minimum.

#### [ANNE SOWARDS (5 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/AnneSowards/status/22745619701440512)

I am feeling a crazy urge to re-read Robert Jordan's
*The Eye of the World*
. I blame @BrandonSandrson and his #wotrr tweets.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22755127811121152)

The end of the series draws near. An end of an Age of fantasy reading for many of us.

#### [JASON ROSTAR](http://twitter.com/jrostar/status/22746382376894464)

Does it take you longer to read WoT now than when you first read them? Do you read more carefully since you're 'working'?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22755360402046976)

Yes, much longer.

#### [MATTHEW TIDMAN](http://twitter.com/Espeon200/status/22758433254014977)

The problem with trying to read through The Wheel of Time series for the first time is that it's so huge it's just daunting.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22764191613976576)

First book stands very well on its own, and first three make a solid trilogy. You can read to either point...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22764260211826688)

...and there decide if you want to continue on. It feels less daunting that way.

#### [JAIME CALLAHAN](http://twitter.com/jaimecallahan/status/22758943222661121)

I've never read any of the Wheel of Time books. I think this might put my fantasy book reader street cred in danger.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22764509307338753)

Ha. It's okay. They're fun, though. (I might be biased.)
