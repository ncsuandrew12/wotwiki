The scene of Perrin at the forge in Tear is one of my outright favorites. People often ask if killing characters is tough...

...Yes it is. But writing the
*Towers of Midnight*
scene with Perrin and the hammer he got here in Tear was more emotional for me than most deaths.

I have finished
*The Dragon Reborn*
(finally) on my re-read. Next up, my favorite of the books.
*The Shadow Rising*
.
