# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #80](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#80)

I have six chapters left in
*The Eye of the World*
, should catch up by tonight. What scene are you most looking forward to in
*The Great Hunt*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27028670396768256)

I love the ending. Probably that.

#### [TJ](http://twitter.com/wutdafuhk/status/27033901264277504)

While doing your #wotrr, notice the metaphors. Loved RJ's style there. Not noticed in new book. Great though. Halfway so far.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27043395046215680)

Every time I try to do a Jordan-esque metaphor, I fail, so I remove it. It's an aspect of his style I can't imitate, I'm afraid.

#### [TJ](http://twitter.com/wutdafuhk/status/27046132198678528)

Aw man, I believe you're not giving yourself enough credit, but I'll respect it. Thanks again!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27049302522077185)

I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe I'll figure it out. But often it's better to do things in my style rather than to poorly imitate RJ.

#### [JAN CARRICK](http://twitter.com/Boethius32/status/27082820497186817)

Will you attempt to move closer to RJ's descriptive style in
*A Memory of Light*
? You were close in
*The Gathering Storm*
, but departed from that in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27084946317254656)

I'm afraid I knew from the beginning that I couldn't imitate RJ's style. I try in some ways, but I am not him.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27085057835409408)

I will write the book the best way I know how, but will not be trying to imitate RJ. I WILL strive for character voice accuracy.

#### [JAN CARRICK](http://twitter.com/Boethius32/status/27133636465655809)

Well, the descriptive style is a central feature of WoT. I don't think being more descriptive would constitute imitation.

#### [JAN CARRICK](http://twitter.com/Boethius32/status/27137905524744192)

I'm asking because your narrative style was much closer to RJ in
*The Gathering Storm*
. I was surprised to see you move away from that in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27142236865036289)

Oh, I see. You don't mean "Describe in the way RJ did." You mean "Please describe more."

#### [CHRIS B.](http://twitter.com/dr_jekyll832/status/27067956219355136)

Do you take notes, besides twittering, during #wotrr?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27083964715896832)

Many.

#### [MATT H.](http://twitter.com/NFLHawk/status/27035076516646913)

Can you put all of your notes online somewhere? Come on, that's easy...right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27043607743561728)

Lol. Those would have so many spoilers in them it would cause several people's heads to explode.
