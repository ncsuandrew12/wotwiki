Can both male and females access the True Power? Why does Cadsuane Sedai not question how Rand escapes from being collared?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/24550213368680448)

Yes. And she doesn't have a chance.

#### [DANIEL BEALE](http://twitter.com/Tanacious21/status/24552102474813440)

She doesn't at the time, but afterwards why isn't she curious as to how Rand escaped being collared?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/24565337777246209)

Cadsuane is curious about a lot of things. So yes, you are right. But she also is good at finding answers unexpectedly.
