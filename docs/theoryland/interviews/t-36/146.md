Heya. So. Kind of harsh question—you are reported to have inferred recently that the Black Ajah and Nynaeve etc. ability to...

...to be solid and channel properly during the Dream Battle in
*Towers of Midnight*
has an explanation. Is this true? I struggle...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/76341596324495360)

... to believe that given the text and my communications with Maria, and was wondering if it was misquoted?

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/76343155435372544)

Aight. Literally as I posted the above to Brandon, Maria replied with that this whole issue is a Read and Find Out issue. I'm a douche.

Did anyone check out the ebook to see if any changes have been made to that scene?

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/JamesLuckman/status/76356048176422912)

Don't think so... been chatting with Maria about it and she's not indicated any changes.

#### [MARIA SIMONS](http://twitter.com/MariaLSimons/status/76378348267388928)

Look for an email soon; there were changes. I'm having a difficult day; I didn't think that you might not have seen an ebook.

#### FOOTNOTE

The differences were found and posted

I need to do more #wotrr posts. I've been doing most of reading away from the computer these days; flying or working out. No Twitter handy.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/76745841909563392)

It's okay; we still love you. ;)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/76749541055021056)

Whew. Good to know. :)

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

I found the bit with Luckers after I'd done the 2011 Tweets. By date, it fits here best, but the context is not necessarily significant; I can't insert entries anywhere but at the end of an 'interview' page, but I can edit previous entries, so here it is.
