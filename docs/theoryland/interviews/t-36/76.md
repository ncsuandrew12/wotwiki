Pardon me if this has been asked a million times but what did you find heartbreaking to write in
*Towers of Midnight*
? Noal? Aiel future?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27064222097612800)

Aiel future, all the way. And the death of a certain character related to Perrin.

#### [JEFF EDDE](http://twitter.com/JeffEdde/status/27076141315530752)

Possibly a RAFO, but will you find
*A Memory of Light*
to be even more heartbreaking to write?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/27084657971433472)

It WILL be heartbreaking, if only because it's the last. I can't say if it will be heartbreaking for similar reasons or not.
