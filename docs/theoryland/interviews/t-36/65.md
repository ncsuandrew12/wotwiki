# [Interview #36, Entry #65]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#65)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24535209760268288)

Pop quiz: What is the first thing that makes Perrin hate his axe? (It's something I've always found very interesting about him.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24538273208602625)

It's not Whitecloaks, though that's a good guess. Perrin thinks if the ravens attack, he'll kill Egwene & save her from a worse death.

Ah, I'd forgotten about that. Elyas goading him about it didn't help either, as I recall.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24542829359398912)

Yes, Elyas all but taunted the truth out of him.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24543434761048065)

Regarding how Elyas goads Perrin in that scene: I'm sure he knew exactly what Perrin was thinking, and wanted to make him confront it.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24546046952607744)

Well, yeah. Perrin didn't say anything about what he was thinking. Elyas said it all, exactly what he was thinking.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24546238372253696)

Both his true motivations—choosing her death—and the motivations he feared (which were stupid, of course).

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24547228878110720)

No. Elyas claims that he thinks Perrin hates Egwene. Which is dead wrong, and Elyas knew it.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24547518578696192)

Right, that's what I was saying. Both his true motivations and the stupid ones. Elyas mocks him for the latter.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24547763765121024)

And then spells out what he really wanted: 'One clean blow of your axe, or the way the animals we saw today died?'

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24548099934392320)

It's not that Perrin was thinking he hated her. He was hating himself for wanting to help her, which was dumb.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24549421362446336)

Which of course led to a philosophical conversation similar to Second Amendment debates. Which was ongoing, of course.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24549644964990978)

Did the axe make Perrin more likely to kill? Than before? Than with the hammer? What about the sword, and the spear?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24550028626362368)

I see it as Elyas very blatantly pointing out the flaw in Perrin's logic. He didn't hate her—that was exactly the flaw.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24550604349120512)

Didn't hate her, but he hated the axe, and that was a good thing. Never stopped. (Another good cover @torbooks)
