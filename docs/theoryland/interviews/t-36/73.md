Reading about the Green Man makes me think of the Jordancon costume contest. Look for him in these pics:

One of the Forsaken attacks Lan. Nynaeve's response: Charge in with a knife. That always amused me.

Also, the foreshadowing in this sequence is brilliant. The Green Man speaks of things that become important thousands of pages away.

No, I'm not going to tell you what the VOICE at the end of
*The Eye of the World*
was. Lots of people like to ask, though.

Rand, at the end of
*Eye of the World*
. "Oh, I won't ever touch it again. Not if I have to cut my hand off, first."

The book ends with a short Moiraine viewpoint. That makes four VPs in this book by my count. Rand, Nynaeve, Perrin, Moiraine.
