On to
*The Great Hunt*
today. #Superstars slowed me down over the weekend, but I'm ready to jump back into it.

The
*The Eye of the World*
prologue is the series' best, but the one in
*The Great Hunt today*
(the 'Darkfriend social' as fans call it) has always been a favorite too.

This scene is the first one that made me start to try to figure out who was a Darkfriend and who wasn't.

#### [SHIKHA SINGH](http://twitter.com/SSingh03/status/27058502350409729)

There are no Ogier mentioned at the Darkfriend social. Does that mean there are no Ogier Darkfriends?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/SSingh03/status/27058502350409729)

RAFO.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27044807029293056)

It's much discussed, but if you haven't noticed: Darkfriend social has Aes Sedai, then we learn Moiraine had been mysteriously absent.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27045071085895680)

RJ was very sneaky. This sent the WoT fandom into huge circles of wild-goose-chasing, many thinking Moiraine was a Darkfriend.

Do writers really think about the fan conspiracy theories that much when writing? Seems like J. K. Rowling did a bunch. Do you?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27063683305705473)

RJ certainly did. I do on occasion. Depends on the book.

"Most of the men at Fal Dara accepted Rand...some seemed unable to forget his being an outlander. Masema was the worst of those."

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27062211490881536)

heh. Because Masema thought he was an Aiel! But yeah, the host of series-running characters introduced early...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27062485815140352)

...is well-played. Many in
*The Eye of the World*
, more in
*The Great Hunt today*
. I have wondered if Bunt was RJ's choice or yours for 'Apples'.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/27083662885396480)

Someday, I may answer that question.

#### Footnote

RJ
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=142#5)
in the 2002 Wotmania/Dragonmount Q&A that Ogier can be Darkfriends, but he did not confirm that there are any.
