I've always wondered if it'd be viable when traveling the Ways to leave night, sleep in a random location outside, and go back in.

Maybe time in the Ways is compressed as well as distance? I can't recall if we have enough detail to say.

#### [RUTH HINCKLEY](http://twitter.com/Lironah/status/29995583536107521)

We have plenty of evidence that time is compressed. People seem to move slower when looking out from inside.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/29996842364182528)

Good point. So then it depends on how big of a hurry you are in, I suppose.

I always feel that the chapters Egwene spends as a
*damane*
will last longer than they do. The pain feels like a full book's worth.

Another example of RJ's excellent use of foreshadowing is how he depicts Ingtar all through
*The Great Hunt*
. This often impresses me.

Climbing the wall to escape: "Ingtar cursed when Mat tossed the Horn of Valere...Mat snatched it up,'it isn't even scratched.'"

Yes, I have finished
*The Great Hunt*
. I'm spending a little time outlining now. Lots of work to do there.
