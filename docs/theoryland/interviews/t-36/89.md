A minor query for
*A Memory of Light*
: Will Nieda and Bili get a chance to 'ease the badger' in Tar Valon? A reunion with Domon or Moiraine?

Regarding that 'minor query', I believe Bili is the same Bili (Mandair), Moiraine aided back in
*New Spring*
, chapter six.

RAFO on Bili and Nieda. Sure has been a while since we've seen them, eh?
