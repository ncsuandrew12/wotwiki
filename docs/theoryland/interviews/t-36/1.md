Happy New Year, all. It is official—I have begun working on
*A Memory of Light*
, fourteenth and final book of The Wheel of Time.

I have updated the progress bars on my website with this year's tasks. I'll try to be better about keeping them current.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22011643806351360)

The first step is to re-read the entire Wheel of Time.
*Towers of Midnight*
had some small continuity errors—mostly me forgetting who knows what.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22011799251451905)

We fixed them for the paperback, but it is a sign that I'm starting to forget details. That means I need to re-read Mr. Jordan's work.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22082084151492609)

I fully expect this re-read to take until April. I need to divide my time among reading, outlining, and studying the notes.

By the way, I did get a Nook for my birthday. So I'm in the process of getting e-copies of the WoT uploaded.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22017227377090560)

Since people are asking, the continuity errors were things like Grady telling Perrin about the Cleansing as if for the first time, but...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22017426426171392)

...there's a line in
*Knife of Dreams*
where Perrin notes that they'd mentioned it to him. We don't see the conversation, but it's there in narrative.

#### [AJ ZAETHA](http://twitter.com/AJZaethe/status/22016877073010688)

Need a devout reader of the Wheel of Time to watch over what you are writing so they can be like: "He died in book five." "oh."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22017696031838208)

The thing is, I had eight of those for
*Towers of Midnight*
. They all missed these too. It was the time crunch that did it to us, I think.

#### [BENJAMIN PEACOCK](http://twitter.com/bepeacock/status/22016233062797313)

No biggie, but did you fix for ebook by chance?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22017759000920064)

Yes, it should be all fixed for the ebook.

#### [MICHELLE ANDERS](http://twitter.com/C3Zinger/status/22024051199315968)

Also the fact that Min's viewings aren't always around Aes Sedai when they are supposed to be.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22025516924014592)

I'm working on the assumption (as she's said before) that she doesn't always pay attention to them, as there's so many of them.

#### [CHRIS NUCCITELLI (7 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/slothdog/status/23507256414830592)

Is there a list somewhere of the continuity changes made for the
*Towers of Midnight*
paperback?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/23514613857394688)

Not yet. Many things fans pointed out weren't actually errors, but the Theoryland thread caught most of the things we changed.
