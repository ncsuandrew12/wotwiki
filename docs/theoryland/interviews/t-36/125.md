People are asking for info about the WoT LARP at Vericon. It was written by several members, and was very extensive.

It was set 500 years before the book series, and involved the political situation around a Shadowspawn invasion and a false Dragon.

As I understand, the Darkfriends won. The Amyrlin got stilled and the new one unwittingly picked Black Ajah as Keeper.

Can you help me understand what the LARP project you spoke about is? I was intrigued.

Live Action Role Playing. Basically, people take the roles of characters in the game. (Warders, ambassadors, and Aes Sedai.)

Then they play a game where they try to achieve different goals. Like a much more extensive "how to host a murder" game.
