This might be old news, but people keep asking me about it. Yes there ARE Dreamers among the Forsaken. Male and female.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/56468552722546689)

One male AND one female Forsaken are Dreamers?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/56470317454987264)

There are multiple Dreamers. At least one male and at least one female.

#### Footnote

This might have been in response to the previous conversation about Moghedien. She and Lanfear are the top candidates for the female Dreamers, and Moridin is the obvious choice for the men, since skill in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
and skill in invading others' dreams seem to be concurrent with the Talent of prophetic dreams. See

for more details.
