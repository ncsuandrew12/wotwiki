Is there any chance to see Moiraine & Siuan like that in the near future? :P

Ha. Well, considering events in
*The Gathering Storm*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
, I wouldn't expect it.

You know we expect so much from a Moiraine/Siuan meeting, don't you? Cause there'll be a meeting between them in
*A Memory of Light*
, right? :P

Oh, I know. No promises, but at least I'm aware.
