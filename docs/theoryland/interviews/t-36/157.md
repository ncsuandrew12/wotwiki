It's official: Construct theory wins.

(Sorry @BrandSanderson ...sort of, anyway. :p) (It was out there, so...)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 August 2010)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/101499251930038274)

Construct theory? Should I know what that is?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/#!/Terez27/status/101499987569020928)

Nope, it's a secret. :p (The Lews Therin debate - real/construct; another person/delusion caused by insanity and memories).

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

This led to a flurry of tweets between me and Luckers, none of which Brandon responded to, but he did have to step in at one point with an email to assure us that he didn't get in trouble with Team Jordan in any way for the GeekDad interview I linked. (It seemed the most logical explanation for his subsequent clamming up on the issue, and still does really, but it's the official word.) It's also at least a little bit likely that he was hedging on not knowing what construct theory is.
