Who was the Lord of Chaos that Demandred and Taim both mention? There has been tons of debate.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/23110029808766976)

Really? I thought that one was obvious. What's the debate about?

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23111139776798720)

It's Rand. Look in the BWB re: Feast of Fools.

#### [Austin Moore](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/23111811586850816)

Why was Demandred and Taim saying, "Let the Lord of Chaos rule" if it was Rand? Sorry just read through series once so far :(

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23116782382350337)

Here's a quote for you:

**The Feast of Fools**
  
Celebrated in Tammaz (in Arad Doman and the Borderlands) or Saven (everywhere else), the exact day varying according to locality. A day in which all order is deliberately inverted; the high perform lowly tasks (running errands, serving at table, etc.) while the low do no work and give orders to their usual superiors. In many villages and towns the most foolish person is given a title such as the Lord/Lady of Unreason/Misrule/Chaos or the King/Queen of Fools. Not an honor sought, but for that one day everyone has to obey whatever orders, however foolish, are given by the chosen one. (Called the Festival of Unreason in Saldaea; the Festival of Fools in Kandor; Foolday in Baerlon and the Two Rivers.)

I've always enjoyed
[this theory](http://www.theoryland.com/theories.php?func=5&rec=131&theo=2372)
about the Lord of Chaos. It's fun.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/23134489924337666)

That is a good theory for people to be reading.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23134900395712513)

YAY. OMG, that theory has been on the rocks for years because of contradicting tour reports.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23135284740751360)

Also, your tour quotes were vague enough to allow it but most people didn't see it that way.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/23141119118278656)

I didn't say the theory was true, just that you should study it. :) But I would like to see those tour reports.

#### [Terez](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23143466997391360)

Yes, yes. :) Also, your
[vague(ish) wording](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#24)
. And the
[contradicting](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=731#1)
[RJ reports.](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=730#1)

#### Footnote

Adding to Brandon's implications here is Sorilea's comment in reference to the balefiring of Natrin's Barrow, in
*The Gathering Storm*
Chapter 27: "We felt the world warping from here, but did not know what had caused it. We assumed it to be the Dark One's work." (Similar to the ripples Perrin and Faile experienced in
*Knife of Dreams*
.) This opens up the possibility that people
[have no idea really](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204#6)
what they're talking about when they assume that the warping of reality is due to the Dark One's touch, just as Alviarin had no idea what she was talking about when she assumed that the
[rotting food](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=474#3)
was the Dark One's touch (
*Knife of Dreams*
, Prologue).
