It's interesting to see how much Loial adds to these scenes. His personality is a balancing factor; calm, knowledgeable, not arrogant.

And yet, Loial disappears in the end game. Please bring him back for the finale!

The Wheel Weaves as the Wheel Wills, and I do as I must.

Is it hard for you to still enjoy the series now that you are "behind the scenes"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/25295714850443264)

I think I enjoy it more, now, actually. Though I am a little sad not to be able to read new WoT books when everyone else does.
