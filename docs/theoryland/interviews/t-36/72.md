It's interesting to see how much Loial adds to these scenes. His personality is a balancing factor; calm, knowledgeable, not arrogant.

And yet, Loial disappears in the end game. Please bring him back for the finale!

Is it hard for you to still enjoy the series now that you are "behind the scenes"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/25295714850443264)

I think I enjoy it more, now, actually. Though I am a little sad not to be able to read new WoT books when everyone else does.
