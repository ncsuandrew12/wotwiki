Nynaeve is a divisive force among WoT fans. Yes, she likes to call men wool-headed. Next time you read, though, watch her actions.

She often speaks in a way influenced by her culture. But if you watch her body language and intent, she's a very different person.

An excellent example of this is her conversation with Rand in
*The Eye of the World*
16. She very reasonable, empathetic, and treats Rand as an adult.

Yes, she calls all men wool-headed. If you want to understand Nynaeve, see these comments as kin to a Seanchan "May she live forever".

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23103771559075840)

Sure, she means them. Kind of. But mostly, they're just things you say when you are part of her culture.

Its not just Nynaeve though, there's not a main character who is a woman who doesn't voice these sentiments at least once...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23107648148742144)

That's why I argue it's cultural. Makes sense in a culture where men who have magic are a danger, but women are a resource.

#### [MIGNON FOGARTY](http://twitter.com/GrammarGirl/status/23146158222217216)

I find Nynaeve very annoying. She's such an irrational pill.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23148568139276288)

Lol. I can't help seeing her, even still, as a big sister.

"Dresses were not made for stalking."—Nynaeve, trying to sneak while wearing one. Gender roles are fascinating in the WoT. For example...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23463477251149824)

Harriet edits so we're careful to use non-gender-specific terms. Fisher instead of fishermen, as that's the preferred WoT usage.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23463925265731584)

The world has blatant sexism on both sides, and yet, at the same time there's far more gender equality than found in most cultures.
