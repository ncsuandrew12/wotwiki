You know, I remember thinking Nynaeve was jumping at nothing when suspecting a certain Aes Sedai following the Gray Man attack.

Any clue you can give us on who sent the Gray Man to kill Egwene and Nynaeve in
*The Dragon Reborn*
? I've always wondered about that.

I'll get you an answer to that someday.

I'm finding Nynaeve less annoying as her character develops.

She's always been my favorite of the Elayne-Egwene-Nynaeve group.
