Still working away at
*The Dragon Reborn*
. Will be going to the dentist for checkup soon. I might get some reading time in there.

So, I got recognized four times today while out. Feels strange. If it happens so often to me, I wonder how often it happens to a real celebrity

Dude in the next dental stall, I apologize for how your hygienist jumped when she heard my name...then left you with mouth open as she ran over.

Do you mind it, or do you prefer to be left alone?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 MARCH)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42694708467736576)

I honestly don't mind; it's just a little strange.

You probably need to think of an alias. How about Sander Brandson, or San Branderson... \*grins\*

I've half been tempted to write a book as "Sand Branderson" before.

Wondering if you have tried the audiobooks, and if they do not suit your purpose, why?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 MARCH)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42694007230447616)

I have; I like them. But I like reading on the page better.

#### [KENADAK (28 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/kenadak/status/42436318319480832)

Could you please indicate with a hash tag what book you're on during the #wotrr #TGH as it were.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 MARCH)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42722646558916608)

I give indications now and then. I can't add a hashtag for each book as I already feel I'm low on characters for my tweets.
