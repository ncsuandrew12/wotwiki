A signing report implies that you said that RJ changed his mind on whether balefire = eternal death of soul. This true?

Here is a direct link to that particular report:

@Blindillusion13 is unable to clarify.

I always assumed what you really said (or really meant) was that you had believed it was the eternal death of the soul...

...but then when you joined Team Jordan you learned differently (you said elsewhere that @MariaLSimons had to convince you).

You have the right of it, Terez. I always believed that balefire = Eternal Death.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/108314088240726016)

Team Jordan instructed me that this was not the case, and balefire meant the Dark One could not recover the soul.
