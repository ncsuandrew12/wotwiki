Can Rand get the most POVs in
*A Memory of Light*
, please? (bambi eyes, clasped hands) We were severely deprived in
*Towers of Midnight*
. :'( (grovels)

There will be more Rand VPs in the last book, I promise.

Rand's lack of VPs in
*Towers of Midnight*
was intentional. Much like his lessened VP role in
*The Dragon Reborn*
, and for similar reasons.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/22078346380705792)

Was the lack of Rand VPs in
*Towers of Midnight*
intended to show his change from other characters' VPs?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22082546674176001)

In part. There are other reasons. But that's part of it.
