*Grolm*
make me think of the plush
*grolm*
Baby Meatloaf has. (It was a hand-made gift. There's a pic on my twitter feed somewhere.)

Ah, nice. @Terez27 dug up that picture I posted of Baby Meatloaf w/his stuffed
*grolm*
. Aubree [Pham] was the one who gave it to him, I think.

Here he is:

Man, he had curly hair back then.

No, Rand. Lady Selene isn't suspicious AT ALL.

Did RJ ever explain her trick? I know she enhances her appearance, but is there an element of light Compulsion to it?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28581468196306945)

As far as I know, she didn't use Compulsion.

Memory's vague on this but why doesn't Lews Therin recognize Selene? Mirror of mists? Lews Therin not aware yet?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28581688598597632)

So far as I know, Lews Therin wasn't 'aware' yet. At least, not enough for something like that.

Lots of responses Re: Rand and Lady Selene. Let me say this. Yes, Rand is being a wool-headed fool. But I remember being that young.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28553088663031808)

I remember when I realized the prettiest girl I knew was also a huge jerk. It was a stunning revelation. Yet it took two years to make.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28555247458721793)

Rand is not the first teenage boy to have trouble seeing the obvious in a situation like this. In fact, it would be odd otherwise.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28566004787318785)

Egwene to Elayne on their first meeting in the White Tower, right before meeting Min: "Rand seems to meet a lot of girls." Yup.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28574757356052480)

First Min viewpoint is at the halfway mark to
*The Great Hunt*
. I'm always amazed by how many viewpoints we get before Mat gets one.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28575306969260032)

I have to look back a long time, back almost twenty years, to remember that originally, I saw Mat as a side character—and this is why.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/28579803296694272)

I've always felt that Thom should be more surprised, excited, or...something to see Rand again here in
*The Great Hunt*
when they meet.
