When Egwene dreams of Perrin, Faile and "a Tinker", why didn't she know it was Aram although she knows him personally?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (18 March 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/48802200784343040)

The dreams aren't always that specific. She might not have seen a face, or recognized it.

I'd have to look at the specific passage to know which it is.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/48810304058036224)

[after looking at said passage] That is an oddity, I'll admit. But dreams are not always clear, as I've said. I lay my bet on his face simply wasn't clear.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/48810409850961920)

There are good reasons for that—for example, Aram's place in the Pattern may not have been as set as Perrin's.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/48810544412639233)

A fuzziness to accompany the uncertainty, so Egwene couldn't recognize him. After all, she doesn't describe the face.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

I think Brandon might have been trying to drop hints about the dream of Egwene being saved by a Seanchan woman (the sword is as solid as the stone, but the face wavers). Sometimes fuzziness in
[dreams](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/prophecies/dreams.html)
doesn't mean any uncertainty; Bair and Melaine couldn't see Aviendha's, Elayne's, and Min's faces in the dream where they were on the boat with Rand, but Nicola's Foretelling confirms that they are the three. (Foretellings are absolute, while dreams show only possibilities that can often be prevented.) Perhaps a better question is, why didn't Egwene remember anything about Perrin being a Wolfbrother in
*The Dragon Reborn*
?
