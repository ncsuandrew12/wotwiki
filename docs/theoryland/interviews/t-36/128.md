I just passed the Perrin/Faile in the ways sequence. Like Egwene in the leash, this one always feels longer in my mind than it is.

Funny, that we should find this—one of my least favorite sequences—right in the middle of my favorite book in the series.

Dannil just joined Perrin. If you missed it, he's (kind of) the one who was the fourth Two Rivers boy on the cover of
*The Eye of the World*
