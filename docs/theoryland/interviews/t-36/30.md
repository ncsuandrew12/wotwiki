# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#30)

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (5 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22728503791190017)

People (mostly my editor) complain about my capitalization of magic-related terms. (Push and Pull in Mistborn.) I learned from RJ.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22729097675284480)

I'll admit, keeping track of which terms are upper case while writing these can be hard. Warder, for example, is capitalized.

Ha. I love @GrammarGirl. She says: "Refer your editor to the section on capitalizing Platonic ideals:

When younger, I thought Rand's first Channeling was lightning in Four Kings. It wasn't until later that I caught the Bela thing.

No, 'channeling' is NOT capitalized. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22755594561658880)

That's the one I most think should be. We always have to search/replace it after I write a book.

Why did you use the word 'magic' in
*Towers of Midnight*
? It never showed up in WoT before that.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22748100116357120)

RJ used the word a couple of times in the series.

#### [SHIVAM BHATT](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/22749732912758784)

Did he? Because I remember being jarred out of the narrative when I saw it mentioned in
*Towers of Midnight*
. Seemed really incongruous.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/22759168343539712)

Yeah, a couple of times. Mostly in earlier books. In Aviendha's vision, though, it was supposed to be incongruous.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22759286690025472)

This is (presumably) many, many years in the future. Language and usage has changed.

#### Footnote

The word 'magic' was actually only used once (in
*The Eye of the World*
Chapter 33). Brandon used 'magics' in
*Towers of Midnight*
Chapter 48 in Aviendha's POV, but he also used 'magical' in Faile's POV in
*Towers of Midnight*
Chapter 16 (neither word appears anywhere else in the series).
