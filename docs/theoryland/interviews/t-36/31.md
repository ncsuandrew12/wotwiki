# [Interview #36, Entry #31]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#31)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22745128175140864)

This now reads interestingly: "With all his heart & desperation, he silently shouted at Bela to run...tried to will strength into her...

#### [ZEERAK WASEEM](http://twitter.com/zeerakw/status/22744644156653568)

The Bela thing?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22753724095004672)

Rand heals Bela of her fatigue before Moiraine can.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22754670673924097)

Since people are asking, Rand's first use of the Power is healing Bela of her fatigue. He feels the effects later in Baerlon, I think.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22754860856250370)

Are there any Theorylanders/Dragonmounters who can confirm this for me? Maybe give some specifics or a thread for people?

#### [ADAM PETTY](http://twitter.com/AdamMPetty/status/22755646222901250)

Didn't Moiraine bring that to his attention at the end of
*The Eye of the World*
or
*The Dragon Reborn*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22761806636253184)

I think she did, but either way, I missed it first read-through.

#### [JO KENEBEL](http://twitter.com/ask4thesea/status/22757360757907457)

Actually doesn't Moiraine confirm it later, she says something like "I had suspicions from the first...then there was Bela..."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22763963234127872)

I was asking for confirmation on his sickness, not whether he channeled. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22758532516421632)

On the subject of Rand's channeling, a lot of people are bringing up the event on the ship outside of Shadar Logoth.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22758818232406016)

I'll talk about this when we get there. I've read a lot of theories on this one arguing for both sides. I've never made up my mind.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22761719780605952)

Wotfaq on Rand channeling:
<http://bit.ly/fBBrCz>
I've read enough questions from theory-types on the second one to make me question.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22762620037636097)

Like what? Seems pretty straightforward to me.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22762690208333825)

And...Linda to the rescue. Once again, 13th Depository has an exhaustive look at all this:

(Thanks @einarjh.)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22763510576455680)

She doesn't question it either. :D I have not seen a case against it. Also, Vin using up her 'luck' reminded me of that. :)

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22764054892253184)

Brandon, come on over. We'd love to "entertain" your theory against Bela. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22778308001275904)

My theory against Bela?

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22779035067092992)

Thought "theories on this one arguing for both sides. I've never made up my mind" meant you were undecided on Bela...

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/22779317813518337)

...as the first instance of channeling. But now I see you were speaking of the sickness.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22779542066171904)

The ship is what I was talking about. I remember reading, in the early days, some people trying to refute that one.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22779306862182402)

The reason everyone misses the first times Rand channels is because the sickness after the lightning is so much more memorable.

#### [HBFFERREIRA](http://twitter.com/HBFFerreira/status/22779422029381632)

The mast swinging and killing a Trolloc, right? I remember thinking
*ta'veren*
during my re-read.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22781856571203584)

That's what I thought for a long time too. Might still think it. I want to watch it this read.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/22847555343749120)

Re: Rand's first channelings—do you know of the theory that Rand channeled to bring them to the Eye...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/22847879282429952)

Compare the last few moments before they reach the Eye with when Rand heals Bela of her tiredness.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/22849515056791552)

If that is one of the first channelings, it's not on any list. Always intrigued me. RJ was so subtle sometimes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22939732698730496)

I'll watch for that, Luckers. Thanks for the heads up.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (7 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23465609161342977)

Okay, we come to Rand using the One Power to swing the boom on the ship and hit the Trolloc. The argument against this one...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23466012254932992)

...is that the Power doesn't actually seem to move the boom. The boat shakes for some reason, which swings it down.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23466274981941248)

In the other two cases, Rand does something actively. In this, it seems more accidental. It's enough of an argument to make me wonder.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23508633534865408)

Who says Rand didn't shake the boat with the Power? Besides, the aftereffects are what make us sure.

#### [LINDA TAGLIERI](http://twitter.com/zemaille/status/23521327600111616)

I agree. He jolted the boat which dislodged many Trollocs and the boom swept the one attacking him away.

#### [JOHN IN PUEBLO](http://twitter.com/pueblonative/status/23474040484139008)

Are you saying him being
*ta'veren*
caused it to move?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23475105489223680)

I'm saying I've been made to wonder. The biggest point against it is the sickness he feels after.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (10 JANUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24521161152921600)

So, Rand on the rigging really must be an after-effect of channeling. But it doesn't HAVE to mean he did it on the night with the boat.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24521332934840320)

It could have happened in the days between, and... and I'm sounding like @theoryland, aren't I? You guys are a bad influence on me.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24523480137469952)

If you actually hung out @theoryland you would never put such an unsupported theory forward for fear of our scorn. ;)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24523713756004352)

Sometimes, Occam's Razor is your friend. Alas.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24525063210401792)

Ha. You want me to think your theories are all well-supported? You think I haven't heard @theoryland's Avi theory?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24525425766047744)

Hey, that was MY theory. And it was way more supported than yours! hmph... (though I didn't believe it really)

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/24527926447833088)

Ouch. I should get Jenn to do an Asmodean panel at JordanCon. I need an outlet for my glossary disdain.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24528945588207616)

While all of us in the
[apathy camp](http://www.theoryland.com/factions.php?func=4&rec=61)
think the glossary reveal was JUST PERFECT TAKE THAT YOU CHUMPS.

#### [MATT HATCH](http://twitter.com/Theoryland/status/24530889287409664)

Of course you were happy, because it was the apathetic way to reveal it...I really need that panel, Jenn!

#### [JENNIFER LIANG](http://twitter.com/dragonmount/status/24543771987279872)

Tell Shannan. I think we have room for another theory panel.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24528354661105664)

Also, Moiraine clearly says that early unconscious channeling always comes in response to a desperate need.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24528492179755008)

We know it was smooth sailing after they left Shadar Logoth, so no opportunity to make Rand channel.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24529142401732610)

Where did you get the idea that this was my theory? Just something I was curious about. :P

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/#%21/Terez27/status/24529891655417856)

Just from the fact that you were, you know, defending it. :p I know you said you had read it back in the day though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24531029855305728)

Unfortunately, I don't really GET to have theories any more, since I can just look up the answers or ask Maria. :(

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24531250958041089)

And the theories I do have I don't really get to post about, since they will influence the series end. Maybe once
*A Memory of Light*
is done,

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/#%21/BrandonSandrson/status/24531364430741504)

I'll pick a few things the notes are silent on, explain that they're silent, then jump in with some good, old-fashioned theories.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24531912357838850)

That won't stop me from making random comments as I read, though, so maybe those count as my theories.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24532096047382528)

I am keeping a list, though, to get answers on as I go. Already got a few, actually....

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24532136329478144)

That would be awesome. In the meantime, feel free to defend silly theories. It gives us something to do. ;)
