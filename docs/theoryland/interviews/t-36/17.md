Back to reading
*The Eye of the World*
, all. Posts to follow. I'll try to keep it at a steady stream, not a flood.

WoT Easter Egg: there's an easily overlooked line in the prologue of
*The Eye of the World*
which gives huge foreshadowing of things Rand can do in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

I always thought the fact that Lews Therin could sense that there were no people around for miles was interesting.

I should have guessed that you'd be the only one who would pick out the right line, Terez.

The Easter egg in the prologue has to do with Lews Therin sensing the lack of people around him for miles and miles.

Regarding yesterday's Easter Egg, Maria mentions RJ was preparing a blog post on the concept.

For those who missed it, it has to do with Lews Therin sensing nobody was nearby when he made Dragonmount.

And before you ask, no, I can't say more. Sorry. Suffice it to say that what is in the books stands as enough of an answer, for now.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/22945452735340544)

My original(ish) post on the ability to sense for people:
<http://bit.ly/safegates>
in '06. I was a noob(ish) then.

Interesting theory. What do you think of it now?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23111281166778369)

I think it still holds up (despite a few details I missed), but I think it's not what you were getting at. :)

#### Footnote

Most think this has something to do with the 'one with the land' thing. (See the Fisher King tag for more info.)
