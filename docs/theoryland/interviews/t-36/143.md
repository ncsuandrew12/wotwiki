Can you settle a debate? Will Rand's soul be the Light's champion in every Age, or could it ever be someone else?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/62616758506356737)

I believe that Ishamael implies in the books he and Lews Therin have fought thousands of times.

So at least one major character seems to believe it's always Rand. Whether he's right or not is another question.

#### Footnote

Brandon is reported as having said on tour that Ishamael's and Rand's souls are often woven together in the Pattern, somewhat like Birgitte and Gaidal.
