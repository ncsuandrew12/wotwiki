Can you settle a debate? Will Rand's soul be the Light's champion in every Age, or could it ever be someone else?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 April 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/62616758506356737)

I believe that Ishamael implies in the books he and Lews Therin have fought thousands of times.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/62616859282907136)

So at least one major character seems to believe it's always Rand. Whether he's right or not is another question.

#### Footnote

Brandon is reported as having said on tour that Ishamael's and Rand's souls are often woven together in the Pattern, somewhat like Birgitte and Gaidal.
