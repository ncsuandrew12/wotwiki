Do you know if a WOT film or TV series is on the cards at all?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (21 October 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127578129542815744)

Possible. Universal Pictures has the rights, and I've visited and talked with them on several occasions.

Been hearing some rumors/wishes on Wheel of Time movies, true? if so will it be done well?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/129022103268765696)

The rights have been sold. But, like anything in Hollywood, it could take a lot of time to get a film made.

Who have they been sold to? And is anyone from Team Jordan supervising? So it doesn't turn out like
*Eragon*
did.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/129063013473980417)

Universal has the rights. They've brought me in several times to consult. I'm sure Team Jordan will be involved.
