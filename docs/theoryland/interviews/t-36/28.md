Can you just re-read books 1-5 over and over so we can keep talking about Moiraine?

#### DEADSY

If not that, perhaps I can try to force you to dwell on later mentions of Moiraine, no matter how unimportant.

#### DEADSY

...and it took me a long time but I've narrowed the "something" about Moiraine down to the fact she rarely uses contractions.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (5 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22724592099401728)

Let me know what you find. One thing to note—RJ didn't use contractions in narrative, but I do. A stylistic difference.

#### [DEADSY](http://twitter.com/Janasedai/status/22783404151939073)

I noticed it in
*The Great Hunt*
with Moiraine and Siuan. Siuan uses them left and right because she's not uppity enough to say "do not".

It's a good point, and probably part of that Cairhienin reserve. Or at least, it helps portray it.

#### Footnote

Deadsy had mentioned before that she found something 'off' about Moiraine. Also, not much later the graphic novel version of
*New Spring*
was released, and in it was a correspondence between RJ and the Dabel Brothers, and he
[mentions](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=252#6)
that Moiraine never uses contractions.
