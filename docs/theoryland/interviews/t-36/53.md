I love that in our second Perrin viewpoint ever, he's already grumbling about being made a leader—right after expertly taking charge.

Hm. Never noticed that before. First time Perrin sees Elyas's eyes: "Some memory tickled the back of Perrin's mind." Thoughts?

Perrin later dismisses this premonition as simply "Oh, I was thinking of wolf eyes." But I wonder. Was he a Wolfbrother in past lives?

RJ said that Wolfbrotherness is a soul trait.

So, possible, though it wouldn't be a recent life.

Well, that depends. I know a lot of fans believe that in most cases, lives are once per Age, with the soul going somewhere between.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23514014306795520)

I can't remember if RJ ever said anything on this.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/#%21/Terez27/status/23514341798060032)

Yeah, but Birgitte lived several lives in this Age. I always assumed it was because she can't channel (shorter lifespan).
