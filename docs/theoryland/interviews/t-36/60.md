Is it error when Elyas told Perrin [in
*The Eye of the World*
] chapter 29 that no Hawkwing's kin stayed in Randland? (Mayene's Firsts claim kinship)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/24576499445145600)

I haven't looked at it specifically, but my guess would be that Elyas doesn't know or believe the claims.
