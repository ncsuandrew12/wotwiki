Has Demandred even been doing anything important besides building an army? (guessing it's in Murandy)

He's been doing lots of important things.

Why do you think RJ straight up said that Taim wasn't Demandred when he could've just said RAFO and kept everyone guessing?

I think he was tired of people all looking in the same place.
