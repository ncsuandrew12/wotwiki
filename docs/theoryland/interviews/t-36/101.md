# [Interview #36, Entry #101]: Twitter 2011 (WoT)](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#101)

#### [John Anderson (24 February 2011)](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/40950563046825984)

Given how RJ went to great length in an attempt to synchronize his plotlines before the finale, don't you feel that you had...

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/40951465547800576)

...an obligation not to destabilize the chronology the way you ended up doing? With all due respect, I think time has shown...

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/40951665314119681)

...that it was a massive mistake structuring
*The Gathering Storm*
/
*Towers of Midnight*
the way you did. Which is a shame, since your WoT-writing is GOOD.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 February 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41250942980599808)

I'm afraid I don't follow you. The plotlines
[weren't](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=178#5)
[synchronized](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=147#3)
in
[previous WoT books](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=123#26)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41251764472778752)

I realize there may be disagreement, and am not offended by it. But I maintain that the structure of
*The Gathering Storm*
/
*Towers of Midnight*
is the right one.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41252034892148736)

I only had two choices with
*The Gathering Storm*
. Have a book more like
*Crossroads of Twilight*
with lots of slices of all characters, but without complete arcs for any...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41252218984349696)

Or do what I did, and make a Rand/Egwene book and a Mat/Perrin book with some time jumping.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41252410731151360)

Of course, this wouldn't have been a problem if it would have been possible to do a single, 600k word volume.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON (26 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41643938054025216)

No, but the books showed that RJ was trying to synchronize the plotlines for the finale—sometimes at the reader's expense.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41644074847051776)

This, combined with RJ's statements that the finale would need to be one book, suggests to me that he had a very strong wish...

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41644296528596992)

...to tell the final part of the story in a more traditional chronological manner. Of course, this couldn't be published in...

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41644515563548672)

...one volume, but the story still could've been told the way RJ wanted it to be told. The story just loses so much due to...

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41644795160051712)

...this division. Take Rand and Perrin's scene at Dragonmount, for example. I feel these scenes were MEANT to be told in parallel.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41644934121525248)

...as opposed to one year and 500 pages apart.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41645308433793024)

I believe that a slow
*The Gathering Storm*
and fast-paced
*Towers of Midnight*
would've been by far the best choice from a literary point of view.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41645433495371776)

This would also lead to fewer continuity errors and better coherence in terms of both themes and action.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41645655806058496)

The biggest mistake, for me, was the insistence on publishing before you had the full overview, i.e. before you had written...

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41647212354207744)

...the whole part of the story that needed to be divided. The result is a structural mess far worse than
*Crossroads of Twilight*
. No offense.:)

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41648223034687488)

What annoys me is that you write WoT so well that this could've been a spectacular ending if told the way I feel RJ wanted.

#### [JOHN ANDERSON](http://twitter.com/cjunct1/status/41649432181215232)

I would very much like to hear what you think about this. I'm disappointed at the way this was done, but mean no offense.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (28 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42343032338644993)

No offense taken. You have some points. For the Hardcore breaking the book mid-story may have been better.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42343189214019584)

However, the average WoT fan would have found those books a much less rewarding experience.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42343305027125248)

In a perfect world, we could have delayed another year and just released them one after another, two months apart.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42343399063429120)

Then I could have cut the books as you suggest. That wasn't viable, however, because of the constraints placed upon me.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42343542726733824)

One of those constraints is that
*The Gathering Storm*
HAD to be a homerun. It had to be extremely powerful, not slow.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42343682552242176)

It had been years since a WoT book, and with a new writer working on it...well, we just couldn't have a slow half-book.

#### [COLIN WILSON (26 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/LordJuss/status/41600369830281216)

I agree with having complete arcs in
*The Gathering Storm*
but why interweave chapters in
*Towers of Midnight*
? Why not catch up first? (interested, not cross)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41638621245218816)

I tried to do so, but the book was feeling 'off' by sticking Perrin's narrative all at the front. Beyond that, chapter one had to be Rand.

#### [JAN CARRICK](http://twitter.com/Boethius32/status/41679340722860033)

Why did Rand have to be in chapter one? To me, knowing he was alright pretty much killed the suspension of the other characters' threads.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (28 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42428151862796289)

Hard to explain. It was simply the place that scene had to go.

#### [HBFFERREIRA (27 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/HBFFerreira/status/41802860169662464)

Both novels gave us closure for some plots, instead of
*The Gathering Storm*
giving us none. For what it's worth, I think you did great.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (28 FEBRUARY)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/42428444323233793)

Thanks. I didn't think it was that hard to follow. The only potential problem is Tam.

#### Footnote

Tam was the biggest problem for the more casual fans, but the hard core fans tended to have a bigger problem with the separation between Rand's and Perrin's points of view at Dragonmount. But you had something similar with several groups experiencing the cleansing of
*saidin*
, in one way or another, in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
.
