# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #165](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#165)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (7 NOVEMBER 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/133773793335324673)

Wheel of time fans. Big news for you. We are going to do a great hunt this tour. Details to come on my website soon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/133780372008861696)

I will give out the first Great Hunt Code at the midnight release tonight. I will tweet how you can get it soon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (8 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/133808903094927360)

Want the Great Hunt clue? I'm thinking of a WoT character who has a viewpoint for the 1st time in
*A Memory of Light*
. Make a guess in person here at BYU.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/133809196570382336)

First person to guess right IN PERSON to me tonight gets the clue. One guess each. Good luck!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/133823139783262209)

Nobody has guessed the name right yet for the code. If you have a guess, and you know someone here, call them and have them ask.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/133809684946759680)

So @BrandSanderson is doing #wotgh again. Don't forget the tag. If you're at his signing guess Taim or Logain. One or the other guaranteed.

#### [GLEN GARETS](http://twitter.com/GlenGarets/status/133997524234158080)

Wrong. It was Tam al'Thor.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/134124977250242560)

Do you know who got the clue?

#### [GLEN GARETS](http://twitter.com/GlenGarets/status/134133928540901377)

My friend Kyle and I.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/134139452967747584)

But did @BrandSanderson give you a code to enter on his website? That's what he did last time, and it looks like it's entered.

#### [GLEN GARETS](http://twitter.com/GlenGarets/status/134147531570552832)

Well then I guess you know that gave him one then...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/133826056879751168)

It has been guessed. The character with a viewpoint for the first time in
*A Memory of Light*
is Tam.

#### [17 SHARD](http://twitter.com/17thshard/status/134129128759758848)

I got a picture of him with Brandon and the code, but no name.—Kerry

#### [17TH SHARD](http://twitter.com/17thshard/status/134416532313882624)

Here's a pic of the clue itself:

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (9 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134366717676765184)

I put up a blog post about the new Wheel of Time Great Hunt that kicked off Tuesday morning. http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1032/New-Wheel-of-Time-Great-Hunt

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134382934332424192)

I will have a couple #wotgh codes for the signing today. However, until then, know that several of these are very guessable...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134383337073684480)

I will give out the first Great Hunt Code at the midnight release tonight. I will tweet how you can get it soon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134425024093364224)

San Diego airport bookstore (near Gate 35) has signed Alloy of Law and Towers. No #wotgh clues, as it is behind security.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134425495814152192)

If I do hide one behind security, I'll pick a major hub. A former Stormleader did find me here and ask for a code. (I gave her one.)

#### [KATIE FREY](http://twitter.com/leiyansedai/status/134426791531126784)

Thanks for code #2 @BrandSanderson!! See you at the signing! =D

#### [KATIE](http://twitter.com/leiyansedai/status/134432355329916931)

Code Number 2: TREES BY COUNTRY

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134456101084209152)

First person who guesses the name of the first viewpoint in the
*A Memory of Light*
prologue and tells me in person gets a code.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134456437056352258)

This will be hard as they are a new character. So guess who they work for, and that will be enough.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134488257810542592)

For the clue: this person is in someone's army. Guess which army. I don't know if you will get it tonight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134493640260198401)

You have to ask in person for this clue, guys.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134504003651383296)

Nobody guessed the right army. Here is a list of tonight's guesses.
<http://twitpic.com/7cmqdb>

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134506682742083584)

Also, "The Dark One's" army or "Army of the Light" does not count. The army's specific name or direct commander is needed.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (10 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134520701569871873)

I'll do some #wotgh clues for internet guessing soon. I want a few of the codes to be revealed first so you can get a feel for their theme.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/134802699391746048)

Nobody has guessed (in person to me) the army the first Viewpoint in
*A Memory of Light*
comes from. Come to my Huntington Beach signing tonight & guess.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (11 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135055513783255040)

Nobody has guessed the army of the starting viewpoint of
*A Memory of Light*
yet to win a #wotgh code. I'll post the list of guessed armies soon.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135056331727044609)

For now, I have a clue for you to try guessing a clue on-line. You might want to coordinate with Theoryland or Dragonmount on this.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135058147177013248)

Here's your clue for the internet code (different from the army one): Felix Pax. Try your guess on the Great Hunt page of my website.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135060527142551552)

As always, @terez27 has an excellent summary page up for you all. Is there a list of failed guesses somewhere?
<http://bit.ly.wotgh>

#### [ROB MOREAU](http://twitter.com/RobMoreau/status/135059779545600000)

I took a picture of the list last night, I was just about the last person through, so I think we are up to date :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135060672366116864)

Did you upload the picture anywhere for me to retweet?

#### [ROB](http://twitter.com/RobMoreau/status/135061376061280257)

List of armies:
<http://twitpic.com/7cyrd9>
and there is a list of failed attempts on the same document:

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135082321501102081)

List of wrong guesses last night for the #wotgh code. This one must be guessed in person.
<http://twitpic.com/7d5uu6>

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135425606623039488)

The army clue for #wotgh has been guessed! I won't post it here; some don't like spoilers. It should be on Terez's page I posted yesterday.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135426153493168129)

Felix's clue has yet to be guessed, even by him. People have been close, though. A hint is this: (more)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135426906970521600)

The code, which comes from RJ's notes, uses a word that I believe was NEVER used in the series.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135441764654923777)

Many are thinking the word is "Magic." That is the right idea—but not the right word.

#### [COREY PODWINSKI](http://twitter.com/thepaperstones/status/135428372867186688)

Circus?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135442297465737217)

You are a very smart person. Now you need some more words to go with your guess. Input them on my site.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/135791352746213376)

Invalid #wotgh codes: Circus Folk; Circus Show Folk; Seanchan Circus of Blood; Southern Circus; Circus of Winds; Imperial Circus

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (13 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135806103698145280)

You are very close. It's more simple than that. Keep trying; I view this code as being 'yours.'

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135806348393852929)

Also, it has come to my attention that people might be poking fun at you because I singled you out. If it's the case, I'm sorry.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135806426764410880)

It wasn't my intention; I just thought you, in specific, would be interested in this code...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135869923116318720)

Back in the US! I hid a code in the Simply Books at MSP airport gate G15. This is behind security, so get it if you are flying through.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/135883907710193665)

MSP has signed books in both the G15 bookstore and the one on the middle of the C gates. (C12ish?) Code hidden in the G15 store.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136122477960101889)

Could the person who got code #6 and entered it tell everyone what it was?

#### [RYAN D JOHNSON](http://twitter.com/ryandjohnson/status/136139972368547840)

Was that the one at MSP? Flying through G terminal there today.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136140956973010944)

It was at G15, though someone may have grabbed it by now. There are signed books there too, though... :)

#### NETHSPACE

OK, so, give us a great hunt clue :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136146364320063488)

Ha. Okay, The one about the Aes Sedai is fairly easy to guess, I think. It even has "Aes Sedai" in it.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136146496159612929)

It also has some punctuation in it, though, of an organizational nature.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (15 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136528815726927872)

Layover in Atlanta; signed the books in the Buckhead bookstore near the center of the B Gates. I hid a code in one. This is behind security.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136535378344689664)

Just got recognized on the plane by a reader. He should have asked for a #wotgh code. Anyone grab that one in the atlanta airport yet?

#### [MIKAUS](http://twitter.com/TheMikaus/status/136539607083909120)

Book and code acquired. Glad I checked twitter before I got on the plane!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136550985815441409)

Looks like @TheMikaus got the Atlanta code. Nice work! #wotgh. I'm off to Houston, assuming this plane ever takes off...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136593472277852162)

Ha! So a guy who recognized me on the plane must have friends who follow my posts; he asked for a code after the flight to give to a pal.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136602873353080832)

For those asking, yes I gave the dude on the plane a code. How could I not?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (17 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/137301527814619136)

Off to the UK! Here's a #wotgh clue. I said a code had to do with something Aes Sedai could do. Hint: it'd be very useful in RJ's home town.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/137305105493000193)

Those sending guesses at me need to put them into the great hunt page. Warning: the wording must be exact.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (19 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/137822386920755200)

In case you missed it earlier, I'm signing in London today. Forbidden Planet at 1:00. #Wotgh is still a go, also. I have codes for the UK.

#### [EBOOKWYRM](http://twitter.com/andyangel44/status/137824000737939456)

On my way down to London now!! How do we get codes?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/137824468188938240)

I will have clues about them, and maybe have one or two in the store somewhere.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/137857845440954368)

Thanks to all who gave me Magic cards this tour! I just built a deck w/them, & have time after my London signing. Beat me for a #wotgh code.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (22 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/138911088304586752)

Okay, UK WoT fans. Time to prove yourselves. I hid a Great Hunt code in one of my books in the Waterstones Milton Keynes. Can you find it?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/138928624681226240)

Just realized that I THINK the clue I left in MK is one that has been guessed. If you find it & send me a photo, I'll email you a new code.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/139004221222694913)

Has anyone found the code I hid in Milton Keynes?

#### [MATT FELLOWS](http://twitter.com/MattFellows/status/139005310793826305)

Tempted to make the 200+ mile round trip to go find it if it's still not been claimed...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/139012935602290689)

I THINK it has been claimed, but nobody has said so for certain. Where do you live?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (23 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/139254506369204224)

Great Hunt is still going. There are codes hidden in both the UK and the states that have not been found. I still have a few to give away.

#### [SLEEPINGHOUR (6 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/sleepinghour/status/144125721512656896)

Any chance of giving us another #wotgh clue? There are a few codes left that people seem to have gotten stuck on...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/144155475301244929)

Go ahead and tweet at Peter, my assistant, and prod him. He can give you some hints.
