# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #103](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#103)

My coworker has
*The Way of Kings*
cover for his desktop background. He's read it two times. Wants to know if WoT is worth his time.

I think it is, very much so. Tell him that the WOT is not a quick read, meant to be rushed through.

Some books are a feast to be consumed quickly and ravenously. The WoT is a long, stately dinner with many courses.

I've always liked the title of
*The Dragon Reborn.*
I think it's one of the best in the series.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41246677205647360)

This is because it is interesting to those who haven't read the WoT, but interesting to those reading it for different reasons.

Every time I see the Young Adult book EON:
*Dragoneye Reborn*
, it makes me wonder if she ever heard of Robert Jordan.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41255749959163904)

Yeah, I thought the same thing. Not to mention that "The Dragon Reborn" is actually a full-blown trademark.
