# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #88](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#88)

Stupid question: What sword was Rand wearing in
*The Gathering Storm*
? It was implied that he knew its story.

It was Justice, Hawkwing's sword. The real one—not the one ghost-Artur was wearing at Falme. ;)

And it's not a stupid question because there was some debate over it before the word was leaked
[at Dragonmount](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/forum/8-general-wheel-of-time-discussion/)
.

Many thought it was Guaire Amalasan's sword, and it may be that they were right, and that Hawkwing kept it as a trophy.

That might explain the scabbard, which we know is the original scabbard. And another Excalibur parallel in addition to
*Callandor*
.

I haven't answered that, I don't think, but fans have a couple of really solid theories.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/27541715803971584)

I like this answer. It fits with the assumption that Hawkwing kept Amalasan's sword as a trophy.

#### Footnote

Brandon
*did*
confirm that Rand's new sword was Justice in an email with his beta readers, but there was apparently a bit of controversy over the revelation so the beta reader who leaked it deleted their post and the incident gets glossed over a bit by Brandon.
