# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #68](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#68)

"He was sure he would never get another chance to see a Queen, and he hoped he would never have another to see a False Dragon"—Rand

Ha. I had in my head that Elayne picked up her swearing habit while traveling—but here she is, already speaking oaths to burn Rand's ears.

What to say of Rand falling into Elayne's garden in Chapter 40? As a youth, I rooted for Elayne and Rand quite a bit. Until I met Aviendha.

Never Rand and Min? Seemed the coolest choice to me.

I like Min, but remember, when I first read this book it was the only WoT book. In my mind it was "Egwene or Elayne?"

I loved this sequence as a young man. What could be better than the hero of the book accidentally falling into a princess's lap?

Of course, because of lighter-fare fantasy novels, I thought Elayne would join him immediately and pretty much only be Rand's love interest.

It's amusing to look at myself twenty years ago, reading
*The Eye of the World*
when no others in the series were out and trying to guess where it would go.
