How Moiraine is able to able to learn which Forsaken is in power in Tear and Illian in
*The Dragon Reborn*
?

I believe, but am not taking the time to look it up, she used means more mundane than you're probably expecting.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136145200430055424)

Meaning good use of information networks. That said, I'll give a tentative MAFO and try to remember to look it up specifically.

#### [KRISHNAN](http://twitter.com/metarus208/status/136145521554374656)

Oh , what do mundane method do you think she used? She found which Forsaken was in power quickly and spot on in
*The Dragon Reborn*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136149046342590464)

She is very smart, and she knew exactly what to look for. She knew they were coming, and what they would likely do.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/136148428731322368)

One good theory is that she just eavesdropped.

#### [KRISHNAN (19 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/metarus208/status/137817961862938624)

In #TorChat, you said that Moiraine probably eavesdropped in
*The Dragon Reborn*
to learn the Forsaken's identity; is this a theory in Theoryland?

#### [KRISHNAN](http://twitter.com/metarus208/status/137819643183239168)

I don't mean to ask whether it is a full theory (would be silly), I wanted to know whether it has been discussed in Theoryland.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/137833802587308033)

I have seen it discussed at Theoryland and Dragonmount, and @zemaille might have also written something on it.

#### [LINDA TAGLIERI](http://twitter.com/zemaille/status/137846878514589696)

Moiraine did eavesdrop. Egwene saw her listening to Rand and Asmodean in
*The Fires of Heaven*
'What can Be Learned in Dreams'.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/137852273366794240)

Agreed, it seems the most logical and straightforward explanation. We saw it in
*The Eye of the World*
last POV too.

#### Footnote

Eavesdropping would also explain why Sammael detected her presence. See Maria's commentary
