I have been thinking about the Aes Sedai First Oath on the oath road "Speak no word that is not true"...

#### [JWIEDOW](http://twitter.com/jwiedow/status/23173227543003136)

How do they get around that oath when telling others a different name; Moraine=Mistress Alys?

#### [JWIEDOW](http://twitter.com/jwiedow/status/23173424058736640)

Has anyone done a theory or a blog on the use of names and the oaths?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/23175774102093824)

They say 'you may call me Mistress Alys'. It's not a lie unless she says 'My name is...' which she doesn't.

I am trying to remember if they are all that way which is why I brought it up.

I don't know. If you really name yourself that, then you might be able to say it. Depends on internal rationalization.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

It's easy to say "I'm called Alys" because she is. You can even say "My name is Alys" if you have named yourself that.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Otherwise, a Sister could never go by a nickname, a different name than she'd chosen for herself, etc.
