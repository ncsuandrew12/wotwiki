# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #193](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#193)

Regarding the map of WoT, if a place is named, as a reader, at some point I expect that place to be written about.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 December 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146736823731884032)

Actually, I prefer there to be lots of names on my maps that are never mentioned or written about.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146736931718434816)

If every point on the map is story-related, I feel it makes the map feel contrived.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/146741703469056000)

I take that sentence of yours to mean, you don't care for RJ's map structure very much at all.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146742350251692034)

That is not what it means at all, Felix. It means only what I said. "I'm unlikely to explain places RJ didn't give backstory."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146742530871013377)

My reasoning being that he left them with little or no explanation for a reason, in order to be more realistic.

#### [FELIX PAX](http://twitter.com/TinkerPride/status/146744248807604225)

Realistic or easy for an author?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/146745319605022720)

I guess we're looking at it differently. I feel there are many places that haven't been explored or had more than a mention.

#### Footnote

Felix's comments were probably related to
[this argument](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=639#3)
. But, since it's Felix, only tangentially.
