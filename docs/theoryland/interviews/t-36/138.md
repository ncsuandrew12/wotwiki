*The Fires of Heaven*
had middle-child syndrome for me. Books 4-6 are among my favorites, but I always had trouble remembering what was in 5.

I THOUGHT I knew. I'd say "Oh, it has such and such." But I'd find that was in 4. I'd try again, and end up with something in 6.

Given the enormity of the disappearance of you know who, how is
*The Fires of Heaven*
not memorable?

It's more that books 4-6 blend together for me in many ways.

You know, Rhuidean is one of those words my mind refuses to pronounce correctly. Fifteen years of doing it one way in my head hold sway.

Everyone is asking how I pronounce Rhuidean. I always want to say "Roo-i-dee-un." Actually, much like Druidea from Spaceballs. Huh.

To note, that isn't the right way. #wotrr (Which, honestly, I always get mixed up, since I can't remember if the audiobooks are right or not.) I think it's Roo-i-deen. An HCFF out there can help. Did any of you hear RJ say it in person?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/BrandSanderson/~Feac7)

I really like Melindhra. #wotrr. Spoilers behind the link. Anyway, I like her a lot, probably more than I should. In the early years, reading the books, I was always annoyed when she died. I thought she was a great match for Mat. I DO like Tuon, of course, but remember, for those of us in the early days reading, she was still years off at this point.
