Interesting. In
*The Eye of the World*
, Rand uses Light and Power. Is it significant that he uses Light and Power again in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

Yes.

Can Rand channel Light and Power as a result of touching the Eye of the World, or does he have access to it because he is who he is?

It was the power in the Eye, so far as I know.
