WoT statistics: Egwene appears for the first time about 7% into
*The Eye of the World*
. She is the first person to fold her arms beneath her breasts.

As much as we like to talk about Robert Jordan using that phrase, I think that's the only time it appears in
*The Eye of the World*
.

Amusing that, after all they've grown, Egwene and Rand's interaction in
*The Eye of the World*
3 has many similarities to their interaction in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

Took me a moment to realize this phrase did not refer to Egwene's breasts ;) RT @BrandonSandrson: "Amusing that, after all they've grown..."

Lol. You just about killed me with laughter on that one.

It bears remembering that of the group, only Egwene left the Two Rivers for adventure. The others were forced. (Or felt they were.)

This is very important for her character. In a way, she was the only one who chose this life intentionally. At least at first.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/22867240311332864)

Aha. First braid tug I spotted was at the 30% mark.

I wonder if Rand and Egwene dancing in Baerlon counts as a fulfillment of her Winternight promise to dance with him on Bel Tine.

I'll admit, the Tinker scenes had me wishing—as a youth—for a Perrin+Egwene hook up. I never wanted her for Rand.

"I'd like being your Warder." Rand to Egwene, near the end of
*The Eye of the World*
.
