# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#64)

#### [Luckers (10 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24292057002545152)

I wonder if Whitebridge is made of spinglass. Does anyone have an answer?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24298473574637568)

I always took 'spinglass' to be a WoT way of saying 'spun glass'. Very fragile. Also...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24298633943846912)

'The man opened his mouth to protest as citizens always did; they seemed to think Aiel were made of spinglass'.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24298972432564225)

Obviously fragile is what he's getting at. Now, if you could do it like
*cuendillar*
...that's different.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24299226502537217)

Per Moghedien I get the impression there are many forms of
*cuendillar*
. Maybe iron is easiest.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24310117549744128)

That's a good point—I missed the spinglass = fragile reference. As for
*cuendillar*
... perhaps.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24310319874576384)

There is an argument in the same vein towards
*Callandor*
being
*cuendillar*
.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24314982837522432)

Well, people argued
*Callandor=cuendillar*
because it stopped balefire. But if Perrin can do it... :)

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24323792264237056)

There was also Osan'gar's comment during the cleansing that though the Choedan Kal would be destroyed...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24323971260354561)

... he'd still have
*Callandor*
. Of course he could have meant to balefire Rand and attack Narishma. Still, weird.

#### [KRIT PETTY](http://twitter.com/bgrishinko/status/24325508221112320)

*Callandor*
is the most powerful
*sa'angreal*
without the Choedan Kal. He might just be noting the fact.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24332006393389056)

It's the expectation that he would have
*Callandor*
after he balefired the hill which is significant.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24334009077075968)

He didn't say he was going to balefire the whole hill. Elza got his hill, though. ;)

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24334202614841345)

Strongest Rand could manage with fat man was man-thick. He could sweep it, but it's not necessary.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24355457934036992)

I did make that point, but it's weird, risking Narishma's response to the attack.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24355734439333888)

Rand was distracted, why not kill Narishma first, then Rand. Also Osan'gar links the balefire to...

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24356555981856768)

... Rand's death—"But still, he could take
*Callandor*
after al'Thor was dead."—as if it's a result.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24360030266462209)

I read it as him seeing Rand as the only real threat.

#### [LUCKERS](http://twitter.com/WoTLuckers/status/24361989140652032)

Which is weird, in itself.
*Callandor*
circle responding to reversed webs—a scary, and impossible thing for someone from the Age of Legends.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24364549197008896)

True, but he might have figured out the
*ter'angreal*
thing like Demandred, and he was at point blank range (for balefire).

#### [RUTH HINCKLEY](http://twitter.com/Lironah/status/24302873017851904)

So if the
*cuendillar*
Egwene makes is white, why are the seals half black?
*Saidin*
-made? Different type of
*cuendillar*
?

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/24528171059650560)

re: black/white, I always figured this was why Elayne couldn't get the colors right with the stone ring (no man).

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/24526932200656896)

@WoTLuckers @Lironah @Terez27 Now that's an interesting conversation. Re:
*cuendillar*
.

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/Terez27/status/25018316678504450)

lol, now I get to catalog the whole conversation because Brandon said it was interesting.
