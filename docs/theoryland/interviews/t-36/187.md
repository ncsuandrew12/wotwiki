You're known for your inventive magic systems—how was it using RJ's in WoT, which is a more traditional system?

RJ's system was very rule-based and innovative for its time. It is part of what inspired me to do the systems I do.

I've enjoyed it, though you will see me 'brandonizing' a few little things, like the usage of gateways.
