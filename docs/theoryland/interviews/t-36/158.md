# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #158](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#158)

#### [Terez (17 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/Terez27/status/103699472864903168)

Regarding my
[first question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#13)
on Gawyn (near the top), would you still answer it the same way, knowing...

#### [TEREZ](http://twitter.com/#!/Terez27/status/103699664632684544)

...the dream predicted Gawyn's death rather than Egwene's? (You didn't let me finish telling you the dream. :p)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (17 August 2011)](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/103704677715161088)

Hm... I'm going to have to look back at that dream again. Got a page number for me?

I have hardbacks (
*A Crown of Swords*
10, pp 201-2), but @e\_wot might be more helpful (CTRL-F 'marry')

I realized the wording wasn't very clear on @e\_wot. Here's the full quote:

> In the way of dreams she floated above a long, straight road across a grassy plain, looking down upon a man riding a black stallion. Gawyn. Then she was standing in the road in front of him, and he reined in. Not because he saw her, this time, but the road that had been straight now forked right where she stood, running over tall hills so no one could see what lay beyond. She knew, though. Down one fork was his violent death, down the other, a long life and a death in bed. On one path, he would marry her, on the other, not. She knew what lay ahead, but not which way led to which. Suddenly he did see her, or seemed to, and smiled, and turned his horse along one of the forks... And she was in another dream.

#### FOOTNOTE—TEREZ

Brandon never responded (not that I expected him to), but it would not surprise me if he just didn't remember that dream correctly. And therefore, his original answer about the Egwene dream doesn't necessarily mean that the prophecy is fulfilled because he believed it referred to Egwene's possible death.
