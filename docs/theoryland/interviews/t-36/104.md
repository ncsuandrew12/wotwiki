Has it been tough to make outline so far for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (25 February 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41274447990226944)

Yes, and no. The toughest part is making certain everything is in the right place.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/41275611402080256)

That's understandable. One more quick question for now. Will there be any big twists in
*A Memory of Light*
that will surprise people?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/41278607414394880)

Surprising Wheel of Time Hard Core Fans is...well, it's hard to decide what will surprise them. But there WILL be twists.
