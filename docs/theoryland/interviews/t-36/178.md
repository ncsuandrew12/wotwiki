Did the ending of
*A Memory of Light*
surprise you? As a reader and lover of the series and world, was it fully satisfying?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136149768098426880)

I will say I found it more satisfying than surprising. There are shocking elements, but I'd read so many theories... (more)

That it was hard to be completely surprised by anything. (Even if some elements, like Verin, did surprise me.)
