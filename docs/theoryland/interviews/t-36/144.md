Something fun for the #wotrr: Watch Fain. Many of you know this, but it wasn't something I saw until I started reading about the WoT.

Where Fain goes, people start getting paranoid, and you can trace his taint on individuals through the books by how paranoid they get.

Do you mean people in immediate contact with Fain like Elaida or even people in the same town?

I'm mostly talking about Elaida and others who came in direct contact in this case.
