Nynaeve knitting in Fal Dara is just not her. All later books are on how she can't sew and yet...

...in
*The Great Hunt*
she knits. Is there any explanation in RJ's notes as to why?

There might be an explanation for that, but it would be buried so deeply that...yeah. I'll let you know if I happen across it.

Remember, though, there are three million words worth of notes.
