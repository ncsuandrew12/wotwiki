I'm at the end of my WoT reread and was curious...did you add any plot elements in
*The Gathering Storm*
or
*Towers of Midnight*
, or is it all from RJ's notes?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (26 July 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95987204836442113)

There is some I had to add. In
*The Gathering Storm*
, Egwene is more RJ and Rand is more me. In
*Towers of Midnight*
, Perrin me, Mat RJ.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/95987307156480001)

But in all cases, there's a lot of RJ in everything and some of me in everything too. It's not clear-cut.
