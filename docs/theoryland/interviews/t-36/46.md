# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #46](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#46)

First non-Rand viewpoint is Perrin, at about the 38% mark. RJ's juggling of viewpoints is something I didn't see until I was older.

Many a new fantasy writer, fresh off a WoT book, plans and plots a huge epic with twenty viewpoints. That can be overwhelming to start.

Both WoT and GRRM ease into it more than you realize. In most cases, it's better to build to complexity.

I'd forgotten that Perrin nearly decides to drop his axe in the water as he swims. But he keeps it, almost against logic.

Are there actually clues in WoT that you did not find so far? That's cool.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23139015561576448)

I always find new things when I reread.

Good suggestion: @Terez27 says if you have a WoT question, and want to see if it's been asked before, you can direct it to her first.

Skipped your tweets when you warned against spoilers; are you on a #wotrr binge at the moment? Can I read without worry?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23142989849165824)

For the next four months, I'll be doing the reread. Spoilers will be present, but hopefully vague enough to not ruin things.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/23143054827327488)

But I'll be posting about the reread almost every day.
