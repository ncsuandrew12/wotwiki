Will we ever meet Elend and Vin again? Will we see more prequels/off-spins to WoT? Do you plan a trip to Slovakia?

Elend and Vin have had their stories told. WoT spin-offs are unlikely. (Sorry.) I'd love to visit Slovakia.

I'm actually reading a book about Slovakia right now, written by a friend who lived there. (It's called Vodnik.)
