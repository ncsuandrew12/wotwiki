# [Interview #36: Twitter 2011 (WoT), Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#10)

Reading this book, I'm reminded of how deeply Dragonsteel (one of my foundational, yet, unpublished works) was influenced by the WoT's start.

Actually, of the three fantasy epics I wrote during my early years—
*Dragonsteel, Elantris*
, &
*White Sand*
—
*Elantris*
was the least WoT-like.

*Elantris*
in a way reminded me of King's
*Eyes of the Dragon*
, with the fairy-tale-like writing style.

I love
*Eyes of the Dragon*
. Might be an unconscious influence.
