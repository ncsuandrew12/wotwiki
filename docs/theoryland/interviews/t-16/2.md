# [Interview #16: Letter to R. S. Cerveny, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=16#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you very much for your letter. Receiving it was like getting a great pat on the back.

I have recently become aware of Internet, and have been a little dazed by the depth of interest Internet users display in my books. It's very flattering. However, I must correct the comment about Chapel Hill: I have never attended Chapel Hill in any way and I was not a geography major (sorry) .
. I attended The Citadel, and took my B.S. there, with a double major in math and physics.

Praise from a geographer for my world-building is praise indeed! Thanks for your kind words.
