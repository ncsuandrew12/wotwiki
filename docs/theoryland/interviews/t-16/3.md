# [Interview #16: Letter to R. S. Cerveny, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=16#3)

#### Robert Jordan

I am not overly fond of the covers myself. My editor and I have fought long and hard to try to make them right, and on those occasions when we were able to speak directly to Darryl Sweet (the cover artist) most problems were taken care of in short order. On other occasions, though, when we had to go through other people at Tor, seemingly endless descriptions of people, clothes, weapons, Trollocs, etc. produced either nothing like what I envisioned or else something only close.
