# [Interview #152: COT Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=152#2)

#### Question

How did you know when you’d done enough world building to start? When did you decide it was a fully realized world?

#### Robert Jordan

I’ve never thought that. I’m still coming up with things as I go. As for when to start—flip a coin. I read a book on the history of salt. Because of a particular purpose, I thought it would be useful. Also, I used a good number of articles downloaded off the net. Historical uses, production of salt, every scrap I could find, and in the end I used about six words of it. I didn’t need it, I had it in my head. I could have brought the story to a salt-producing town, and I wouldn’t have had to go into many details, and you still would have known it was a salt town.
