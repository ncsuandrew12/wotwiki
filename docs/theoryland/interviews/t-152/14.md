# [Interview #152: COT Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=152#14)

#### Question

In The Dragon Reborn, how did the other sisters find Moraine in the Mountains of Mist?

#### Robert Jordan

Sheâ€™d been putting out feelers. All she had to do in this case was make the first contact herself with an agent of her Ajah, and word would begin to spread. Things are already winding down, so she became a focal point. You might say that the communication networks realigned themselves.

#### Footnote

The question was incorrectly transcribed, it should read as "eyes and ears", not "sisters."
