# [Interview #152: COT Signing Report - Ted Herman, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=152#15)

#### Question

I thought that maybe Min’s viewings had some relation to them. RJ describes the Finn as looking, not at Mat, but at the air around Mat’s head. I thought this was similar to the way Min sees her viewings. Are they related?

#### Robert Jordan

No.
