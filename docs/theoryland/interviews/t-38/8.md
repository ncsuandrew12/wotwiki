# [Interview #38, Entry #8]: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#8)

#### Question

What about Warders? I thought the previous glossaries (up to
*The Fires of Heaven*
) said that Aes Sedai
*couldn't*
sense the direction of their Warders?

#### Robert Jordan

The link goes both ways. Aes Sedai CAN sense the direction (and, roughly, with some practice) the distance of their Warders. Those earlier glossary entries were an error carried over from a very early version of the glossary. If you read carefully, you will notice references in the earlier books to Aes Sedai sensing the direction of their Warders.

#### Tony Zbaraschuk

[Anyone got a hint as to where those references are??]

[One of the other people at the signing mentioned the 'bonds' that Moiraine tied to Rand, Perrin, and Mat early in
*The Eye of the World*
. Those were directional, and I speculated that maybe they were related, in a very small way, to the Warder bond.]
