# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#4)

#### Question

Speaking of the Breaking, how did Dragonmount survive all that rearrangement of geography?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, the Breaking had different effects in different areas. Some areas were raised up, others lowered, others moved around... but the effects were relatively mild in some areas; Dragonmount was one of them.

Note that Shayol Ghul used to be a subtropical island. The Tar Valon area was moved, but as an entire piece, so the mountain, the island, and the river stayed in the same places relative to each other.

#### Tony Zbaraschuk

[Which I suppose makes sense, since nobody lived in the area (of Dragonmount), the men would likely have been elsewhere.]
