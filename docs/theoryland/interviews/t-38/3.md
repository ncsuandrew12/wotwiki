# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#3)

#### Question

What were the female Aes Sedai doing during the Breaking? Surely they could have got together in circles of six or thirteen or whatever, cut off one man from the Source, and gone onto the next.

#### Robert Jordan

Several things. Partly, you have to find the men before you can do anything. Partly, by the time they realized what was going on, it was too late. The massive geological upheavals were only a part (and not the most important part) of the Breaking. There was also the cumulative social collapse, breakdown of transportation systems, etc.. Imagine a city like Seattle that suddenly loses ALL contact with the outside world. Also, the women were (after a point) trying to preserve what they could, not fight the men directly. Finally, in order to make someone
*stop*
doing something, you have to be able to threaten them. What can you threaten a madman with, that he will listen to you and stop?
