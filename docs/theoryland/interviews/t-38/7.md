# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#7)

#### Robert Jordan

Speaking of the Net, Jordan did say (as noted before) that he'd read the FAQ, and was both impressed and amused by it. We got a lot of stuff right, and a lot of stuff wrong. We also have based a lot of discussion on "facts" we deduced that were actually wrong.

He DID say that he had done some things in response to net.speculations. First, if we seemed to be getting too close to something he had intended to stay hidden for a while longer, he would tone it done in later books. And if we seemed to be going off on an incredible tangent (the "How could they think THAT?" sort of thing) he would correct it. In both cases, however, he only did this if it could be fitted unobtrusively into the book.

Naturally, he refused to provide specifics. I asked if the linking discussion on the Net had led to the glossary entry in
*Lord of Chaos*
(which discussed linking in some depth). He said no, the info about linking has been in his notes all along, but he had to cut it out of previous glossaries in order to save space.

#### Tony Zbaraschuk

[I was discussing Moghedien's nature at this point, as an example of how wrong some of our deductions were [specifically mine about Moghedien's exact identity and the nature of her companionsâ€”see the FAQ, and compare with the Salidar sections in
*Lord of Chaos*
] and said that it was almost impossible to get a straight answer (or any info) out of Moghedien, and Harriet Jordan said that that was a lot like her husband; it was very hard to get info out of him.]
