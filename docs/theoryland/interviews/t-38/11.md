# [Interview #38, Entry #11]: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#11)

#### Question

What about Gawyn?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, all the information he can find indicates that his mother's dead. (First the rumor, then it apparently got confirmed when he reached Cairhien.) Rand probably killed her. His sister is missing, maybe dead. Rand's involved again. He released the woman responsible for finding Rand because he loved Egwene. Egwene is tied up with Rand, who killed his mother and is probably responsible for his sister's disappearance. Why do you think he's under any stress?

#### Tony Zbaraschuk

[Even Rand thinks that Morgase is dead.]
