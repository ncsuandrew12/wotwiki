# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#6)

#### Question

Can Thom Merrilin channel?

#### Robert Jordan

Absolutely not. I never intended anyone to think he could.

#### TONY ZBARASCHUK

Jordan also strongly implied that Thom was not Elayne's father. Oh, well, so much for all our beautiful net.theories based on those two facts.
