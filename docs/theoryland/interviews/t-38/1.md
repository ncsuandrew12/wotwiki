# [Interview #38, Entry #1]: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#1)

#### Tony Zbaraschuk

Well, here's the Seattle signing report from the University of Washington bookstore. We had quite a lot of people (probably somewhere around 130-140, according to one of the UW reps there; he didn't think it was quite 150).

Jordan was quite friendly and accessible, even on the factory line of signatures. I met several other net.inhabitants, and told one guy (who hadn't heard about it) about rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan; he said he'd log on immediately he got home that night.

I got a number of questions answered, and heard the answers to many more. Herewith the digest. (There ARE some
*Lord of Chaos*
spoilers below.)

Last chance to back out!

OK, the straight scoop. At least, as straight a scoop as could be gotten. Following "answer" text is my paraphrase of Jordan comments. (I didn't have a tape recorder,
*sob*
.)
