# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#10)

#### Question

How many more WoT books will there be?

#### Robert Jordan

Several. Some. A few. I'm not even speculating now on how many books I hope it will take, because every time I do mention a number I hope I can finish it in, it turns out to take longer. It will be at least eight, because I've signed the contracts for books seven and eight.

#### Tony Zbaraschuk

[I got the strong impression that Jordan is NOT padding anything; the WoT just keeps growing by leaps and bounds.]
