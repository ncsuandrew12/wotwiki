# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#14)

#### Question

Which of the three (Elayne, Min, Aviendha) do you like best? I'm not asking which one Rand is going to get; which one is your favorite?

#### Robert Jordan

All my female characters are based on my wife. Am I supposed to dislike something about her?
