# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#12)

#### Question

Can the Power really be used to make you different? [This arose as part of a discussion of Illusion ("Mirror of Mists" is an old name for the same thing).]

#### Robert Jordan

Illusion is illusion. Doesn't fool the sense of touch, so you have to be really subtle (such as Moghedien's disguise) to avoid detection.

#### Question

So Sammael couldn't make himself taller?

#### Robert Jordan

He could make himself look taller, but he's not interested in looking taller. He wants to be taller. Besides, any sufficiently experienced man would be able to tell that it was illusion.

#### Question

So the Power really isn't capable of genetic reconstruction? (Like, for example, making you taller.)

#### Robert Jordan

Maybe, in the Age of Legends, someone might have been able to pull it off, if they were really skilled. Might have.

#### Question

Like Aginor? He seemed to be the expert among the Forsaken on that.

#### Robert Jordan

Aginor was d\*\*n good, but he wasn't that good.
