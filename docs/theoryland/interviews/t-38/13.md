# [Interview #38: LOC Signing Report - Tony Zbaraschuk, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=38#13)

#### Question

What about your characters? Are there any of them you don't like?

#### Robert Jordan

You have to like a character to get inside of them, to make them real to the reader. Ever read a book where several characters felt right, and one of them was just wrong, where your reaction is "That can't be a real person?" If so, odds are that the writer didn't like that character. I get into each of my characters. For instance, I'm really a mean SOB when I'm writing Semirhage.
