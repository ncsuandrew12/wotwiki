#### Brandon Sanderson

Shawn Speakman has put together a great anthology coming out in early 2013 that features a bunch of big names in the fantasy field (including Terry Brooks, Pat Rothfuss, Tad Williams,
[and others](http://grimoakpress.com/2012/08/unfettered-edited-by-shawn-speakman/)
). He asked the authors to record videos to promote it, so here's
[my video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtHQbOMiD-k)
explaining my contribution.

If you're interested, you can preorder
*Unfettered*
[here](http://grimoakpress.com/2012/08/unfettered-edited-by-shawn-speakman/)
. It will also be available for Kindle and Nook once the book is released.
