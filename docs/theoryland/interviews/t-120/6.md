# [Interview #120: WH Signing Report - Hawk, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=120#6)

#### Question

There were a lot of fans upset at your decision to sell the Prologue to S&S as an ebook, and there were other people upset at your "special introduction", thinking that you were mocking your fans. What was your intent/how did this come about?

#### Robert Jordan

People who got upset about the "special introduction" need to "take a break and get a milkshake." The introduction was definitely about mocking ebooks and how it really did feel like selling your soul. S&S came to him and begged for something—anything—to sell from
*Winter's Heart*
as an ebook. He didn't go to them at all.

#### Question

Do you think you'll ever put the books out in electronic format?

#### Robert Jordan

When there's a reader that he can "drop in the water, dry with a hair dryer, and then read" he'll move over to ebooks. He's also waiting for the industry to hash out its standards. He expects that to take another 5 years or so.
