#### Question

Have you ever seen "Army of Darkness"? There's a scene in there where Ash (the protagonist) smashes the mirror and mini dopplegangers come out of each shard.

#### Robert Jordan

No. When did the movie come out?

#### Footnote

*Army of Darkness*
was released
[on October 9, 1992](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/releaseinfo)
...and
*The Shadow Rising*
was released on September 15, 1992. Looks like both parties are innocent (not that most fans of WoT would have minded if RJ had referenced the movie).
