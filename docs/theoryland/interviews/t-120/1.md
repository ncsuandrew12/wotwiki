# [Interview #120: WH Signing Report - Hawk, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=120#1)

#### Hawk

Originally I was going to skip this signing since I (A) didn't finish the book until Monday and (B) have been to so many of these before but Batya wouldn't stop bothering me until I agreed to go.

While I was one of those near the back of the line (though not quite out the door), I had a surprising amount of fun. At the store I managed to bump into someone I know, have some fun debates with the people in line around me, was introduced to a Discovery Zone book about Dungeons and Torture for kids, discover that RJ
*still*
remembers who I am, and was able to hang around and listen to RJ speak. Since only one of us in my group had finished
*Winter's Heart*
, there were very few questions asked about that book.
