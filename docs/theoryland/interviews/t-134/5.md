# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#5)

#### Question

A question followed for Jordan, asking if he considered WoT his masterpiece.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan stated that the interviewers had misinterpreted what Terry said about masterpiece, because the definition of masterpiece was not the most magnificent work. The masterpiece is the proof that you have the skills to work alone, and he considered his first novel to be that.

The role of the editor is the first set of eyes, to tell you what you are too close to the book to see. The person who tells you that yes, you made a beautiful leg, and yes the it is perfectly, but you're ignoring the fact that it's longer than the other three legs on the table.
