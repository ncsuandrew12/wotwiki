# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#13)

#### Aan'allein

We could only have one book signed, so I went for "New Spring" in
*Legends*
, then I moved sideways to Pratchett. I really like how he signed his story "The Sea and Little Fishes" in
*Legends*
:

"The big sea does not care which way the little fishes swim..."

Obviously a play on how hard it would be to leave the mass of people behind me. Still, cutting sideways I managed to get out, shortly afterwards being joined by KuraFire and Iwitness. KuraFire and I had probably already missed the bus back, so we had a long time to idle away, talking about anything and everything and seeing the mass of people continuing to stay huge. Some 30 minutes later there were only some 30 people left who wanted books signed by Pratchett, and hardly any for Jordan (unbelievable enough there were actually more Pratchett fans there), so we got back in line again to have a second book signed. (And my first one personalized.)
