# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#1)

#### Aan'allein

Anyway, Jordan arrived, telling us that he wanted to make an announcement. We'd come for Jordan and Pratchett, so there he was. He was both people, had a split personality and all. I'm sorry, I'm incapable of bringing it across as well as Jordan did, but it was funny, especially knowing all the rumors about Jordan being either George R.R. Martin, or Pratchett, or Goodkind, or any of the other bearded fantasy writers.

Then Pratchett arrived, wearing Jordan's hat.

The interviewers were the Dutch translators of the Wheel of Time, and no matter what I think about their translations, they at least know about WoT. (In fact, the Dutch translators are the only translators ever to have sent Jordan mail asking him questions.)
