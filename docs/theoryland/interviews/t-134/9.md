# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#9)

#### Question

If one character from Pratchett's and Jordan's worlds could come to this one, who would they like it to be?

#### Robert Jordan

The most interesting characters I write about are the ones you really don't want to meet. This is like the "what one thing would you change about the world?" that would lead to far too many unforseen consequences. So I'd say, "thank you very much, I'm going fishing that day".

#### Terry Pratchett

[lots of talk], eventually he'd really like to see Death when he was 150, because he is such a nice chap and would say to him it's been fun, hasn't it.
