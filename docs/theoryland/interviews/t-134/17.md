# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#17)

#### Isabel

Here below a small report from I believe someone from Dromen and Demonen. Sorry I forgot who wrote it. :(

Anyway, for people who cannot read Dutch:

During the signing a man wanted to sign his books for his daughter. RJ asked her name and he said Emma. RJ looked at him and ask how old she was. The proud father said two months and explained that it would be a while before she read the books.

Jordan knew enough and said: Oh, that's someone else. See, there was this girl called Isabel the other day, and she claims she's 17 but I think she's only 12. She's going to show me her passport tomorrow. She nearly fainted...

(I didn't faint. :) )

Quite funny to hear this.
