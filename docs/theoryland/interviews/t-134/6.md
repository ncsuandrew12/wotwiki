# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#6)

#### Aan'allein

Oh, Rando, I'm really sorry about this, but Jordan overthrew your
*toh*
-toes argument.

Pratchett was talking about you having to take care in fantasy not to use words like 'sandwich', unless you had the sandwich guy appear in your story.

Jordan disagreed: the writer is simply translating... And their word for a bit of unidentifiable meat wrapped in between some...two slices of greasy bread would translate as 'sandwich.' But that's not what they call it at all, that's just what you call it in English.

#### Footnote

Rando is presumably referring to Min's lame joke to Aviendha about 'toes' in
*Winter's Heart*
, 'A Lily in Winter'. His argument probably still holds, as it's something that shouldn't translate outside of an amazing coincidence.
