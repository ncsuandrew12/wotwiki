# [Interview #134: Rotterdam Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=134#4)

#### Question

Pratchett was asked about words, sentences, playing with them, being a carpenter of words, etc.

#### Robert Jordan

I'll take a nap while he answers that. [laughter]

#### Terry Pratchett

Well, I'll try to give a thorough and witty answer, but first I want to continue a bit about what Robert said... and he talked about us being in an Alzheimer's age, not remembering our history, and how much history he used in his books, how rarely he had to make things up.

#### Aan'allein

Then he went on to say that he did indeed not see himself as an artist with words, but preferred to think of himself as a craftsman instead of a carpenter. He talked a bit about his training as a journalist, and about medieval guilds and masterpieces.
