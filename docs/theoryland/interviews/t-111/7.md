# [Interview #111: Brisbane Signing Report - Joel Gilmore, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=111#7)

#### Joel Gilmore

I forgot to ask about Rahvin, Rand and the fish, but I'm seeing him again tomorrow :) so I'll ask him then.

We stayed right till the end, and left with him, going down in the lift together and everything. I found him a really nice guy, and very friendly.
