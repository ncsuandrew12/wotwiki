#### Joel Gilmore

Well, that's it for now. I'm off to bed, ready to see him tomorrow.

I'm going to try and get him to pronounce the names of the Forsaken (I got corrected on my Ishamael pronunciation!) and record them on the tape. Maybe a few other character names or things as well.

All right, good night all. I'll have a full transcript up as soon as I can.

Cheers, Joel.
