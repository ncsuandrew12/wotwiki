# [Interview #111: Brisbane Signing Report - Joel Gilmore, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=111#1)

#### Joel Gilmore

Ok, it's almost midnight, and I've got to get up in about 6 hours, so I'll keep this really short. Skip the next two paragraphs if you just want the questions.

Only one other person from the newsgroup was there, namely Willum, which I managed to recognise, and we got together with one of my other friends for a small Darkfriend Social afterwards. Anyway...

I did take a tape recorder, and taped the talk, though I didn't ask permission. And contrary to what I thought listening to it after we left (what you heard Willum) the tape is pretty good quality. He read the first bit of Book 8 (about the Ages come to pass and the wind etc) and that came out very well.

Ok, now the really important bit: the questions!!!
