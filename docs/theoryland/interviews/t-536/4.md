# [Interview #536, Entry #4]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Guest Blogging, Babel Clash, Interviews, Authorpalooza Tomorrow, and TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT Tour](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=536#4)

And if you look at that events page you'll notice that the book tour for
*Towers of Midnight*
has been arranged, and Harriet McDougal will be accompanying Brandon in every city this time around. It's going to be a shorter tour; Brandon has spent over half a month on tour already and needs a bit of a break. He does plan a much longer tour when
*A Memory of Light*
comes out; Brandon has some ideas about how to make that the best tour ever for the fans. But that's a long way off; Brandon still has to write the book! In any case, for those who will ask, yes, there will be a "Storm Leader"-type program for the
*Towers*
tour; keep your eyes peeled on Dragonmount for details on the Tower Guards program.
