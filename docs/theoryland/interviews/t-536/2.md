# [Interview #536: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Guest Blogging, Babel Clash, Interviews, Authorpalooza Tomorrow, and TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT Tour, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=536#2)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Three different interviews mostly about
*The Way of Kings*
have gone up recently, from seven prominent review bloggers who pooled questions in three separate groups and submitted them to Tor. I asked Brandon these questions right before his tour started, and his recorded answers took eighty minutes of audio. So they're pretty detailed and interesting. Check all of them out.
