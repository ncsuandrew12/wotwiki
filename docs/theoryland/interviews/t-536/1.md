# [Interview #536: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Guest Blogging, Babel Clash, Interviews, Authorpalooza Tomorrow, and TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT Tour, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=536#1)

#### Peter Ahlstrom

Peter here again. Brandon is back from his tour, but he's been very active online everywhere except his own website, it seems! First up, last weekend John Scalzi's Whatever blog featured a guest post essay by Brandon entitled
[Postmodernism in Fantasy](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/09/12/postmodernism-in-fantasy-an-essay-by-brandon-sanderson/)
. For people confused about what that might cover, let me say it involves a Jewel music video. (Okay, I know that doesn't help. Just go read it.)

To follow that up, Brandon is joined by hit fantasy writer Brent Weeks over on the Babel Clash blog for this week (and I think next week too), posting back and forth at each other. Brent played off Brandon's Whatever essay and they went from there, talking about foreshadowing, deus ex machina, and other writing concepts.
