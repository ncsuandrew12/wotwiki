How did you develop the idea for the Wheel of Time saga, and where did you get the name?

#### Robert Jordan

The name comes out of Hindu mythology, where there is a belief that time is a wheel. Many older cultures believe that time is cyclic, that it repeats. In fact, I believe the best thing the ancient Greeks gave us was (the idea) that time was linear and change was possible.
