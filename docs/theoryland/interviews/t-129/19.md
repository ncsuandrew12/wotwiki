#### El-Loko

Did you have the entire storyline, bar a few details, before you even started writing Book One?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. There were a good many details I didn't have, but the story line, the major events; those were all in my head. I could have written the last scene of the last book more than 15 years ago. And what happens in that scene would not be any different from what I intend to happen now.
