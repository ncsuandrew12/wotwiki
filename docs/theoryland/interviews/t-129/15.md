I see that many of the story lines are derived (from) mythology around the world. Which culture do you draw from more?

#### Robert Jordan

I'm not certain that I draw from any one culture more than others. Many myths and legends of many different cultures are really the same story when you get to the heart of it. They are often cultural cautionary tales about how we should behave and how we should live.
