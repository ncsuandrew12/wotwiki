#### Almindhra

Do you think literary critics take you seriously as a good writer despite your writing of fantasy?

#### Robert Jordan

Some do, and some don't. That's the way it always works. But I would like to add there is a lot of fantasy out there that does not call itself fantasy. The magic realists are fantasists. (A.S) Byatt is a fantasist. A good many mainstream literary writers are fantasists. So maybe the critics won't put things down, just because they are fantasy, quite as readily as they once did.
