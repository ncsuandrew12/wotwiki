#### Vercingetorix

Why do you think everyone has a hard time figuring out who killed Asmodean? Graendal killed him.

#### Robert Jordan

I don't know why people have a hard time figuring that out. To me it seems intuitively obvious even to the most casual observer. The reason I won't tell people though is that I am enjoying watching them squirm entirely too much. It's probably bad for me.
