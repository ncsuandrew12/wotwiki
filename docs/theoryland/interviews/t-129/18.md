#### Uno

Has there been any serious discussion about making a WoT movie?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes. Not a movie as such, but a miniseries. NBC has purchased an option to do a miniseries of
*The Eye of the World*
. Most options are not exercised, however. If you want NBC to make the miniseries, write to them and say "make the miniseries of
*The Eye of the World*
."
