Robert Jordan chats about his 'Wheel of Time' series

Several years ago, when Robert Jordan wrote
*The Eye of the World*
, he had no idea that his idea for a fantasy series would grow to nine books (and counting) and that an entire cottage industry would appear, devoted to his creation: the Wheel of Time. Now, every book that comes out—the latest is
*Winter's Heart*
—is an immediate bestseller, and that sound you hear is servers whirring with the constant e-mailing and message-posting of his fans, discussing the many aspects of Jordan's creation.

Jordan recently chatted with some of his fans on CNN.com about
*Winter's Heart*
, the Wheel of Time, and the story behind the story.
