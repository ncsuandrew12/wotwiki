#### Question

Do you work off of an outline? Because the books are very detailed.

#### Robert Jordan

No, not really. I make a 'sort-of' outline at the beginning of every book. And then I sort of forget about it. [indistinct]...go away from my outline, and not follow the outline at all...[indistinct]
