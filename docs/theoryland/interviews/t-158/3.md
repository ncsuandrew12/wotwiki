#### Robert Jordan

How many more books are there going to be? [crowd laughs] Um, I am going to need at least two more books. I apologize for that. [crowd murmurs that two's not enough] When I first started this thing, I though I could do it in four or five books, maybe even six. Ive known the last scene of the last book since 1984...I could have written the last scene of the last book in 1984. It's just taken a little longer to get to it than I thought it was going to be. So at least two more booksâ€”if I can finish it in two books I will, but I ain't making no promises. [crowd laughs]
