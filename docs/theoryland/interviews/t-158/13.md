# [Interview #158: COT Signing Report - Bradley Staples, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=158#13)

#### Bradley Staples

Can you explain a bit about the properties of the World of Dreams? Such as when Nynaeve forced Moghedien to drink forkroot tea, which caused the Forsaken to fall asleep. But within that same book, the Wise Ones tell Egwene that drinking tea will in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
will cause no effects upon the body.

#### Robert Jordan

It's a strong matter of belief. If you believe something like that will happen to you, then it can and does.

#### Bradley Staples

[I wonder why Moghedien believed that though, if she one of the best of the (Forsaken) in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
]

#### Question

Also, what about wounds and pain? Causing pains/wounds though an intermediate source—such as stabbing one with a dagger made in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
—causes lasting pain. Yet if one were to simply cause the other to feel that pain directly, it fades upon reaching the waking world.

#### Robert Jordan

No it doesn't. If you feel pain in the World of Dreams, in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, then you have that pain in the waking world.
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
IS real in that respect.

#### Bradley Staples

[More along the same, I forget wording. But I wonder why pain would stay, if Egwene's healing didn't? Belief again?]
