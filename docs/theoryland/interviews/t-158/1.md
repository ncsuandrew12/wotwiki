# [Interview #158: COT Signing Report - Bradley Staples, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=158#1)

#### Bradley Staples

Some parts were indistinct on my recorder, though, so you'll see where I couldn't make it out by this: [indistinct]. At the end, I couldn't tell what he said at all, so it's only about a third of the Q&A session. Keep in mind that I there were over three hundred people at this signing (possible even over four hundred), and I was somewhere around thirty feet or so from where RJ was speaking (the second row back on his left). And I don't have the best recording equipment in the world. Anyways, here we go.
