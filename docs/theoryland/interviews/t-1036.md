## [Entry #1](./t-1036/1)

#### Question

You mention the phases of the moon fairly often in
*The Way of Kings*
â€”is this significant or something that we should be paying attention to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

After working with the Wheel of Time community and dealing a lot with fans wanting to know when certain events happened in regards to some other event, Brandon added in the phases of the moon in order to give dedicated fans a way of determining the chronology of the events of the Stormlight Archives.

#### Footnote

"Phase" is not the word Brandon used, it has more to do with which moon is up.

## [Entry #2](./t-1036/2)

#### Question

Is there a pattern to Taravangian's stupid/smart cycle, or is it actually random?

#### Brandon Sanderson

His aides are convinced that it is random, but if you plotted it out, it's really a distribution curve that is only made to look random.

## [Entry #3](./t-1036/3)

#### Question

Dalinar, in one of his visions, sees the stars wink out one by one. Are these the stars of other shardworlds and [Brandon sort of interrupted me here to answer so the rest just kind of came out as a mumble] does this imply that the final Desolation is going to affect more than just Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You earned yourself a RAFO card!
