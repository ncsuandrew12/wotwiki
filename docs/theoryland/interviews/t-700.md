## [Entry #1](./t-700/1)

#### Thorondir

Are Seons Splinters of Aona?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that that line of theorising is very close and that we are figuring it out.

## [Entry #2](./t-700/2)

#### Thorondir

Is the Dor the same as the power of creation that powers Allomancy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that the Dor is similar to that which powers allomancy but not 100% the same.

## [Entry #3](./t-700/3)

#### Thorondir

Who names the planets? You've said once that "Scadrial" was the name of the planet as Ruin and Preservation knew it, but where'd they get that name? Do the Shardholders all get together and vote on it or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said thay already had their names and that the all the planets existed before the shardholders got there.

## [Entry #4](./t-700/4)

#### Thorondir

How many Shardworlds are there? Only seven? (Sel, Nalthis, Scadrial, Roshar, Yolen, Taldain, and whatever planet The Silence Divine is on?)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he has a set number in his head but that he didn’t want to say it because he might change his mind. Essentially he doesn’t want to make the number of world’s canon yet.

## [Entry #5](./t-700/5)

#### Thorondir

Why do Shards refer to themselves by their Shard name, rather than their original name? Do they still remember their original name?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes they do, they do remember their original selves( didn’t get any more then that though).

## [Entry #6](./t-700/6)

#### Thorondir

How could a person from Scadrial access Shadesmar? An alloy of a god metal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He RAFOd me on this one and said it was a plot point for future novels.

## [Entry #7](./t-700/7)

#### Thorondir

Does Bavadin hold a Shard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes (and that’s about all he would say. He did however confirm that Rayse is Odium)
