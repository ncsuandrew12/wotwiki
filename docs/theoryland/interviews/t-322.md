## [Entry #1](./t-322/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The latest
*Warbreaker*
revision is finished. I'm glad to have this one off my plate; I hadn't realized how anxious I was getting about this book until I sat down and worked on it. It's now been a year and a half since I finished it, and I worried that I was letting it dangle, pushing it off time and time again and not giving it the attention it deserves. This is partly due to the fact that I'm not sure if it will get a sequel anytime soon.

In the past, I've said that I was planning to write the sequel. (Tentatively titled
*Nightblood*
, though I worry that's too horror-sounding.) The problem is, I now have
*A Memory of Light*
on my plate, and it is going to need a LOT of attention. The question is, do I want to have
*Warbreaker*
come out in the spring of 2009,
*A Memory of Light*
come out in the fall of 2009, then have a sequel to a two-book series be my follow-up to that?

It seems to me that I'm in a unique position. A lot of fantasy authors dream of being able to launch something BIG. An epic series which will get a powerful marketing push and a lot of attention. It seems to make far more sense to me to launch a brand new series the year after
*A Memory of Light*
, rather than putting out an ambiguous sequel which ends a two-book series.

That doesn't mean I won't write book two. It just means that I'm thinking of starting a much larger story, then slipping in the WARBREAKER sequel sometime later.

Anyway, WARBREAKER 4.0 will go up early next week. It is my goal to post the downloadable version, then actually do an html chapter-by-chapter version for ease of reading. Would anyone (who hasn't read Warbreaker yet) be interested in this? Sound off on my LJ, my Facebook, or my forums.

You can also let me know what you think I should do next. You probably won't change my mind (it's not a vote) but I'd be curious to see what readers are wanting.

Warbreaker sequel
  
Elantris sequel (Different characters, same world.)
  
Big Epic (five or six books on a new project)
  
Random Stand Alone
  
Dragonsteel (Which is written, but now I don't know when to release it.)
  
More books in the Mistborn world

(Note: Again, I wouldn't do any more with the same characters. Their story is done after book three, as I promised it would be.)
