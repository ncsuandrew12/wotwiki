# [Interview #86, Entry #3]: TPOD Signing Report - Pam Basham](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=86#3)

#### Pam Basham

Regarding the Dragon and the Dragon Reborn (and Graendal's thoughts about Ishamael's musings):

"Is this soul born in any other Age, or only at the advent and (theoretically, of course) the closing of the Third Age, as the Dragon/the Dragon Reborn?"

#### Robert Jordan

This soul is one of the Heroes, and bound to the Wheel, spun out as the Pattern wills. "It" is born in other Ages, but in a non-Dragon incarnation, to suit the pattern of that Age.

#### Pam Basham

In the course of this answer, he related this to why Hawkwing calls Rand "Lews Therin" at Falmeâ€”because Hawkwing recognizes this soul. This didn't really tell me why he specifically calls him "Lews Therin", but apparently they've been hangin' together in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
and the etiquette there is to call each other by the name of your last incarnation. (My interpretation.)
