# [Interview #86: TPOD Signing Report - Pam Basham, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=86#5)

#### Pam Basham

Still stunned, I didn't notice that the hordes behind us were breathing hard and looking like they might begin a stampede, but RJ then very politely asked us to move on.

All in all, in complete abandonment of any kind of L.A. Kewl, I was completely thrilled to meet Jim and Harriet.

Wishing everybody at the rest of the signings lots of fun and frivolity and an utter absence of RAFOs.

Thanks to everyone for the info from the other two signings.

Pam Basham
