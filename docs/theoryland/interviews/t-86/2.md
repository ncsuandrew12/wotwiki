# [Interview #86: TPOD Signing Report - Pam Basham, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=86#2)

#### Pam Basham

Regarding Cadsuane's pointed reminiscences about the good ol' days in Far Madding, I asked, "So can we assume..." and didn't even get to finish the question before he answered...

#### Robert Jordan

"Cadsuane is from Far Madding." And followed immediately, with no prompting, with "and Verin is from Far Madding." \*Arched eyebrow\*

#### Pam Basham

For some reason, this last elicited a Startled Moment from Harriet. I was determined not to get a RAFO, so I didn't pursue this any further. Also I was nervous and had more questions.
