# [Interview #655: LOC Signing Report - Scot T. May, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=655#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Interesting enough, Jordan had three bottles of Perrier and some cheese to munch on for the time he was there. And Jordan was pretty nice, though he had an intense stare. I was surprised that he wasn't cranky after all these trips. I've only gone to one other book signing, and the author there was cranky. He didn't have any cheese, though.
