#### Scot T. May

I didn't get a chance to see
[Pam's T-shirt](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=33#4)
. :( I did see John's marching circuits shirt.

And, Pam did kinda blend in, dressed in black, although there was more black leather than anything else in that neighborhood. I felt out of place in my Snoopy t-shirt and IBM haircut.

Parking wasn't too bad. I parked a couple of blocks west of the book shop and it wasn't even metered. I suppose it must be worse on weekdays.

It was good pizza at Giordano's. Much better than around here at Purdue.
