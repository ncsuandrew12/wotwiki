Any kind of Investiture to make a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not any but there are multiple methods. Some work better than others.

#### rani

Can you Forge a Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um… \*sighs\* To Forge a Shardblade, meaning make a regular sword through Forgery into a shardblade, would require so much Investiture it’s like asking if we can make lead into gold using a particle accelerator. Yes but it's horribly, horribly, horribly inefficient.
