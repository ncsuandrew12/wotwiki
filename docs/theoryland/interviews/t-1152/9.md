# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#9)

#### Question

[Note: This question was asked by a young boy sitting near the front.] So for the Stormlight Archive series–

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Stormlight Archive? How old are you? [audience laughter]

#### Question

Nine?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nine? And you’re reading the Stormlight Archive? [loud cheering]

#### Question

So the character Lift, with her powers, why does she only have to eat food instead of sucking in stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So Lift is a really weird one. She visited the Old Magic and asked something very strange, and the Old Magic didn’t know how to treat that, and so answered with something equally strange. So you will actually see what happened with Lift and things like that, but suffice it to say some really weird things are going on.
