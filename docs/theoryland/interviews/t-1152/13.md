#### Question

In the Wax and Wayne series, how do you come up with all of Wayne’s little wisecracks?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So here’s the deal. It’s kinda hard to write people who are more clever than you are. It’s one of the tricks you have to learn as a writer. The big difference, they do it off the cuff in the moment, and you can spend a week or two trying to find the perfect thing to say, and that’s really how it goes. Oftentimes the characters who are more humorous, like Wayne’s a great example. It’s very natural how he says things; it can take me weeks to come up with like a couple of lines of dialogue for Wayne, where other things get written very quickly.
My favorite Wayneisms are when I can have him use a word that looks–when you’re reading along you assume it’s a word, but then you go back and you’re like, “Wait a minute. Did he actually say defecation of character?” Or something like that. So you don’t even notice on the first read through. The things that a copy editor’s like, “You used the wrong word here,” those are my favorite Wayneisms. Those take forever.
