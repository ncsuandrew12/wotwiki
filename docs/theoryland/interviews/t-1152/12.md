# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#12)

#### Question

With all the characters that you design, and you just said how you put a character in and see if it works, are there any characters that you keep on a backlog and try to mix and see if they fit?

Totally. What I have is this notes file, literally called “Cool stuff that I need to use sometime.” And it’s like when I see something in the news or I meet a person and say, “I need to use that someday.” It can be years before I end up sticking them in. There’s a cool example of something like this that I finally managed to stick in years later. It happens all the time. I’ll try to think of it, so when you come through the line ask me and I’ll try to remember.
