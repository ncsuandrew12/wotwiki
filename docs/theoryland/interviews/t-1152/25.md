# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#25)

#### Question

We were wondering who would win in a fight, a Mistborn or a Windrunner.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would really depend on the situation. I would say the Windrunner would win on a battlefield and the Mistborn will when at sneaking around and slitting peopleâ€™s throats.
