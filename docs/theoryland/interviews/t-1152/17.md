# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#17)

#### Question

Who was your favorite Mistborn character to write? Personally I hated Elend and Vin but I loved Zane.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You hated Elend and Vin and you loved Zane… Um. I–I’d probably stay away from you. [more laughter] But who’s my favorite? Picking a favorite character is almost impossible. It’s whoever you’re writing at the moment. But I kind of have a personal connection with Sazed, so I’ll say Sazed.
