# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#22)

#### Question

With the changes that happened to all the cities in the Reckoners—like we know there was a big war in Portland—did you have anything specific that happened in Seattle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um…yes, but I don’t want to canonize any of that. I’ll save it for when I’m actually writing.
