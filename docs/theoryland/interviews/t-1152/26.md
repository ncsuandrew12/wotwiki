# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#26)

#### Question

So I just finished The Bands of Mourning, which was my favorite out of that series. Did you know when you were writing Alloy of Law how you were going to link this to the original, with the kandra, the bands of the Lord Ruler...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah the kandra were seeded, MeLaan you can go and look back in the original three. Like I’m going to use her in the next series, for sure. Now what I usually do is when I’m starting a series, and I did this for this one, is I will write the first book in the series. So I did this with Steelheart, I did this with the original Mistborn, I did this with Alloy of Law. I write the first book, I sit down, and say “Okay, what worked about that, what can I expand upon” and then I outline the series with those characters and then go back and revise the first one to match and then I release the first one. Does that make sense?

#### Question

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

So not everything do I know writing the first one but by the time I’m through the revisions I usually do.
