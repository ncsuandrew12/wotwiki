# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#55)

#### Question

Who is the Lord Ruler’s child/children?

#### Brandon Sanderson

People are searching a little too hard for this, he had several, they mixed with the population. There might be specific individuals who claim heirship and things like that but it’s not like there’s one hidden person among the population, does that make sense? Even those who claim heirship may not have any more blood than a lot of other people. I think this is one where fans have latched onto it a little too strongly and I need to let them know they can back off, there’s not a big secret for them to be hunting.
