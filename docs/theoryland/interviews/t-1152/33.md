#### Question

For all the spren, like the honorspren and the liespren, I’ve noticed that all of the characters, the honorspren have been girls and all the liespren have been boys. Is that just ‘cause all the people who attract liespren are girls and all the other people--

#### Brandon Sanderson

So it’s not a one to one ratio of people who are more likely to attract a spren of the opposite gender.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah I’ll delve into it eventually in the books. Maybe just obliquely, but there is a reason for it.
