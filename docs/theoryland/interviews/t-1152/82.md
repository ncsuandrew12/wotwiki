#### Question

What Shard is the opposite of Odium in the sense of the [board? Borg?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are several that could be considered opposite--

#### Question

I mean in the assimilation sense, you’ve said that Odium doesn’t want to absorb any of the other ones but which one would want to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, which one would want to join with him?

#### Question

Or any of them.

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*pause\* I think that \*long pause/picks up after next question\* I think that if personalities had been different, Honor and Odium, there would have been a very natural pairing, not that they’re opposites but they would have attracted.
