# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#39)

#### Question

Okay, so when Kelsier is in the-- Which Realm is he in?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s in the Cognitive Realm.

#### Question

Is he seeing people from other worlds or is he--

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he meets some people who are traveling but Cognitive Realm is location dependent. He is on the Cognitive Realm on Scadrial and the people he runs into there-- until he kind of travels off into space, which is where he finds the fortress.

#### Question

So even though he’s tied to Scadrial could he go to the Cognitive Realm of other worlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He would have trouble getting to another planet, being a Cognitive shadow like he was.

#### Question

So is there some particular thing that somebody would need to have to be able to move between the realms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A body is helpful.

#### Question

That does make sense.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Depends on what their ties are and things like that. Not always, but yeah.
