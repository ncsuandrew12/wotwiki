#### Question

Secret History was cool, thank you for that. Do you plan to have a series of that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I can squeeze them in.

#### Question

Would they primarily be in the Cognitive Realm like this one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not always, theyâ€™d just be behind the scenes stuff happening with characters who are more cosmere aware.
