# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#41)

#### Question

Did you worry with Secret History that it was a bit too meta for people who had no idea…

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that’s why all the warnings are there. It’s kind of intended for the people--

#### Question

Yeah, fair enough.

#### Brandon Sanderson

--who want something, does that make sense? Like it isn’t really-- it is a story, but it's not a real story, it’s got weird narrative and things to it. It is there for those who really want to know.

#### Question

And I’m one of those people, I just have to wonder if you had no idea you’d be really confused through at least the first half.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes you would. But that’s why all the warnings are there.
