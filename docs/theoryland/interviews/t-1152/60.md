# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#60)

#### Question

In Secret History we learned a little about how the Cognitive Realm...could bleed into the Physical if the person was slightly broken.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Broken as Kelsier’s term is not right, and he realizes that over the course of the book, but yeah.

#### Question

My thoughts were on Wayne, so he seems to notice--and it might just be kleptomania--a connection between items that makes him feel as if he’s not stealing, just trading things for equal value. And I’m wondering if he’s noticing something in the Cognitive-- in one of the other Realms that is actually noteworthy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s just goofy.
