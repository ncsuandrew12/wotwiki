#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

--is that because the Shards are sort of… My impression from the book was that the Shards were--in the Mistborn books--specifically in that area but is it because the universe is formed across all of them that that is why the metals--

#### Brandon Sanderson
