#### Question

In Bands of Mourning we saw the medallions that can give people Connection to the area that they are in. Two thoughts on that. One… if a person were to get a connection to one of the areas from Elantris would they be able to gain the powers from the area?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah that’s a good question, it’s not that easy. But it is an excellent question.

#### Question

And if there was an area where the primary language was sign language, would a person gain the ability to speak sign language to the people present by using that connection?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It is definitely related to the Cognitive Realm and how people are thinking about language.
