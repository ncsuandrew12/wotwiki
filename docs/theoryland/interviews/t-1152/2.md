#### Question

I listen to your podcast, Writing Excuses, and you’ve been this year breaking down stories into different parts. Was Bands of Mourning was your attempt to write a pulp novel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Actually, all of the Wax and Wayne books are a harkening back to classic serials of old novels. It’s interesting looking back at that. I kind of pitched those books to myself as Mistborn the television show, or the action serial. The other ones were the epic fantasy, these were the action serials, and I did try to kind of vary the genre. The first one is straight up detective novel, the second one’s a psychological thriller, and the third one is classic serial adventure story. That was very intentional. It was me trying to take different tones and mash them up with different stories and see what comes out.
