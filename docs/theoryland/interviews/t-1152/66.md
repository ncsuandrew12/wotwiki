#### Question

At the end of Hero of Ages, there’s the--I forget what it’s called, when the kandra all remove their Hemalurgic nails--and then I forget which character wakes up and just sees the blobs everywhere, and then after what everything that happens I don’t really know what happened to the kandra after that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

They returned their spikes but that left them with holes in their memory.

#### Question

Who did? The survivors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the survivors.
