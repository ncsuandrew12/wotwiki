#### Question

Have we ever seen the Physical embodiment of either Odium or Cultivation? Similar to what we saw with Ruin chasing...Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So \*pause\* physical embodiment is kind of hard thing to define with Shards because you could argue that everything is a physical embodiment of them, does that make sense?

#### Question

Yes. I mean more a physical form that the uses share--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh okay, okay. So have you ever seen Odium’s? I don’t believe you’ve seen Odium’s.

#### Question

What about Cultivation’s?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Cultivation is a RAFO.
