#### Question

Do you have any ideas for characters in different stories meeting each other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I do. You’ll see a bunch of that. And if you haven’t seen the little behind-the-scenes Mistborn novella, Secret History, which is ebook only right now. The print edition will come out in the fall. That involves characters from different stories meeting each other.
