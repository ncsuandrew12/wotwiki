# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#10)

#### Question

I wanted to say that I admire that your characters are people first, and not gender first. But I wanted to ask you, does anyone call you Branderson?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it is starting to catch on. I don’t know if it would be my first choice, but I will accept Branderson as opposed to… if people called me BS.
