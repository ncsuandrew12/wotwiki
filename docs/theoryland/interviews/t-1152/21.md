#### Question

What happened with Abraham’s court marshal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, that is backstory that is also a RAFO. Why Abraham was there is not something that he likes to talk about. It’s not that he’s shy, but at the same time it’s not something that he easily talks about, so I will not talk about it. I will let him someday, perhaps, talk about it.
