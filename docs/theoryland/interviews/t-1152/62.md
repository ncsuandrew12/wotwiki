#### Question

What happens when you Lash water, or a body of water?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Excellent question, it’s going to have some hard time gripping on--

#### Question

Would it have a gravity well going on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah it would have a gravity well, it think-- yeah. You are the first person to ask about that, I don’t think even my assistant has asked about that. So that’s your tentative answer until I think about it some more, but I think it would.
