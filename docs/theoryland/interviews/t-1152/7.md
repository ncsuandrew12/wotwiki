#### Question

With as many novels as youâ€™ve written, do you have an assistant or a system you use to remember everything?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I do. What I use is a wiki. I use a personal wiki, just like Wikipedia. I use an open-source software called wikidpad. I have someone whose job it is to read my books after I write them, go make all of those notes into the wiki with page references so I can look them all up in the book. They have a very fun yet tedious job.
