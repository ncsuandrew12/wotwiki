#### Question

When you are burning a Compounded metal are you getting the metal’s effect and the stored power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, so when you are Compounding--

#### Question

Can you explain, I’m unclear on the Compounding.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Compounding is a way to hack the magic system so you can get a Feruchemical attribute out of-- basically powering Feruchemy with Allomancy. If that makes sense.

#### Question

So you’re not actually burning the metalmind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kind of? There’s a big explanation on Reddit, if you send me an email I can link you to it, that steps you through exactly, easier than explaining it here.
