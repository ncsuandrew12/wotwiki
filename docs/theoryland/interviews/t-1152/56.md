#### Question

How is a new Feruchemist made?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What do you mean?

#### Question

Well you can make a new Mistborn by lerasium--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, okay. Other than through birth?

#### Question

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a RAFO, good question though. Right now, as far as anyone knows, it’s by birth only. But-- Well we’ll leave it there. You know that the extra Preservation instead of Ruin had some effects on people on Scadrial.
