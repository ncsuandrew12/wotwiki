#### Question

How many magic systems are in The Stormlight Archive, and how many of them [have been seen?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would see the only major one you havenâ€™t seen is Voidbinding, it depends on how you count them. I count fabrials as one, Surgebinding as one, and Voidbinding as one. And then the Old Magic is kind of its own weird thing.
