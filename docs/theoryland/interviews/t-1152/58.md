# [Interview #1152: Calamity-Seattle, Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1152#58)

#### Question

Speaking of intents, Investiture, and what Shards can see, hypothetically if Odium were to go to Scadrial would some things not be visible to him, like, say, metal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Metal would be hard for him to see, yes.
