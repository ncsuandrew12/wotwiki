# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#9)

#### Chiara Codecà

I’ve read that Red Eagle Entertainment LLC is interested in your work and has acquired the exclusive production rights to the first book of the The Wheel of Time series,
*The Eye of the World*
.

#### Robert Jordan

Red Eagle Entertainment has signed an option to create a feature film based on
*The Eye of the World*
. I hope that this will happen, but we’ll see.

#### Chiara Codecà

Will you be involved in the production?

#### Robert Jordan

To some extent. The contract I signed asked me to be a consultant but how much movie makers consult writers….well.

#### Chiara Codecà

Are you worried about what can become of your work?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, you always worry because once they get their hands on the book they can do almost anything they want with it. For all I know they could re-release Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama under the title of this book.
