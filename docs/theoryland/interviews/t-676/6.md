# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#6)

#### Chiara Codecà

I don’t mean to intrude on something that may be a personal matter to you, but I know that you served two tours of duty in Vietnam. Did that experience affect in any way your work?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it didn’t have an effect on my work. In my family going into the military was a tradition, sometime as a career, sometime just for one tour of duty. I choose the Army and because there was a war going on, I went where the war was. Simple.
