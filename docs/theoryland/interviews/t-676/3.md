# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#3)

#### Chiara Codecà

But why did you decide on fantasy literature?

#### Robert Jordan

Are you familiar with Schrödinger’s cat?

#### Chiara Codecà

I was not, but I checked when I found out that you mentioned it in another interview.

#### Robert Jordan

(Smiles) You did your homework. It’s quantum physics. It’s a theory that says that if a cat were put into a steel closed chamber filled with radiation you can’t know if the feline is dead or alive until you open the door. Until you do, because of the superposition of possible outcomes that exist simultaneously, the cat would be dead and alive at the same time.

Schrödinger's Cat is really a test in a way. If you can wrap your mind around Schrödinger's Cat and accept that, then you are ready to take on quantum physics. I also think, if you can wrap your mind around Schrödinger's Cat and accept that, than you are ready to write fantasy.
