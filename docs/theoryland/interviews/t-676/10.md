# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#10)

#### Chiara Codecà

You said before that if you can wrap up your mind about Schrödinger’s cat then you can probably write fantasy. Could this lead us to say that a creative mind doesn’t resolve itself in only one area of expertise?

#### Robert Jordan

I think that if you’re truly creative you can be so in different areas, yes. Not in all them equally, of course, but a truly creative person isn’t bound to a single area, yes.
