# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#1)

#### Chiara Codecà

You have a degree in physics and you were employed by the Navy as a nuclear engineer: why did you decide to become a writer?

#### Robert Jordan

It doesn’t seem to me such a big step, maybe because I’ve always wanted to write. When I was an engineer I got seriously injured, I had a very long convalescence in which I read a lot and I got bored with what I was reading. It was then that I said to myself that I had been waiting long enough, and if I wanted to write it was time to do it or shut up. So I did it.
