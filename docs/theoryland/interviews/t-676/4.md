# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#4)

#### Chiara Codecà

A curios reader cant’t help but notice that the Forsaken are named after fallen angels and demons from the Judeo-Christian tradition. All the Wheel of Time series is full of themes and motifs from religions and myths from different parts of the world…

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, yes. I used Arthurian legends, Chinese and Japanese mythology, Indian mythology, traditions from Latin America and Africa. Some myths from Europe, but not much of Celtic because it’s been done so much.

#### Chiara Codecà

This means you’ve read about all of these subjects?

#### Robert Jordan

I read about everything. My knowledge is this wide and much less deep. I truly like to read about a lot of things.
