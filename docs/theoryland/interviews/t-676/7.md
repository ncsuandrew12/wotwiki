# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#7)

#### Chiara Codecà

How many more books will you write for the Wheel of Time series?

#### Robert Jordan

I hope that there will be only two more books in the main sequence and then two prequels, the first prequel, New Spring, is already published. I said “I hope” because when I started out I thought it was only going to be five books, then it grew on it’s own.

#### Chiara Codecà

So when you began The Wheel of Time you knew where you where heading?

#### Robert Jordan

I know exactly where I'm heading. I've known the last scene in the last book for about 20 years.
