# [Interview #676: Fantasy Magazine Interview with Robert Jordan, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=676#8)

#### Chiara Codecà

I know that you are working on the eleventh book of the Wheel of Time series,
*Knife of Dreams*
.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, but there’s no way I’ll tell you anything else about it.

#### Chiara Codecà

Tell me something about the prequel, then,
*New Spring*
. I know it was originally a short novel you published in 1998.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, but it’s not an expansion. The novel
*New Spring*
is what I wanted to write in the first place, but I realized that Robert Silverberg would get very angry if I’d sent him a 120,000 words to put in his anthology! So I did a lot of cutting and I made it fits into the anthology, but I still had that novel waiting to be written and I wanted to write it because there was a lot to be said that really fits into the rest of the series.

Even if the prequel has only two storylines while my normal books have four or five storylines there are things that you will not see anywhere else, such as the test for Aes Sedai. You actually see someone take the test for Aes Sedai and you learn how that is done: I have no intention to ever showing it anywhere else.

Also there are clues in
*New Spring*
not only as to why certain people hate each other in the main sequence books, but why certain people die in the main sequence books, and I’m not going to put the evidence anywhere else because I’ve already given it here.

#### Chiara Codecà

That’s why you decided to publish the prequel before the end of the series?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I decided to published
*New Spring*
before going on because my publisher asked me to do it, but in retrospect that was probably a mistake. I shouldn’t have. It won’t happen again, though, I’ll work on the next two prequels only after I’ve finished the main sequence books.

#### Chiara Codecà

And then what will you do? Do you already have another series planned?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, a much more compacted sequence of books. Set in a different universe, different world, different rules and different cultures. Nothing that will be reminiscent of
*The Eye of the World*
or The Wheel of Time at all.
