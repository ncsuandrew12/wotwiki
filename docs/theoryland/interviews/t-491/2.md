# [Interview #491: TGS Signing Report - wolfbro22, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=491#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I asked if the pacing would be the same in
*Towers of Midnight*
as it was in
*The Gathering Storm*
and he said that
*The Gathering Storm*
was like books 1-3 and
*Towers of Midnight*
would be like 4-6. I'm not sure if this is new or not but thought I'd post it.
