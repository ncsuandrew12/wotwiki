# [Interview #1184: Reddit: If you had a make-a-wish and for some reason chose Brandon Sanderson to answer one question, what would your question be?, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1184#6)

In
*Eye of the World*
, Min sees Perrin standing amongst flowering trees. It's meaning is unknown, but I personally thought it meant he'd help the Tuatha'an find their song. No evidence to the effect, though. As far as I know, it was never definitively settled, but what did it mean? Did RJ leave any notes to that effect?

This image is not about the song, unfortunately. I believe it is, as has been stated, about his family.

The notes do say explicitly that the Tinkers do not find their song.

That fact makes me pretty sad. I was holding out hope that they'd found it, or at least part of it.

Here's what RJ said—though I can't remember if this is in interviews or if I got this via Harriet.

The song is not something that can be found. Over the years, the "Song" has come to mean something to the Tinkers—it means peace, harmony, everyone getting along. Perhaps even a little touch of Nirvana.

Even if they heard the song, as it originally was, they would not accept it as "The Song." Rand actually knows the song—and everyone who has been through the pillars hears it, I believe. But this is not "The Song."

As long as there is strife in the world, The Song has not been found.
