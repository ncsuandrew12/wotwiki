# [Interview #1184: Reddit: If you had a make-a-wish and for some reason chose Brandon Sanderson to answer one question, what would your question be?, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1184#7)

Nakomi for sure. Drives me mad we'll never know...

I do know about Nakomi. However, I must honor what I believe to be RJ's wishes in regards to this. Perhaps some day.

I'm more able, ironically, to speak about the pipe—as I don't know the answer, and can theorize like a fan upon its meaning.

There are at least two other things about the ending that people have never asked me, which I expected them to, which involve deep secrets about the series and its conclusion. One is minor, but interesting. The other I consider major. So perhaps someone will someday tease those out of me.

Interesting about the other points given how thoroughly we've dissected the book over the past couple of years. Now I'm intrigued!

I'm not saying they haven't been dissected—I don't follow HCFF discussions these days as I once did—but I do know I haven't been asked about these things that I remember. (At least, not in a specific enough way.)

Yeah, that is some Jordan-level trolling there, Brandon. Well done.

E: I mean trolling in the
*nicest way possible*
, of course

:) I've found that the fandom does enjoy me giving little nudges here and there.

So even if it was a make-a-wish, you still would not tell that person about Nakomi?

Edit: I should mention that that I'm asking as an extremely hypothetical situation.

In that hypothetical, I would ask Harriet if it's okay, then do it if she agrees that I can.
