# [Interview #629: Amazon.com Author One-on-One: Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=629#18)

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's been great talking to you again, Pat. Will I see you at Worldcon in Reno this August? We're going to record some episodes of the
[Writing Excuses podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
there, and we'd love to have you on as a guest again.

#### Patrick Rothfuss

I'll be there. And I'd love to do another Writing Excuses. I had a ton of fun with the first one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks, Pat. It's been fun. I'm looking forward to posting my review of
*Wise Man's Fear*
when the book comes out.
