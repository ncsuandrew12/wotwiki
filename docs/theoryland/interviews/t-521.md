## [Entry #1](./t-521/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the most recent Writing Excuses podcast episode, Dan and I are joined once more by James Dashner and Julie Wright to talk about
["mating plumage": book covers, titles, and first lines](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/06/27/)
. Again, this episode was recorded at CONduit with the help of
[Dungeon Crawlers Radio](http://www.dungeoncrawlersradio.com/)
.

The
[*Mistborn*
3 annotations](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/book/Mistborn%203)
are now all online, finishing with a
[wrap-up post on the whole series](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/364/Mistborn-3-Series-Wrap-Up)
.
[*Warbreaker*
annotations](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/book/Warbreaker)
are now going up, starting with one on
[the book's dedication](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/365/Warbreaker-Dedication)
. If you're not sure about this whole annotation thing, I'll be posting an explanation soon.

Tor has announced
[the book tour for
*The Way of Kings*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/06/brandon-sandersons-the-way-of-kings-tour-announced)
. I'll also be adding all the signings to my Events page and clearing up a few details such as: Which Barnes & Noble in Orlando? Which Powell's in the Portland area? I'll probably post the full details tomorrow.
Tor is also doing a
[giveaway of 40 copies](http://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/show/4502-the-way-of-kings)
of the uncorrected advance reading copy (and when it says uncorrected, it means it!)
[of
*The Way of Kings*
via Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/show/4502-the-way-of-kings)
. Last I checked, 601 people had entered. That's still better odds than most contests. Now, Tor only has distribution rights for the U.S., which means this contest is restricted to U.S. residents. I'm considering ways for my non-U.S. fans to have a chance to get their hands on a copy.

And if you've been following me on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
or
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
, you know that today I finished writing the final chapter (or rather, the last chapter I had left to write, which is not right at the end of the book) of
*Towers of Midnight*
. Now it goes off to Team Jordan for feedback, and I start into the revisions that will be required before the book can go into production less than two months from now. It's going to be tight, but we'll pull it off.
