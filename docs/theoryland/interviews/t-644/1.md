#### Marion Kippers

Hi,

Some time ago I posted some of the questions that I would like to ask Robert Jordan during his visit to the Netherlands, between 4 and 8 April. And now Dylan Verheul

*So, did you ask any? Did you get any answers? Anyone?*

In the meantime I noticed Aan'allein's fantastic reports as mentioned in his "Robert Jordan visiting the Netherlands: links to reports" postâ€”wish I had seen those earlier, they're great! Anyway, since I had already written most of this post I'll send it anyway, there might be one or two things that Aan'allein didn't mention yet. First a report, then some of the more interesting (IMHO) questions and answers below.
