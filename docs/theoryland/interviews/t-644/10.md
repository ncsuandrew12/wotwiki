#### Robert Jordan

I asked how he comes up with names for all of his characters, and he gave a nice explanation, with some examples as wellâ€”like Nynaeve is directly from the Arthur myths, Rand Al'Thor is from Arthur (and from Thor), as is Artur Hawkwing, Merlin became Thom Merrilin and Amyrlin... He keeps a list of names he sees everywhere, in myths, street signs, newspapers, or things he misreads that might be nice for a name.
