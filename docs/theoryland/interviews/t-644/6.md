# [Interview #644, Entry #6]: RJ in the Netherlands - Marion Kippers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=644#6)

#### Marion Kippers

Some FAQs:

#### Robert Jordan

RJ gave some pronounciations (I wondered how many of the Dutch readers were interested in thatâ€”the names do come out quite different if you're used to read and think of them in Dutch), he announced that Sammael is dead, and so is Asmodean, and it should be clear who killed Asmodean but he's putting in some more clues to help us found out who did it. And at least three more books.
