# [Interview #644, Entry #4]: RJ in the Netherlands - Marion Kippers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=644#4)

#### Marion Kippers

Finally I saw him on Sunday at the second day of the Elf Fantasy Fair, where Dutch fantasy writer W.J. Maryson and the audience interviewed him.

#### Robert Jordan

By this time RJ seemed quite tired, and he actually said so in reply to one of the more original questions ("What question do you think we
*should*
ask you about the books that we don't?"); we (the readers in general) manage to ask everything and more than he could ever dream ofâ€”he compared it to the
*Calvin & Hobbes*
strip: "I've just been assaulted with snowballs all the way from the sidewalk, and when I manage to reach the door, a voice calls out to me 'Hey, come out here and help us make some more snowballs!'"
