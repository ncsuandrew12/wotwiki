# [Interview #644: RJ in the Netherlands - Marion Kippers, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=644#9)

#### Robert Jordan

There was a question about a movie, for which we got the story about the NBC options that had passed, but now, with the
*Lord of the Rings*
movies coming up, there might be renewed interestâ€”the actual books would require a miniseries, but for example
*New Spring*
could turn into a movie. (In later sessions he didn't mention this again though).
