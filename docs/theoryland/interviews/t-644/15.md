# [Interview #644, Entry #15]: RJ in the Netherlands - Marion Kippers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=644#15)

#### Marion Kippers

Well, that's about it. There might be some other things but I think they can all be found in Aan'allein's pages (I keep mentioning them, I'm just so happy I found them). RJ said he enjoyed his first visit to the Netherlands, and I'm looking forward to seeing some Dutch influences in the next book...

Best wishes,
  
Marion
