# [Interview #644: RJ in the Netherlands - Marion Kippers, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=644#2)

#### Robert Jordan

I got to meet mr. Jordan three times. His first interview session in bookstore De Kler in Leiden was well-organised; there were about 80 to 90 people there, and RJ seemed more interested and open with his answers than on the later occasions I attended. The bookstore interviewer asked him all the usual questions, but it was nice to hear the familiar answers from the master himself. Oh, and I too heard him say that Harriet knows the ending ("she's my wife, she has ways to get things out of me").
