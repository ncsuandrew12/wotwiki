# [Interview #644, Entry #12]: RJ in the Netherlands - Marion Kippers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=644#12)

#### Robert Jordan

I also asked him whether Tam Al'Thor knows that Rand is the Dragon Reborn, and whether we'll see Tam again. He said that Tam has a suspicion from what Perrin told him, but he doesn't know for sure yet. And instead of RAFO he actually said we might not see Tam again, he's a nice guy but only a minor character and he doesn't really play a role anymore. Sigh. I would have liked to see him again... But then again, RJ might change his mind after all.
