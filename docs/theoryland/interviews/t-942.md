#### Catfish N. Cod

Long has it been since I posted on a WoT board, since the days of rasfwrj when the Net was barely cool and gophers roamed the Earth.

## [Entry #2](./t-942/2)

#### Catfish N. Cod

Latra Posae Decune, Cutter of the Shadow == Atropos, the third Fate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Very cleverâ€”hadn't thought of that! MAFO.

## [Entry #3](./t-942/3)

#### Catfish N. Cod

*Ta'veren*
Telepathy in Technicolor (TM): what was the point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

## [Entry #4](./t-942/4)

#### Catfish N. Cod

#### Brandon Sanderson

Deliberately blank. As far as BWS knows.
