# [Interview #103: TPOD Signing Report - John Hamby, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=103#2)

#### Robert Jordan

There was the usual mention of how many books. I heard three or so but then he said something else which I missed. It seemed to create a bit of buzz but I have no idea what it was.

He said he had no idea what the title of the next book was yet. Once again I did not hear the rest of what he said. I think though he said that once the title was firmly established he will let us know. Which is what he did with
*The Path of Daggers*
