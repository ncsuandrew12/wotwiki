# [Interview #103: TPOD Signing Report - John Hamby, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=103#1)

#### John Hamby

A few things not mentioned but learned at the signing.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan has not replied to any fan letters in the last year. I am not sure if he said he would be tackling the old letters or whether he would be answering any from now on. He did say he apologized for not being able to get to them. I think he said he was basically involved in writing something. (duh)
