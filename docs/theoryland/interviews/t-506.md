## Entry #1

#### Terez

I'm working on getting audio from Tam, and maybe I can get some video later, but for now, here's a basic synopsis of questions that were asked today (all asked to Harriet, Alan, and Maria):

## Entry #2

#### Terez

When I was in line, I asked Brandon and Harriet (mostly Harriet, since she was signing my books) if the Andoran royal line is descended from Rand's Aiel line (see
[this post](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=94394#poststop)
) [by Rhea, the Aiel daughter of Adan who was kidnapped along with several other women in Rand's Rhuidean visions]:

#### Harriet McDougal

I got a lovely smile from Harriet that told me she was pleased that someone had finally figured that out, and she said that she believes I am exactly right about that. She was a little sketchy on the details, though, and so was Brandon, so Brandon said it was essentially a MAFO. So I talked to Maria after that session, and she was taking a break so I didn't want to ask her about it just then, so I asked her if I could message her about it, and the other MAFO we got today, and she said yes, so I will hopefully be hearing more about that soon. Brandon asked me not to put that one in the interview database until I hear from Maria about it.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/answers-to-a-few-mafo-questions-r658)

Oops. I really have been terribly slow with these. I can’t find anything that says yea or nay on this one.

#### Terez

I think that Brandon got the impression Harriet was leaping on it too quick, and that's quite possible; I might have read too much into it.

## Entry #3

#### Terez

From the Q&A with Harriet and Alan (this is all really sketchy, since I was typing as it went, and Harriet talks a lot so she's hard to keep up with):

## Entry #4

#### Question

RJ has said that there is a touch of you in every female character. Which one do you sympathize with the most, or which do you think reflects you the most?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The one that comes most quickly to mind is Moghedien, but I think in truth it would be Moiraine.

## Entry #5

#### Question

You and Alan have worked on WoT for many years. Beyond that are there any other projects that you are looking at editing beyond the WoT?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

The encyclopedia is sort of beyond the WoT, sort of a 'fifth wheel' (laughter), and I'll definitely be looking forward to that. Meanwhile there's a project with a fellow Charlestonian that I'm eager to get off the ground. (more from audio)

#### Alan Romanczuk

We have a session specifically on the encyclopedia tomorrow. After WoT I think I look forward to working more in my garden and to continuing my career as a professional cabaret singer.

## Entry #6

#### Question

Are we going to get to see the other two prequels that RJ had planned on writing?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

We're finishing the WoT first. And...um...that's it.

#### Terez

(I don't think she was saying that there would not be any prequels...just that this is all she had to say on the subject currently.)

## Entry #7

#### Question

Is it possible to learn weaves from text, or does it have to be demonstrated? I asked Maria, but she gave me a vague answer.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

I can be very vague when I want to be, and this is such a moment. (RAFO card)

## Entry #8

#### Question

Are you going to be doing
*The Travels of Jain Farstrider*
?

No, but maybe
*The Killers of the Black Veil*
. I've always wanted to read that one. (laughter) That was a joke.

## Entry #9

#### Seeker

Can you name one thing that someone can do with the True Power that cannot be accomplished with the One Power?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

No.

#### Alan Romanczuk

You can get those cool spotted eyeballs.

## Entry #10

#### Question

What else have you edited besides WoT and
*Ender's Game*
?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Brandon has an editor on
*The Way of Kings*
. I read it for him, and it was a great pleasure. ..... (more—audio)

## Entry #11

#### Question

How do you feel about the idea of a movie—do you think they can do the series justice?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

I think they can. It will be interesting to see what happens. It's a huge task to make a WoT movie work... (audio)

## Entry #12

#### Linda

Who thought up the mindtrap? Any circumstances you can divulge...?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

I don't remember.

#### Brandon Sanderson

MAFO.

#### [Maria Simons](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/answers-to-a-few-mafo-questions-r658)

I know nothing.

## Entry #13

#### Terez

Was Verin at the Darkfriend Social? (This question was on Linda's list.)

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

That was Bela.

#### Terez

AGGGGGH.

## Entry #14

#### Question

When RJ first told you about the One Power, how did you feel about it?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Well, it was on the page. So I felt pretty much the same as you guys did.... (more on audio)

## Entry #15

#### Terez

(I didn't catch who asked most of these questions, so if you want to claim a question, let me know and I'll credit you personally in the interview database.)

Questions we asked Maria at the
*Towers of Midnight*
discussion:

## Entry #16

#### Matt Hatch

Is the Horn an object of the Power?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO, but I will tell you something about the Horn. People always ask why the inscription on the Horn is in the Old Tongue, if it's so old. It was added in the Age of Legends.

#### Terez

It should also be noted that, when a panel moderator asked the audience if we wanted to see the Heroes of the Horn come back before the end, Maria raised her hand high.

## Entry #17

#### Seeker

If Ishamael took the Horn to the Pit of Doom, and the Dark One destroyed it, what would happen?

#### Maria Simons

I have no idea.

## Entry #18

#### Question

Which plot lines will be important in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Maria Simons

Pretty much any major character that was not in
*The Gathering Storm*
will be seen in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

## Entry #19

#### Question

How do the 'Finns store memories? Obviously they don't just have flash drives laying around.

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## Entry #20

#### Question

Will there be any use of Portal Stones in the next two books?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## Entry #21

#### Question

Are there any servants of the Dark One among the 'Finns?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## Entry #22

#### Terez

Questions we asked Maria at the Sunday panels:

## Entry #23

#### Ishara

Did Mierin drill the Bore out of curiosity, or out of some malevolent desire?

#### Maria Simons

Mierin was kind of greedy. I don't think it was a malevolent intent, but it wasn't all pure and nice.

#### Ishara

Did her drilling of the Bore remove her choice [about becoming a Darkfriend] in any way?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know.

## Entry #24

#### Amanda

Are we going to see anything about how the Darkfriends or Forsaken take their Oaths?

#### Maria Simons

RAFO.

## Entry #25

#### Question

Is there any real difference between Forsaken, Dreadlords, Black Ajah, etc.?

#### Maria Simons

I don't think they're all precisely the same thing.

## Entry #26

#### Ted Herman

How in the world did Lanfear survive that gigantic explosion that was depicted in the
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Terez

[I don't remember what she said! WSB? I think Tam was talking to me about something, but I seem to remember that question getting fielded to the floor.]

#### Ted Herman

Maria didn't even say RAFO. That was put out for discussion, which I am fine with. Some thought she wasn't physically there, or used the shield weave that Rand used in
*The Path of Daggers*
.

#### Matt Hatch

Is Lanfear the only surviving person that is aware of how the Bore was created?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know. Mesaana or Demandred might know.

## Entry #27

#### Ted Herman

I was also RAFO'd on whether Noal has previously been inside the Tower of Ghenjei.
