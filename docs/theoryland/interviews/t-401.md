## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

My new computer came, which means it will be much easier for me to update. Sorry for the outage.

I'm just in time to warn you about a signing I'm doing at the BYU Bookstore at 12:00-1:00 pm today. If you're in the area, feel free to stop by!

I'm still neck-deep in
*A Memory of Light*
revisions. They will probably take until early April, so don't expect the progress bar to do much of anything in March. After that, it will begin to inch upward again.
