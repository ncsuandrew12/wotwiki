#### M. L. Van Valkenburgh

For new readers, Jordan entreats them to start with the first book in the series,
*The Eye of the World*
.

#### Robert Jordan

"You must start with that book. If you just pick up the new one you will be utterly confused within ten pages," he said. "Even if you only read Book One, and don't go on with the series, that's fine."
