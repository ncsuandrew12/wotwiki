#### Cognizantastic

As I understand it, Nightblood is most comparable to a Shardblade. However, unlike a Shardblade, Nightblood requires constant input of Investiture in order to realize his full destructive potential. Why is this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher kind of hacked in order to imitate another magic system. Shardblades are organic parts of the world they are on, but Nightblood is a bunch of souls stuffed into something. Nightblood is like a Frankenstein.

#### Footnote

Commentary : I think this provides insight into why objects that are more inhuman necessitate an increased amount of Breaths to Awaken. If the natural state of a Breath is to be attached to a human being, then perhaps all Awakening is creating a 'Frankenstein". Also, "imitate" denotes Vasher being cosmere-aware when Nightblood was created. Perhaps he worldhopped before the events of Warbreaker.
