#### Cognizantastic

Was Adonalsium Shattered by an external force?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Adonalsium was not Shattered by himself, herself, or itself. (impish smile)

#### Footnote

Commentary : I am assuming that Brandon was referring to the consciousness (I think the existence of Shards that embody human aspects verifies the existence of a consciousness, although this has not been canonized.), rather than the power of Adonalsium. As I understand it, this leaves 2 possibilities :
1. Adonalsium was Shattered by an external force, in the most obvious sense,
2. Adonalsium was Shattered by an external force, by having his/her/its power manipulated and used against spacehim/her/it, causing the Shattering.
