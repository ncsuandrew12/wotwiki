# [Interview #990: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: WITHOUT A SUMMER + Updates, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=990#4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, Tor.com has also started a reread of
*The Way of Kings*
in preparation for the release of the sequel,
*Words of Radiance*
, hopefully later this year. Two reread posts have gone up so far, the first one covering the prelude and the second talking about the prologue. And the ebook of
*Kings*
is still
[$2.99 for the next week or so](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1148/)
.
