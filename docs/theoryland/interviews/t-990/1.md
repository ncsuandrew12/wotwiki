This week's Writing Excuses podcast episode is called
["Fake It Till You Make It"](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2013/03/31/)
and in it Mary, Dan, Howard, and I talk about the things we do or have done to feel professional.

Also, as I mentioned earlier this week, Writing Excuses has been nominated once again for the Hugo Award for Best Related Work! Our announcement on that is
