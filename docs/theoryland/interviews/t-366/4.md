#### Gerhard Hormann

Unintentionally, you may have written the most ambitious work of fantasy in human history.

#### Robert Jordan

Maybe I have. But it is indeed unintentional. I did not know that the series would become this large, nor that it would this incredibly successful. To expect that, one would need an ego even bigger than mine. Every writer has a big ego, donâ€™t get me wrong, but to consciously have planned all this, you would have to be suffering from megalomania.
