# [Interview #366: Dromen and Demonen Interview, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=366#3)

#### Gerhard Hormann

Are there ever moment where you don’t think of The Story?

#### Robert Jordan

Not really. In the evening, before going to bed, I need to read something totally different to get into a different frame of mind. Otherwise, I’ll be awakes all night, with the story going through my head.

#### Gerhard Hormann

Do you have to work on it constantly to keep track of the storyline?

#### Robert Jordan

No, it’s more the case that I’m never quite satisfied with what I’ve written. I always think: this part could be a bit better of that part needs to change. When I continue with the rest of the story, I’m always busy rewriting previous chapters. The most extreme example of that, is the prologue of
*Winter's Heart*
. Eventually, I wrote 97(!) different versions of it. And I don’t mean changing a few small words. That was an extreme example. I normally write no more than eight to ten completely revised versions.
