#### Gerhard Hormann

Can a newcomer to the series read any random book from the series, or does one have to start at book one.

#### Robert Jordan

You absolutely must start at the first book. Someone who simply starts with Winter’s Heart, has no idea what everything is about. I never give explain things again halfway through; you’re expected to know it already. So anyone who have become curious, should start with
*The Eye of the World*
. If you don’t like it, it’s still not a waste of money, because I think it’s quite readable as a stand-alone book. And history has shown that everyone who has read that book, starts looking for the next books.
