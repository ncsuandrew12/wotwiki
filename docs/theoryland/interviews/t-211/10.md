# [Interview #211: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=211#10)

#### Robert Jordan

For Brent Ross, getting an agent isn't expensive. An agent makes his or her money from taking a commission on what your work is sold for and earns. Agents who want reading fees and the like are to be distrusted, in my book. You really need an agent, though, if you want to sell your work, short fiction aside. I don't know of a major publishing house that will even look at unagented submissions any more.
