# [Interview #211, Entry #3]: Robert Jordan's Blog: ONE MORE TIME](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=211#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For F Horn of Valere, I spend relatively little time with the notes compared to the time I spend actually writing. I do a refresher run-through before I begin writing, and I have what I call a "base notes" file for each storyline and each group. That contains the major things I believe might be necessary for each storyline along with reminders of where more detailed information is to be found.
