For Shiska, a mixed gender circle has X amount of
*saidin*
and Y amount of
*saidar*
available, set by the strengths of the men and women in it. Talents or special skills available to members of the circle other than whoever is melding the flows are not available to the person who is. If those Talents or skills are particularly needed, then control of the circle must be passed.
