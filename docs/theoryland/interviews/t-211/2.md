#### Robert Jordan

For DomA, I can't be sure that the logical patterns you see in the election of Amyrlins are the same that I used in making the list, but there are logical patterns to them. If Harriet adds to the Encyclopedia who was a strong Amyrlin, who middling and who weak, you might see more patterns.

#### Footnote

There is a list of all the Amyrlins since Hawkwing and the Ajah from which each was raised in the BWB.
