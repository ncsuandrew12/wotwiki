#### Robert Jordan

For Flavion, I'm sorry you've had some bad experiences with writers. I think a writer should either make an effort to be pleasant with the fans or else avoid them. Of course.... A fellow once wrote me a long screed, back around
*The Great Hunt*
or perhaps
*The Dragon Reborn*
, complaining bitterly, and I do mean bitterly, about the complexity of the plots making the books unreadable. I shouldn't have done it, but I wrote back suggesting that he try
*The Velveteen Rabbit*
as more his speed. In my defense, I can only say that it was late in the day, and I was tired.
