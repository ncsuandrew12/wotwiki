# [Interview #777: TOM Signing Report - Drew, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=777#1)

#### Drew

I asked him "Why the Glossary?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that they were instructed to "put it in" somewhere, and they could not find a way to do it that seemed to fit so they put it in the Glossary. Harriet added "I like making people read the Glossary."
