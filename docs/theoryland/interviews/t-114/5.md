#### Robert Jordan

The first book took four years. The next five books took, on average, 14 months. I finished
*Lord of Chaos*
in August 1994, handed the manuscript in, and in October, two months later, I was on tour for that book. I came back and said, 'There isn't time. I cannot write a book for you in time for you to publish it next fall.' I convinced them I couldn't do it, and it's lucky I did, because it turned out
*A Crown of Swords*
took almost two years, and so did
*The Path of Daggers*
.
