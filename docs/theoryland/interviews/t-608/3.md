During the walk to the restaurant I asked if someone channels in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, if he/she really channeled.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon confirmed this. He added that the real question would be if a non-channeler would be able to 'channel' in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. He believed that a non-channeler would not be able to channel, but would be able to create the same effects. So to most intents and purposes it would look as if they channeled.
