#### Question

Someone asked about the plotlines that will not be resolved in
*A Memory of Light*
, if Brandon could say something about how many that would be.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon explained that RJ left lots of information about the ending and exactly where everyone will end up. This included some direction about things not to resolved, which would annoy some fans (he mentioned Theoryland here). His estimate was that this is something like 5 to 10% of the plot lines, and all minor ones (we will find out what happens to Rand). However, he said that if you remembered what the outriggers would be about you should be able to fill in most of the blanks and unresolved plot lines.
