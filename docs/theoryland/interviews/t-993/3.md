where we cover a bunch of questions:

- How do you write stories that are important without being heavy-handed?
  
- Magical realism vs. Fantasyâ€”what's the difference?
  
- Do you have recommendations or techniques for serving as a beta reader?
  
- Is it possible to do a serial with short stories and novellas all in the same setting?
  
- Why do publishers say they want crossed-genre books, but they're not publishing crossed-genre books?
  
- Picture books and books for beginning readers: can you 'cast on this for us?
  
- Can you do a 'cast on reading aloud?
  
- What is the primary thing you've learned from reading Literary Fiction that has informed your Genre Fiction writing?
