# [Interview #811: JordanCon 2012 - Terez, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=811#12)

#### Terez

Can you confirm that there is only one Talisman of Growing? Because it looks like they found one in Ebou Dar.

#### Maria Simons

No, I can't confirm that. (Her expression etc. seemed to suggest that there was definitely more than one.)

#### Footnote

She was fighting a smile, specifically. I had con-head at the time; not sure why I didn't impart that detail.
