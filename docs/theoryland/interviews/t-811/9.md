So I've been wondering, and I think many others have as well, will we know for 100% sure what Rand's fate is at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Wilson Grooms

Oh yes. There will be NO doubt in anyone's mind what Rands fate will be at the end. It will sure to surprise and amaze people. When Jim (RJ) told me how the series ended I just shook my head and said, "Bubba, that is just beautiful. Just beautiful." So yes, you will all know.

#### Austin Moore

Ok, I was afraid that might get a read and find out type answer so thanks for assuring us that Rand's fate will not be open-ended for interpretation.

#### Wilson Grooms

Yep, there will be a definite confirmation by the end of what happens to him.
