#### Terez

Southpaw reported that Wilson said Rand's fate will not be left open at the end of the book; we will know what happens to him.

Here is a pretty accurate way Wilson described to me my question about Rand. It is not 100% word for word but very very close. We had been talking about multiple things for a bit so I decided to throw him a question that I know has been discussed here and there among fans.
