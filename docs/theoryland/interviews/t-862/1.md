# [Interview #862: Nethspace: Brandon Sanderson on A Memory of Light, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=862#1)

#### kcf

One advantage of having a blog like this is that over the years I've gotten to know a lot of people. And when the fan in me finishes reading a book I've been waiting almost 20 years to read, I know who I can email to possibly have a few questions answered. While, I suppose that this is an interview, it may be more helpful to view this simply as a conversation that I'm making public. These aren't questions that I thought long and hard about and these aren't questions that are designed to serve as a resource to fans, etc. These are simply some questions/reactions that I had while reading

), which I assume that you all know is the 14th and final book in
**The Wheel of Time**
(WOT) series. Ideally, this would have simply been an in-person conversation that I had with Brandon, but of course that wasn't in the cards. So, they probably aren't the questions you would have asked, but they were questions that I had.

Beware the spoilers! This short Q&A discusses
*A Memory of Light*
(AMOL) and there are spoilers in the questions and answers. Some of the spoilers discussed are pretty big revealsâ€”the details may not be discussed, but a few significant events are revealed.

Thanks to Brandon and his assistant Peter for making this happen. Enjoy!
