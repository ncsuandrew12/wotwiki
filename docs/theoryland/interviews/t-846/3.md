# [Interview #846: BayCon 2012 - Galley Table Podcast with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=846#3)

#### Phillip Carroll

*The Alloy of Law*
was the first book of yours that I listened to—I don't have a chance to read; it's like you; it's limited time, and at work I can listen—and I really enjoyed that and handed it on to my daughter who loved it as well. Can we look forward to the second book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there will be more with those characters; I really enjoyed doing that one, and so I will be doing more. There is the trilogy before, of course, which is more epic fantasy, and this is a little bit more a detective novel, but yeah, I plan to do some more.

#### Phillip Carroll

Do you have any idea when that next one will be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really can't say because there is so much that I've got going on. Finishing the last Wheel of Time is really a big priority to me right now, and then the second Stormlight Archive is a very big priority also. And so, I will do the second
*Alloy of Law*
book—I've given it the title
*Shadows of Self*
; I've got some plotting and things done for it—but I can't promise a time.

#### Phillip Carroll

Okay, thank you. That was one of my other questions that Zach sent in was,
*The Way of Kings*
. That's the one you just mentioned, you're doing the second book? Because I'm listening to the Mistborn trilogy right now; I just started on
*The Final Empire*
, and I'm loving that. Again, through Audible. I'm through the first third of it, and I'm having a good time. But that was Zach's second question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

When is the second book going to be out?

#### Phillip Carroll

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will be starting that as soon as the Wheel of Time book is done to my satisfaction. That's looking like maybe July, and then I will write the second book, as long as it takes. A book like that doesn't come fast. The way I'm a faster writer: I'm imagining eight months to ten months for the initial draft, and then it will depend on how long it takes to revise based on my editor's feedback and how long Tor feels they want to wait. I am guessing next fall.

#### Phillip Carroll

Okay. Zach says, the year that he read that book, by far, it was the best book he had read that year.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, well I appreciate hearing that.

#### Phillip Carroll

He's a big fan. When I told him that—they're all at Balticon, and I'm here at BayCon, and when they found out you were going to be here, he just went all fanboy on us.
