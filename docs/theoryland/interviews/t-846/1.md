# [Interview #846: BayCon 2012 - Galley Table Podcast with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=846#1)

#### Galley Table

You're listening to the Galley Table podcast from flyingislandpress.com, where we talk about science fiction, fantasy, writing, reading, watching stuff, and an occasional random question just to make it interesting.

Hello. Instead of our normal Galley Table, this week we bring you a special interview, this one with Brandon Sanderson by our very own Phillip [?] Carroll. Phillip had the chance to go to BayCon 2012—for those people on the west coast, that's the same weekend as BaltiCon—and he got a chance to talk to Brandon Sanderson about his projects, the future, the past, and a lot of things in between. So enjoy.
