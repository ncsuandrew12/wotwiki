# [Interview #189: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#17)

#### Jason Denzel

Another question was about why he chose, out of all of his ideas, to write the story of the savior of a world.

#### Robert Jordan

While he didn't go into great depth as to why he chose it, he did discuss how the story originally formed. Some of you reading may probably know that originally Rand and Tam were basically the same character. This character came home to Emond's Field (which was not yet then called Emond's Field) after having fought in many wars. He was not the prophesied savior, but the guy who wasâ€”wasn't up for the job and was unable to do it. RJ said that he still would like to maybe tell that story someday (presumably in another world, not his WoT world), and said he may write it some day.
