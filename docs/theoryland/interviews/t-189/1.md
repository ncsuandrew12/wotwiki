#### Jason Denzel

My weekend at ComicCon with Robert Jordan

It all started with that
*New Spring*
comic book that's coming out. The Dabel Brothers, a comic book production company that's run by (you guessed it) the Dabel Brothers themselves, had invited Robert Jordan to ComicCon 2004 to help promote their upcoming release of the
*New Spring*
graphic novel set. They've been wheel'n and deal'n with Dragonmount for a while now, and so I had asked if I could help with their booth at the convention. They were happy to have me, and so I soon found myself planning the trip down to San Diego, CA. (I live just outside of San Francisco, about a 7 hour drive to the north).
