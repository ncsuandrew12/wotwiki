# [Interview #189: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#20)

#### Jason Denzel

Although I was planning to not mention the name "Asmodean" at dinner, the subject did come up. Dara asked about some significant traits of the palace servants right before Asmodean was "taken".

#### Robert Jordan

RJ replied that the servants were just servants and were in no way connected to the murder.
