# [Interview #189: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#7)

#### Jason Denzel

When he was all done around 8 PM, he and Harriet said they would like to go back to their hotel. There were some problems getting the car back to take them home, so Dara (a faithful member of TarValon.net) and I called a cab for them. I paid the driver, and they were on their way.
