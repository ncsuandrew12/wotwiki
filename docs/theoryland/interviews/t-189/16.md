# [Interview #189: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#16)

#### Jason Denzel

Earlier that weekend, Melissa had been amazed when Brad and I told her what the "warm"
*ter'angreal*
really was. If you don't know what I'm talking about...go look around on the Internet. If you're over 18 that is. Anyway, Melissa was so shocked by this that she asked RJ flat out if it was true. (\*Smacks forehead\* So much for being dignified with our VIP guests!)

#### Robert Jordan

I was sitting right next to RJ and I saw his tiny smile behind his beard. He just said "Read and Find Out".

#### Jason Denzel

In my mind that translates to: "Go do a search on one of those WoT sites and they'll tell ya".
