# [Interview #189, Entry #13]: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#13)

#### Question

A question was asked about whether or not a non-channeler could go and become Enlightened through meditation and be able to sense the True Source, or even channel it.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ replied that there were indeed people in his world that sought Enlightenment in such ways, but no, that channeling was related to genetics. He went onto say that he estimates that the Age of Legends had about 2-3% of the population able to channel in one way or another, while in the modern world that number is down to about 1-2%.

Update: Robert Jordan sent me an email correcting this statement:

I went back to look at the article again and check something I thought I recalled. If I said the current population has about 1% to 2% who can learn to channel, then I misspoke, because I have set that figure at about 1%.
