#### Jason Denzel

The most interesting facts learned from that session were these:

#### Robert Jordan

There will be two more books in the main story sequence. Twelve will be the final number of books, not including the prequels.

Book 11,
*Knife of Dreams*
will be published in October, 2005.

He will finish that book in the Spring of 2005, but instead of the normal six week turn-around to get it on the shelves ultra-fast, he is insisting on a full editorial review. He has not done this since
*Lord of Chaos*
was published.

He confirmed (again) that he will finish the last two novels in the series (
*Knife of Dreams*
, and the untitled Book 12) before returning to write two more prequels.
