# [Interview #189, Entry #19]: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#19)

#### Jason Denzel

Later on, Melissa made a joking comment about Rand and his three girlfriends.

#### Robert Jordan

Robert Jordan's reply was not what we expected. He explained that at one point in his younger life he had two girlfriends at once. They knew about each other, and they arranged dates for him so they could both be there. They were fine with it, and young Jim Rigney just went along with it. (Wouldn't you?) He figured that if he could have two girlfriends at once, then a guy like Rand could definitely do three.

#### Jason Denzel

I guess it's true that we all find inspiration from our everyday lives!
