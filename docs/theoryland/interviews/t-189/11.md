# [Interview #189, Entry #11]: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#11)

#### Jason Denzel

One odd thing that RJ shared with us was his advice to men.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that men were like fish that had been removed from the tank placed on the ground. The idea was that a cat (a woman) watches the fish and often has no interest if the fish does not struggle enough before dying. The cats enjoy watching the fish flounder and flap around. But if the fish stopped, the cat loses interest. So Robert looked seriously at Brad and Bob and I (the only men present) and said, "Keep flopping and they won't lose interest. Always keep flapping!"

It was a little silly of course, but it sounded as if it came right out of the books. One of Thom's sayings, maybe.
