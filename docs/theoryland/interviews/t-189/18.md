# [Interview #189: ComicCon Wrap-Up - Jason Denzel, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=189#18)

#### Jason Denzel

At one point RJ gave a cryptic message to us about
*Knife of Dreams*
. A lot of you will consider it a spoiler, so scroll down to read it.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said: "Something that has previously happened in the series is going to be revealed to have a terrible cost." He added, "When you read it your reaction will be, 'Gasp. How horrible!'"

#### Jason Denzel

Scroll down further for some of my initial guesses:

Could it be we'll learn what really happened with the Bowl of the Winds?

Or what happened after the taint was cleansed?

Although this could be anything, his tone implied that it was significant.
