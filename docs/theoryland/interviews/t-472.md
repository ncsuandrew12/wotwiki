## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#1)

#### Aubree Pham

After the signing, Harriet retired to the hotel, and the Storm Leaders went with Brandon to Cantina Laredo (Thanks Tor!). We talked a lot about balefire philosophy, and Brandon said he always wanted to know what would happen if you 'shot yourself in the foot' with balefire.

He also spoke about some of his ideas for other books. One that he plans to write after the Wheel of Time is finished is about a world where super powers are transferred by disease and terrorists use penicillin as a weapon.

We also talked about a lot of topics that would be spoilers for
*The Gathering Storm*
, so you can find them on Dragonmount's spoiler forum under 'signing questions & answers'. Below, I've included the Q&A that happened at the bookstore:

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#2)

#### Question

What was the most difficult part of writing
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Keeping track of everyone, due to the exhaustive detail of the books. Brandon used
[Encyclopaedia WoT](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/)
often. It was also difficult to make the character 'voices' correct. Aviendha and Tuon were the most difficult of these, because they are from different cultures.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#3)

#### Question

What medieval Arthurian texts were in RJ's library?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet didn't remember anything specifically Arthurian, but there were a lot of books on mythology, religion, Asimov's guide to the bible, Norse, Greek, Cheyenne Indian. RJ wrote about the Cheyenne under the name Jackson O'Reilly. The Aiel are based on the Cheyenne.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#4)

#### Question

Is there any history to the term 'blood and bloody ashes'?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

No.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#5)

#### Question

Does RJ work out things like conservation laws, since he was a physicist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

From what I've seen, he considered it, the power that is doing all these things is coming from somewhere. They discovered the Dark One by finding the power (True Power). (They are) not aware of the source of the One Power. The Law of Conservation of Energy works, it's coming from somewhere, we're not sure where. It's not something the characters were considering, so it wasn't appropriate to include in the books.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#6)

#### Question

Are all the different cultural prophecies from a common source, and is it evil?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not that simple.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#7)

#### Question

Who killed Asmodean?

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

We could tell them, but I think they want to live.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#8)

#### Question

Why do you write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"If I didn't I would go crazy." He wrote 13 novels before he sold one (
*Elantris*
). He would write a book every year even if he didn't do this for a living.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#9)

#### Question

Is Cadsuane Ilyena reborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

First, I'm not gonna answer that, but second.... Ew!

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#10)

#### Aubree Pham

From dinner re: balefire philosophy:

Talked to Brandon at the Stormleader dinner last night. He had a few things to say on this topic:

#### Brandon Sanderson

1. The bruises on Min's neck were not an error. After consulting with Team Jordan, it was determined that indirect effects remain. Rand was the one who strangled Min, not Semirhage directly, so the bruises stayed.

2. Brandon knows of two ways to destroy
*cuendillar*
. But he would not confirm if the Domination Band that Rand was wearing was made from
*cuendillar*
. He said it was not relevant to what happened.

3. The bracelets did not disappear when Semirhage and Elza were balefired because they were not considered to be intrinsic to their person. It would be the same if someone was holding a book and was balefired, the book would drop to the floor.

#### Footnote

Moghedien said the Domination Band was a form of
*cuendillar*
, and the assumption is that Rand was able to destroy it because he used the True Power.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#11)

#### Aubree Pham

From dinner & signing both:

There were some interesting answers at the Dallas signing and Stormleader dinner:

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#12)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Myrddraal are not Trollocs who can channel. Their powers are totally independent from the One Power. They really are just throwbacks to the human stock. Harriet added that there are also animal throwbacks, but they just die.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#13)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The prophecy of the land being one with the Dragon Reborn, and the Dragon being one with the land will play a big role in these last three books.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#14)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When asked if the Rand's wound from the Shadar Logoth dagger was really contained like Samitsu thinks it is, the answer was RAFO.

## [Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#15)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The black/dark aura around Rand is partially, but not entirely, an effect of True Power usage. There will be consequences from Rand's True Power use.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#16)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The True Power is
*usually*
not able to be used without the Dark One's consent. Semirhage certainly thought that the Dark One intentionally betrayed her.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#17)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Regarding Mesaana's alter ego: Brandon said that he had been sent a reliable quote from a Jordan interview that she wasn't anyone we had seen 'on screen' as of
*Knife of Dreams*
(? he may have said
*Crossroads of Twilight*
? I need to find the quote). Specifically, he said that Laras has been around since
*New Spring*
. And would not say if Mesaana was 'on screen' as her alter ego in
*The Gathering Storm*
, because he doesn't want to limit good discussion.

#### Footnote

Brandon clarified this
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#1)
; a fan had led him astray.

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#18)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He would not confirm the Seanchan have the tech necessary to make
*cuendillar*
, or if
*ter'angreal*
copying would skip the need to also make the copied item into
cuendillar
. He did say: "If the Seanchan had the knowledge of how to make
*cuendillar*
, don't you think we would have seen it by now?"

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#19)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Rand did not use compulsion, or any other weaves, on Tuon at their meeting. Tuon's refusal was mainly due to her innate sense of self. At this point, she firmly believes that she is the most important person in the world.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#20)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mat going into Hinderstap with an empty cart, and leaving with a fully laden one was a nod to Stone Soup. Plato was referenced as the author of one of the philosophy books listed in the glossary. He said it was a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy....etc.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#21)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sulin appearing with Rand's group was NOT an error. Perrin is approximately a month behind everyone else in the timeline and will play major catchup in
*Towers of Midnight*
.

#### Footnote

Brandon clarified later; this
[was](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#39)
an error.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#22)

#### Aubree Pham

Couple more things my husband reminded me of!

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#23)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verin does have blood on her hands, but everything she did has been for the greater good.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#24)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The ghosts are definitely a result of the Dark One's touch on the unraveling Pattern (Brandon's phrasing).

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#25)

#### Aubree Pham

Oh! And we got Brandon to do a WoTized version of Shatner of the Mount.

#### Brandon Sanderson
