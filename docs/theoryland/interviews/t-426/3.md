(Also, WoT readers, I haven't forgotten you and am not ignoring you. WoT13 is going very well, and I'm excited about the progress. We're on target for a November next year release, at the latest.

*The Gathering Storm*
is out in November, I think I'll be more free to talk about what's in the next book.)
