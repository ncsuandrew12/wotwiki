# [Interview #426: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: DONE, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=426#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Also, WoT readers, I haven't forgotten you and am not ignoring you. WoT13 is going very well, and I'm excited about the progress. We're on target for a November next year release, at the latest. I wish I could give you details about the books, but I'm under some pretty tight restrictions about what I can say. Once
*The Gathering Storm*
is out in November, I think I'll be more free to talk about what's in the next book.)
