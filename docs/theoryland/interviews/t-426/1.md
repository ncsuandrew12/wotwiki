Housekeeping first. Remember that I'll be doing on-line appearances tomorrow,
[where I'll be answering questions](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/802/Online-Tour-(and-Twitter-Tomfoolery))
. The one on Twitter will probably be way busy, so that should be interesting. I'm getting to the odd state in my career where there will probably be far more questions than I have time to answer, but I'll do my best. Also, have you not seen Howard and Tracy Hickman's
[Extreme DM book](http://store.schlockmercenary.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=B-XDM)
? If not, you're missing out. It's awesome.
