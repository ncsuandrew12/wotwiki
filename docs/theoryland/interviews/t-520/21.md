# [Interview #520: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#21)

#### Luckers

Of the really strong channelers we know the nature to, all but one have been sparkers. This has led to the belief that sparkers are on average stronger than learners. Is this belief justified?

#### Maria Simons

No. "Having been born with the inherent spark apparently is not an indicator of strength. There are as many with weak potential who will channel whether they are taught or not as there are of great potential" (from Jim's notes). The stronger ones just get more attention.

#### Luckers

Do stronger sparkers stand a better chance of surviving touching the Source unaided?

#### Maria Simons

It depends on what you mean by "stronger" sparkers. If you mean strength in the One Power, not really. If you mean strength of will or character, perhaps. Jim said of touching the One Power unaided: "if you have not learned some sort of rough control, conscious or not, you will die screaming and writhing in agony."
