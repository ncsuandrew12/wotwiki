# [Interview #520: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#10)

#### Luckers

Why did Verin tell Rand that
*damane*
may feel him channeling at Falme? Did she truly fear it might be possible, or was she manipulating him? And if so to what purpose?

#### Maria Simons

I don't know if it was ignorance, or just sneaky Verin being sneaky. Either is possible; if the latter, I have no idea what her purpose was.
