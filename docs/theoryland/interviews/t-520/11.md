# [Interview #520, Entry #11]: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#11)

#### Luckers

In
*Lord of Chaos*
Ch. 30, "To Heal Again", Siuan, after being healed, says to Nynaeve that 'if she could heal her to half of what she was' she would be better off. This has led to the perception that Siuan and Leane are less than half their original strength. Yet in
*Crossroads of Twilight*
Ch. 19, "Surprises", we find out that both women stand several steps above the Aes Sedai minimum strength. This seems problematicâ€”the range of Aes Sedai strength does not appear to be so great as to allow for this. So the question is, did Siuan and Leane in fact lose such a large amount of strength as they appear to have?

#### Maria Simons

Yes, they did lose a large amount of strength. The range of strength is greater than you think, I believe. At the beginning, Siuan was near the top (and Leane close behind); if she were half the strength she used to be, she'd be in the middle. Instead, she's somewhere in the lower half, but not absolute rock bottom, nor nearly as low as Daigian Moseneillin.
