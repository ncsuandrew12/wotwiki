#### Luckers

In
*Lord of Chaos*
Ch. 20, "Heading South", Mat finds a Tinker caravan where the Tuatha'an have all been slaughtered. One of the Tinkers wrote 'tell the Dragon Reborn' in his own blood...Mat thinks, 'tell him what'? And that is the questionâ€”what did one of the Tuatha'an have to tell Rand that was so important? Also, was this done by the Whitecloaks?

#### Maria Simons

I mean, come on. There are still two books to come.
