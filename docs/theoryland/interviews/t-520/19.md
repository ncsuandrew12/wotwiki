# [Interview #520: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#19)

#### Luckers

Min says she was never able to master the 'ignoring heat/cold' trick. And we've never seen any non-channeler master it. Is it something only a channeler can do?

#### Maria Simons

It shouldn't be. Of course, it's been kept secret from most non-channelers, so that's not really evidence. I think that part of it is that a channeler is used to controlling things more—they have to have more focus and self-discipline just to manage the One Power, so they are better at controlling their reactions in general, and the trick works better for them because of it.

#### Luckers

In the same note is that why Min couldn’t mask her bond?

#### Maria Simons

Yes.
