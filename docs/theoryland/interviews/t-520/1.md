# [Interview #520: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#1)

#### Luckers

So Maria was kind enough to answer some questions for me. There is some amazing stuff in thereâ€”including the death of one of my pet theories \*sigh\*. Enjoy.

Also, this is Maria being extremely kind to me, and to all of you by extension. So appreciate her! ;D
