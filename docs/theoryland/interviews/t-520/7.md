# [Interview #520: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#7)

#### Luckers

On Falme, Rand and the Seanchan.

> Question: In Falme we saw Rand fighting Ishamael and the Heroes of the Horn and the Seanchan were mirroring the progress of the battle. Does this mean that there is something inherently evil about the Seanchan Empire?
>
> Answer: Nobody in WoT is inherently evil, except for Shadowspawn. At the time, the Seanchan were being led by a Darkfriend.

I almost didn't include this, it's so nitpicky, but you said you liked that. Feel free to ignore. Is this then to imply that the reason the Seanchan were paralleled with Ishamael in the fights was because Suroth was leading them? I always assumed that it was Rand's personal enmity that caused the correlationâ€”he saw both Ishamael and the Seanchan as the bad guys, and therefore, under the effect of the Wheel's push for the Dragon event, combined with the influence of Rand's

and the 'loose reality' resulting from the sounding of the Horn, the two got linked in the weaving of the moment? Was it then more involved with the links between Suroth and Ishamael?

#### Maria Simons

I can't really add anything to Jim's answer. It certainly seems to indicate that it was the link between Suroth and Ishamael.

#### Footnote

Maria was mistaken that the question quoted by Luckers was answered by Robert Jordan. The question was answered by Brandon Sanderson in November 2009 on
