# [Interview #520, Entry #8]: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#8)

#### Luckers

At the end of
*The Great Hunt*
after the Horn is sounded, Hawkwing goes to ride off, then states that 'something is wrong' and that 'something' holds him, and says to Rand 'you are here, have you the banner?' This has led to the perception that the Horn requires the Dragon or the Dragon banner to work. Is this perception correct, or is this a result of the Weave of the Moment, or just plain Hawkwing's sense of romanticism?

#### Maria Simons

I would think, given that the banner was hidden with the Horn of Valere, that it might indeed be very necessary for it. I have no idea why, though, or how.
