# [Interview #520: Plot Related Q&A With Maria Simons + New MAFO by Luckers, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=520#4)

#### Luckers

Another curiosity would be that in Rand's Portal Stone experience in
*The Great Hunt*
Ch. 37, "What Might Be", Rand sees versions of Egwene who are better at Healing than Nynaeve. The Egwene of the story can barely Heal. Are then the Egwene's of the Mirror Worlds different souls with different abilities and Talents? Or would this again be evidence that experience can temper Talent?

#### Maria Simons

This one I have no clue on. I lean towards the first explanation, but have no evidence to back it up, other than Jim's assertion that Talents are something one is born with and cannot be learned.
