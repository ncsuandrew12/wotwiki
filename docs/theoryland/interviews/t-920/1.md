# [Interview #920: AMOL Signing Report - Simka, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=920#1)

#### Simka

I was also at the San Diego signing, in line right behind Insectoid and Babokathy. Insectoid did a splendid job of describing the evening. I have never seen Brandon or Harriet in person, so I was surprised at how tall Brandon is. Harriet was just adorable during the Q&A.
