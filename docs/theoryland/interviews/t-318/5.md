# [Interview #318, Entry #5]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Merry Christmas! New FAQ!](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=318#5)

#### Question

Will you tell me specifically which parts you are writing and which parts he wrote?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe someday, once the book has been published. For now, however, I think that doing so would be counter-productive. The last thing we want is for people to read this book and instead of enjoying Mr. Jordan's vision and story, spend their time picking apart which pieces were his and which are mine. I suggest that you not worry about this issue at the moment, but instead simply read and enjoy the book when it comes out. There will be time for analysis later.
