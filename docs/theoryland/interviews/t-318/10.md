# [Interview #318, Entry #10]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Merry Christmas! New FAQ!](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=318#10)

#### Question

What other secrets are you going to reveal? Which plot points are you going to tie up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is one of the reasons that reading the material made me feel so relieved. While there are huge chunks that I need to write, there is always an explanation of what needs to be revealed, and what needs to be left for the reader to decide on their own. I will not be making any of these decisions on my own, but will instead be following Mr. Jordan's wishes regarding the plotting.

He ties up some very important plot points. Others, he leaves without explicit explanation. That was his way, and is one of the things that makes these books so wonderful. You don't need to worry, then, that I will try to explain too much or that I will leave out too much. I will do as the master instructed.
