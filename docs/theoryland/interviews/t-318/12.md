# [Interview #318: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Merry Christmas! New FAQ!, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=318#12)

#### Question

I'm not familiar with your own books. Can you suggest a place to start?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I include an answer to this one because I have been asked it quite a few times in emails.
*A Memory of Light*
isn't about me, but about Mr. Jordan's legacy and about the fans.

However, it does flatter me that people are interested in my books. I would suggest reading
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
. It's the first in my epic fantasy trilogy, and is out in paperback right now. It stands alone as a single volume and story, should you simply want to read one book by me. You should be able to find it at most bookstores.

Another option is
*Warbreaker*
, the book I've released on my websiteâ€”however, I hesitate to suggest this one, since you need to know that it's only a draft. There are still a lot of problems with it, as it is a work in progress.

If you want more information, here are a few other handy links:
