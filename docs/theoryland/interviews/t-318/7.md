# [Interview #318: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Merry Christmas! New FAQ!, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=318#7)

#### Question

Will it be one book or will you split it into two? I heard that this book would be really big, and that it might have to be cut into two chunks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will be one book. Mr. Jordan wanted it that way. I am certain from what I've seen that we will be able to complete the novel in a way that it will be published as one volume.
