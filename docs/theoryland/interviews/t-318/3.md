# [Interview #318: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Merry Christmas! New FAQ!, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=318#3)

#### Question

So is it going to be your book or Robert Jordan's book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is no question: It will be Robert Jordan's book. The notes he left behind are very detailed, particularly with regards to the most important scenes of the book. I will be following his outline with exactness, and including as much of his actual written prose as I can, changing as little as possible.
