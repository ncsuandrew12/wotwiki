#### Question

What will this do to the release schedule of your own books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You shouldn't notice much of a difference. I've already got my next two Tor books and my next two Scholastic books finished. They will each continue to come out at a rate of one a year in 2008 and 2009. I will have to work hard in 2009 to finish new books for 2010, but I'm confident I can manage it. Keep an eye on my website and I will post updates.
