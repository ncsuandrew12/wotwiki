# [Interview #318: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Merry Christmas! New FAQ!, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=318#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have been getting a lot of email—a LOT—these last few weeks. As I've said, I really appreciate it when people write me, and the overwhelming majority of it has been positive. I've been getting a number of questions over and over, however, and thought I'd better begin a FAQ to go in hand with the interview over at Dragonmount.

I'll will probably expand this as the months pass. I've answered some of these already, and others are obvious. My goal is to make this comprehensive (eventually). Once I have time, I will try to put this in HTML with all the questions at the top linked to answers below.
