# [Interview #822: TPOD Signing Report - Mike Steeves, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=822#4)

#### Robert Jordan

I had two questions for him. The first was if we were going to be moving to more of a "short timespan, lotsa action" format, since the past couple of books seemed to have fit this format (disclaimer: it's
been a couple of years since I've read
*A Crown of Swords*
, much less
*Lord of Chaos*
, so my sense of book-time may be off slightly), at which point he replied that he didn't deliberately plan the book to be in that format, but if he continued the book would be another 600 pages in length.
