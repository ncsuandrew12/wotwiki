(from
[Drew Gillmore's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#1)
):
*We also discussed what questions to ask. Most were discarded as frivolous, or obvious RAFO answers. I hadn't thought about it too much, but fortunately Chris had, and he had a few that he let me borrow.*

Actually, we were trying to come up with something approaching the "Canonical list of stuff that if we asked Jordan would get us thrown out" back at my end of the line, and having a blast in doing so. Some questions we had:

o Rand and Elayne—Incest or just Wrong Wrong Wrong?
  
o Aiel Logistics—Surely you jest?
  
o Aiel vs. Stormtroopers—Who would win?
  
o Aiel vs. Fremen—Plagiarism or theft of Hebert's ideas?

There may have been more—I was getting beaten by Hawk after she heard my first suggestion (Rand and Elayne), which may have affected my memory.
