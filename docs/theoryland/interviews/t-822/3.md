# [Interview #822: TPOD Signing Report - Mike Steeves, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=822#3)

#### Robert Jordan

(from
[Drew Gillmore's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#4)
):
*Chris used his moment with the Creator to open himself up to a huge RAFO, but
*his*
question was answered. Chris asked if Moghedian had been raped by Shaidar Haran. The answer was "Yes, among other things."*

#### Mike Steeves

Praise be to Jordan, allowing us to close out that question.

#### Robert Jordan

He also mentioned that Myrddraal
*aren't*
sterile, but that they would make a woman sterile.
