# [Interview #822: TPOD Signing Report - Mike Steeves, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=822#1)

#### Mike Steeves

Seeing as how it's been a good week since this damn thing happened, I'll add what few cents I can scrounge up amidst the pocket lint of my memory.

DISCLAIMER

I'll leave this in there, but I don't recall too much that was mentioned at the signing by RJ that would be a spoiler for
*The Path of Daggers*
.

(from
[Drew Gillmore's report](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=88#1)
):
*I was drinking most of the time, so my recollection of details may be a little fuzzy. My Wheel of Time was definitely wobbling.*

Wot 'e said.
