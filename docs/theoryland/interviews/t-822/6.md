# [Interview #822: TPOD Signing Report - Mike Steeves, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=822#6)

#### Mike Steeves

After the signing, we stood outside of Gamescape, and held a vote. I motioned for beer, Drew seconded, and after a quick stop in Gamescape (where I impulse purchased a copy of "Family Business") we were off to:

*The next thing we did was went to the Thai House to drink. Or at least, Darkelf and I drank, with a little bit of sipping done by Eric and Chris. However, Darkelf and I got married (Work
*that*
in, K-J) and consummated the marriage with a pitcher of Stout beer (Thanks, oh Dimly Lit Sprite). I taunted Noell with the thought that Cal would beat UCLA until with four seconds left in the game, I relented and admitted that, in fact, Cal would probably not be coming back.*

Let us not forget also the most excellent Oktoberfest that they had as well.

*After that, things \*really\* get fuzzy. We went to Amber, an Indian Restaurant, and had food, and talked. Rick Moen, Rajiv, Phetsy, Paul Ward, and "Justin" showed up. Other people showed up, but they were sitting at the other table and I don't remember all their names. (Someone else is \*really\* going to have to help me out here...anyone make a total list?) Mansur Ward made a cameo.*

Ken Kaufman was there as well, along with a couple of others, but like Drew said, they were at the other table.

*I had Chicken Vindaloo, that was supposed to be spicier than it was, according to Chris Mullins, but since I was already full of beer I couldn't taste much anyway.*

'Twas good Indian food—the Chicken Tikka Masala was, indeed, made extra hot and spicy, like I had requested.

After stuffing our faces, when it came time to divvy up the bill Rick suddenly had the need to "powder his nose", and was thus absent when we were collecting the cash. Of course, Rick's also a noted Linux weenie, and since he can't afford a real OS anyways, this is slightly more excusable in that light.

*Somewhere in there my ex-fiancée showed up, and I mentally checked out for the evening. I remember going to Brian's apartment complex for the rec room there, more beer, lots of pool, then a jaunt to Bill and Hawks for an hour or so. At that point I had been up for somewhere near forty hours, and had drank sufficiently enough in my sleep depraved condition to make thinking straight a tricky situation.*

After the pool, it was back to Chez Bill'n'Hawk, at which point I also tended to zone in and out of things. I think Lawn Order was played, after we all sang along to a couple of selected tunes from the Doctor Demento discs that Rick so thoughtfully provided. I think I slept, at the time.

*I'm not sure how it ended. Badly, one would assume, but you'll have to get that part of the story from someone who A) was there, and B) was
*there*
, if you know what I mean.*

Yeah. I know what you mean. There are rumors of other depraved activities, but thankfully I wasn't among the (conscious) participants....
