With all the talk about action and reaction and whatnot, will some force form to counter Sazed's new Ruin/Preservation mix? It seems to me like the whole nature of the world can't stand to have one person unopposed.

Ruin and Preservation were not the only Shards of Adonalsium, though they are the only ones on Scadrial at the moment. Sazed's ability to be both at once is actually something I drew from Eastern mythology, where it is believed that the ability to contain two opposing forces at the same time represents ultimate harmony. The Buddha, for instance, was said to have performed the miracle of producing both fair and ice from his hands at the same time.

#### [CHAOS](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129158#msg129158)

Is "Scadrial" the proper name to refer to the Mistborn world?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129166#msg129166)

Scadrial is indeed the name of the planet.
