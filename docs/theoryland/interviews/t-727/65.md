# [Interview #727: Hero of Ages Q&A - TWG, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=727#65)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (20 October 2008)](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129367#msg129367)

Folks,

This essay I just posted:

<http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/55/EUOLogy-My-History-as-a-Writer>

Started as a blog post for this thread, talking about the old books I wrote to give context to my previous post. It outgrew the length of a proper forum post, so I put it on the site instead. But this might help you understand some of my history as a writer, not to mention explain the origin of all these old books Ookla that references all the time.

I remembered a thread from ages ago in which Brandon
[posted a list](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=4573.msg86211#msg86211)

Thanks for posting that. Note that I can never quite remember which was first,
*Aether*
or Mistborn Prime. I always feel that
*Aether*
should be first, since it wasn't as bad as the two primes, but thinking back I think that the essay is more accurate and I wrote it between them.

This would be the new list:

1)
*White Sand*
Prime (My first Fantasy Novel)
  
2)
*Star's End*
(Short, alien-relations sf novel.)
  
3)
*Lord Mastrell*
(Sequel to
*White Sand Prime*
)
  
4)
*Knight Life*
(Fantasy comedy.)
  
5)
*The Sixth Incarnation of Pandora*
(Far future sf involving immortal warriors)
  
6)
*Elantris*
(First Published)
  
7)
*Dragonsteel*
(My most standard epic, other than the not-very-good
*Final Empire*
prime.)
  
8 )
*White Sand*
(Complete rewrite of the first attempt, turned out much better.)
  
9)
*Mythwalker*
(Unfinished at about 600 pages. Another more standard epic fantasy.)
  
10)
*Aether of Night*
(Stand-Alone fantasy. A little like
*Elantris*
.)
  
11) Mistborn Prime (Shorter fantasy, didn't turn out so well.)
  
12)
*Final Empire*
Prime (Shorter fantasy, didn't turn out so well.)
  
13)
*The Way of Kings*
Prime (Fantasy War epic.)
  
14)
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
(Came out 2006)
  
15)
*Mistborn: The Well of Ascension*

16)

21)
*A Memory of Light*
(November 2009ish. Working on it now. Might be split into two.)
  
22)
*The Way of Kings*
Book One (2010ish. Not started yet.)
  
23)
*Alcatraz Four*
(2010. Not started yet)

Will elements of your untitled
*Aether*
project be worked into the Dragonsteel series?
> *The Silence Divine*
> (Working title. Stand alone Epic Fantasy. Unwritten.)
>   
> *Steelheart*
> (YA Science Fiction. Unwritten)
>   
> *I Hate Dragons*
> (Middle Grade fantasy. Maybe an Alcatraz follow up. Unwritten.)
>   
> *Zek Harbringer, Destroyer of Worlds*
> (Middle Grade Sf. Maybe an Alcatraz follow up. Unwritten.)

These titles are news to me. You described two potential YA or middle-grade books to me and Karen when you came out to Book Expo, plus
*Dark One*
, but now I can't remember the plots except they were cool (and that one of them involved superheroes). Are they among this list? Also, is that really Harbringer or is it supposed to be Harbinger?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129386#msg129386)

Bah! That's what I get for typing so quickly. Yes, Harbinger. It should be "Zeek" too. Short for Ezekiel.

*Steelheart*
would be the superhero one, though that's a working title, since I'm not sure if it's trademarked or not. Haven't had much time for thinking about any of these books lately.

Brandon,
[here](http://www.timewastersguide.com/forum/index.php?topic=5165.msg111110#msg111110)
you said Alcatraz 4 is called
*Alcatraz vs. The Dark Talent*
; is that still the working title? Also, you mentioned
*Dragonsteel: The Lightweaver of Rens*
, but now you say
*The Liar of Partinel*
is a standalone. Change of plans? (I know you can't get back to Dragonsteel for a while.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129402#msg129402)

The Alcatraz titles are in flux because I need to know if Scholastic wants the fifth one or not. (They only bought four.)
*Dark Talent*
will be one of them for certain.

*The Liar of Partinel*
was part of a two-part story told hundreds of years before the Dragonsteel epic. However, since I've dropped plans to go with
*Liar*
anytime soon—
*A Memory of Light*
has priority, followed by
*Way of Kings*
—I don't know what I'll end up doing with the second book, or if I'll ever even write it. I was planning on not calling either of these "Dragonsteel" in print, actually, and just letting people connect the two series on their own. It wouldn't be hard to do, but I didn't want the first actual book in the main storyline to be launched by Tor as "Book Three" since there would be such a large gap of time.
