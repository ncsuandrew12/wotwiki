# [Interview #727: Hero of Ages Q&A - TWG, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=727#11)

I would like to echo a question that someone beat me to. The way you ended it seemed to leave the door wide open for other books with characters such as Spook and Breeze playing much larger roles. My question is, was the ending planned as just an open-ended ending to make people wonder about what might happen, or was that with the intent of writing more books in mind?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (15 October 2008)](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129110#msg129110)

I like it when my characters live on in people's minds. I have no plans right now to write any more books about Spook or Breeze, though what they do in the next period of time will create the history for the next series. However, there's a chance I'll change my mind on this. However, this ending was not set up for another book specifically. I just wanted to tell the best ending I could, and this is how it turned out.

(cross-post)

Brandon does want to write more Mistborn books, but not with the same characters. There would be two more trilogies. The second trilogy would be set a few hundred years later, in a modern day–type setting, when the events of the first trilogy have passed into legend. The third trilogy would be set a few more hundred years later, in a future, outer space–type setting.

It's such an audacious idea I wish he would write it right now because I want to read it, especially the third trilogy. But Brandon has announced his next project (pending Tor approval) will be
*Way of Kings*
, a 10-volume epic fantasy. He'll sprinkle in a book from another project here and there, so the next Mistborn trilogy might start before
*Way of Kings*
is ended, but it will be years yet before there is any more Mistborn.

But Ookla, he
[already wrote that one](http://www.amazon.com/Way-Kings-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/B000WH4TIA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224089786&sr=8-1)
!

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129102#msg129102)

I know. :)

The real story is that Brandon was writing (or revising?)
*Way of Kings*
when Tor offered to buy
*Elantris*
. Brandon signed a two-book contract for
*Elantris*
and
*Way of Kings*
. Then Brandon realized he wasn't in the point in his career yet where he could write
*Way of Kings*
the way he wanted to, so while he was supposed to be revising
*Way of Kings*
he secretly wrote the first Mistborn book instead, which he then sold to Tor as a trilogy, replacing
*Way of Kings*
in the original contract.

But for some reason Amazon already had a listing for
*Way of Kings*
, with a release date. Thence the fake reviews.

I've read an early draft of the first book, and it aims to be very epic. (No, Elvis is not involved.) I do wonder, though, whether when it actually comes out, the fake reviews will get attached to its Amazon listing. :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129111#msg129111)

This is all true. Note that the book would not be named
*The Way of Kings*
. Most likely, I'm going to make that the series name. So I guess the book "The Way of Kings" must be some kind of parallel novel or prequel or something... ;)

#### [PETER AHLSTROM](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129114#msg129114)

Oathshards is out, eh?

You're such a tease, Brandon. All these details about the next series will make everyone hungry for it, and then we'll all have to wait.

Of course, any other book you put out in the meantime will still be awesome, so we should be content, right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129115#msg129115)

I don't think Oathshards is as strong a name as "The Way of Kings." Plus, that's really what the series is about.
