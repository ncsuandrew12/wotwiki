Brandon, I just wanted to confirm that you did have a couple of cameos as Slowswift? Or was that mean to be someone else?

#### [CHAOS](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129145#msg129145)

I'm pretty sure Slowswift is Hoid. The Ars Arcanum says he "bears a striking resemblance to a storyteller", which I take to mean Hoid.

Slowswift is an homage to Grandpa Tolkien. A study of his personality will reveal why that name was chosen for him.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129164#msg129164)

Hoid appears in that same chapter, but Vin doesn't meet him. Something he does spooks her. She's just too darn observant for her own good.

#### Footnote

This is actually the first time Brandon mentioned Hoid.
