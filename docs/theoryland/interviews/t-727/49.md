#### [Xandeis (17 October 2008)](http://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=6655.msg129215#msg129215)

Is there anyone out there other than me that would pay to see this in theaters??

Well, I'd sure pay to see it in theaters! ;)

To be more serious, I think this series—particularly the first book—is quite cinematic. I'd love to sell movie rights on it, assuming I can find the right people to work with. So if you have any contacts, let me know.

#### Footnote

Brandon was actually first contacted by Paloppa Pictures to do the Mistborn Films during his
*Hero of Ages*
Tour.
