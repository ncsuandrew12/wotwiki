#### Brandon Sanderson

OTHER CATEGORIES
  
I don't have works eligible in other categories this year, but I do have a vested interest in a few other possible nominations. My editors Moshe Feder and Harriet McDougal are both eligible in the Best Editor (Long Form) category. Cover artists Michael Whelan, Darrell K. Sweet, and Todd Lockwood are eligible in the Best Professional Artist category. Howard Tayler's
*Schlock Mercenary*
book
[*Massively Parallel*](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2009-03-02)
is eligible in the Best Graphic Story category.
[Dan Wells](http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/?p=894)
' books
*I Am Not a Serial Killer*
and
*Mr. Monster*
are eligible in the Best Novel category, and Dan himself is eligible for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer (not a Hugo, but nominated on the same ballot).
