# [Interview #591: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: For Your Nomination Consideration + Worldcon Deadline, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=591#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hugo Award nomination season began this month, so I thought I'd let you know what categories my works are eligible in. If you don't know what the Hugo Awards are or how nominating and voting works, I also talk about that below. If you want to nominate, the
[registration deadline](http://www.renovationsf.org/register.php)
is January 31st. (You can also use this list when considering nominations for any other award that's out there, but for the purposes of this post I'm focusing on the Hugos.)
