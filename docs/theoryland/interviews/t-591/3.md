# [Interview #591: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: For Your Nomination Consideration + Worldcon Deadline, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=591#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

ELIGIBLE IN CATEGORY: BEST NOVEL

> *Towers of Midnight*
>   
> *The Way of Kings*
>   
> *Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens*

All three of these novels were released in 2010 by major publishers and are longer than 40,000 words, so they are eligible for nomination.

You may be interested to hear that no Wheel of Time novel has ever gained enough nominations to make a final Hugo ballot. Nor has a Wheel of Time novel ever made the short list for one of the traditional genre awards such as the Nebula or World Fantasy awards. (Though
*The Gathering Storm*
did make the short list for the second David Gemmell Legend Award, last year.) Guy Gavriel Kay spoke about this
[at the World Fantasy Awards ceremony](http://www.brightweavings.com/ggkswords/wfc2007.htm)
in 2007, shortly after Robert Jordan passed away. I recommend that every fantasy fan read his speech. He doesn't posit that Robert Jordan should have necessarily been nominated, but he believes the contribution that bestsellers like the Wheel of Time make to the genre as a whole should be recognized.
