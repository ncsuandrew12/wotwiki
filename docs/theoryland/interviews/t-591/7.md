# [Interview #591: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: For Your Nomination Consideration + Worldcon Deadline, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=591#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

TO SUM UP
  
The Hugo Awards have been presented every year since 1953 (except for a gap in 1954). When I was growing up, I knew that a "Hugo award winner!" tag on the cover of a novel like
*Ender's Game*
meant it was going to be a good read. Anything that makes the final ballot is going to be significant and worth your attention.

If you're interested in nominating and voting for whatever work or person you feel deserves a Hugo Award, consider
[registering for Worldcon](http://www.renovationsf.org/register.php)
by Monday next week and filling out a ballot sometime in the next two months. I will be attending Worldcon this year along with many other professionals and fans, and I hope to see you there.
