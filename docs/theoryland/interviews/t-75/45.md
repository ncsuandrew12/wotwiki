# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #45](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#45)

#### Question

What is Fain?

#### Robert Jordan

Mordeth + person. Mordeth is a human-made evil. The Black Wind gets along with Mordeth because of professional courtesy. Fain is anti-Forsaken as well as anti-Rand. He has a lot of skills and abilities outside of channeling. He can not channel.

#### QUESTION

Is this the "Another Power"?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

[laugh] I don't know.
