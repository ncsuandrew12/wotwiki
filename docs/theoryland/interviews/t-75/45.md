#### Question

What is Fain?

#### Robert Jordan

Mordeth + person. Mordeth is a human-made evil. The Black Wind gets along with Mordeth because of professional courtesy. Fain is anti-Forsaken as well as anti-Rand. He has a lot of skills and abilities outside of channeling. He can not channel.

#### QUESTION

Is this the "Another Power"?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

[laugh] I don't know.
