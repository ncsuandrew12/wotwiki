# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#21)

#### Question

How do you get your ideas?

#### Robert Jordan

I opened the closet one day and found three young women, diaphanously clad who had made themselves at home. They had hung up needle point embroidery and otherwise furnished the closet. I had a discipline stick available and beat them. Now, every day, they hand me a list of ten ideas.

#### Question

Have you been arrested for muse abuse?

#### Robert Jordan

They refuse to testify.
