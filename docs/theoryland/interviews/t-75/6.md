# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#6)

#### Question

Who was the one who is no more? The innkeeper or the
[guy on the barrel](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/books/acos/ch17.html)
?

#### Robert Jordan

[an amused look] RAFO.

#### QUESTION

Is the innkeeper an ex-Aes Sedai?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

RAFO.

#### Footnote

This refers to a
[dream](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/prophecies/dreams.html#2)
shared by Amys, Melaine, and Bair referenced in
*Lord of Chaos*
. We get a clue in
*The Path of Daggers*
that Setalle Anan was
[Martine Janata](http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/characters/m/martine_janata.html)
—an Aes Sedai who burned out while studying
*ter'angreal*
—and it's near-confirmed in
*Knife of Dreams*
when Setalle takes a particular interest in Mat's medallion. Thus she was 'the one who is no longer [Aes Sedai]', and she was the key to finding the Bowl. The guy on the barrel was Jain Farstrider (Noal Charin).
