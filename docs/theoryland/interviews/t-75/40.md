# [Interview #75, Entry #40]: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#40)

#### Question

Do all Darkfriends have the equivalent of the black threads seen in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
attached to Ishamael and Asmodean? (I have a theory that Fades may use these threads to travel on, you could ask about that.)

#### Robert Jordan

No. Fades travel where light and darkness meet. [handwaving]
