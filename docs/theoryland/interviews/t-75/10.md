# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#10)

#### Question

Was Else always Lanfear?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Else did exist as a separate human but was played by Lanfear after Else was expelled.

#### FOOTNOTEâ€”TEREZ

Since Lanfear as Else doesn't make much sense to me (Mesaana seeming more likely for a few reasons, not least that the 'trap' was supposedly all her plan, and personality), I asked Erica if maybe RJ didn't actually say exactly that. (Sometimes fan assumptions work their way into the wording, if no alternative is being considered.) Unfortunately, I asked her 17 years after she made the report, so she couldn't remember, but she did say it wasn't her phrasing (indicating that she apparently just wrote down what was said).
