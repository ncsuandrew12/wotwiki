# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#32)

#### Question

Is Thom Elayne and Gawyn's real father?

#### Robert Jordan

No. Absolutely no. No question about it. No. No. No. Thom is exactly who he says he is.

#### Footnote

RJ was apparently very disturbed by this question, possibly because it implied he had ventured into incest territory in
*The Fires of Heaven*
when Elayne decided to flirt with Thom.
