#### Question

How dangerous and how ambitious is Faile?

#### Robert Jordan

Exceedingly dangerous, not particularly ambitious. Perrin is due his due as lord of the Two Rivers. She has been raised as a noble with
*noblesse oblige*
. Perrin has been pushed into lording and she doesn't like him ducking out of what she sees as his obligations. She doesn't understand why he doesn't understand this in his blood like she does in hers.
