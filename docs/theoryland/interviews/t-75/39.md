# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#39)

#### Question

Is Moiraine's eyes-and-ears network independent of the Blue or does it overlap? How do they report?â€”i.e. does Moraine have someone who collects messages for her?

#### Robert Jordan

All eyes-and-ears networks overlap a little, but hers was pretty independent.
