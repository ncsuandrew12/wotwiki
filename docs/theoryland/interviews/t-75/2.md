# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#2)

#### Question

Tell us about the Blight.

#### Robert Jordan

You can not enter it from
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
because it is apart from NORMAL UNIVERSE and can not be touched. The Blight is not part of the normal universe.

#### QUESTION

Ask about the Blight. If it is not reflected in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, why does the Great Lord of the Dark have so much power over
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, the Wheel and reincarnation?

#### ERICA SADUN

See above.

#### Footnote

The Dark One doesn't have power over
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
as far as we know, but it's easy to see how one might have come to this conclusion after reading
*A Crown of Swords*
, since Moghedien noted that the properties of
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
and the area around Shayol Ghul were so similar that she could only differentiate by 'feel'. He also doesn't have any power over reincarnation beyond being able (with certain limitations) to 'catch' a soul while it is on its way to the afterlife (at which point the soul is out of his reach). RJ explained this further in the
[TOR Questions of the Week](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#3)
. There's no indication that he has any power at all over the Wheel, either, though he does seem to be able to corrupt the Pattern in a way with his touch.
