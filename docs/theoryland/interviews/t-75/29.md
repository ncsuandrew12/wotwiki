# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#29)

#### Question

Is channeling ability strictly, or partly genetically based?

#### Robert Jordan

Partially. [I] worked it a bit with some friends but just left it mostly hanging.

#### Footnote

Erica clarified that RJ said all of that, so apparently RJ sometimes worked out plot elements with his friends. [Which seems odd, considering other things he has said about his creative process.]
