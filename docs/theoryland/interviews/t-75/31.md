# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#31)

#### Question

Can weaves be inverted in a way that prevents them being detected even while they are being woven, i.e. so you could draw and weave with
*saidin*
, and no one would detect it, or can the weaves only be hidden after they have been tied off?

#### Robert Jordan

No answer. [Stupid woman and "how do you get your ideas" question.]

#### Footnote

RJ addressed this in the text at the Cleansing, when Demandred 'reversed' his gateways so as to avoid being detected. (Cadsuane's
*ter'angreal*
, which can apparently detect reversed/inverted weaves, foiled his plan.)
