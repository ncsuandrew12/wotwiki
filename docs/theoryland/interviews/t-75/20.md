# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#20)

#### Erica Sadun

What was going on in Aelfland when Mat went round and round and round the same location? Were they traveling in time?

#### Robert Jordan

Not traveling in time. The physical laws of nature differ. Mentioning the Dark One [in Randland] is bad luck. In Aelfland, it is \*REALLY\* bad. You cannot go to Aelfland in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
(similar to
*stedding*
).
