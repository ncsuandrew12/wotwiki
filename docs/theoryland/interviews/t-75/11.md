# [Interview #75: ACOS Signing Report - Erica Sadun, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#11)

#### Question

New Dreadlords? Via True Power? What are limits of True Power? When did we see it used before?

#### Robert Jordan

Access to the True Power is a matter of wanting it and the Dark One letting you. NOT black cords. In the Prologue to
*The Eye of the World*
we saw True Power used to heal insanity. The One Power cannot be used to heal insanity. True Power used at Shayol Ghul will fry you instantly.
