# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#26)

#### [Question (22 November 1998)](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/msg/96093139d3c132af)

One person asked whether Romanda was the Aes Sedai that Cadsuane referred to as being nearly as old as she was.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan answered in the affirmative.

#### John Novak

I was distracted by someone at the time and
*thought*
I heard that correctly, but wasn't quite sure. (And I gave the guy who asked the question a really weird look, because the answer didn't seem to make sense—why was everyone surprised about Cadsuane's being alive, if Romanda was just about as old? Apparently because Cadsuane is so much more heroic than Romanda.)
