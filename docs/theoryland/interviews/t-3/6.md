# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#6)

#### Robert Jordan

Moiraine lost her list sometime between
*New Spring*
and
*The Eye of the World*
. By the opening of the story, all she could remember was that there had been a name from the Two Rivers.

#### Footnote

The novel version of
*New Spring*
had not been released at this time. The
*Legends*
version included a mention of Kari, which RJ decided to remove in the novel version because of the confusion: ["Kari al'Thor. From Andor? Husband Tamlin, Second Captain of he Illianer Companions, took discharge." That pair might have gone anywhere in the world and there was doubt she had had a child at all.]
