# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#9)

#### Robert Jordan

At one point, he looked at me and added (with no prompting or questioning) that no, Mat is not Cyndane. He explained that at another signing, he had a string of ten or so people in a row ask him about Mat, and he got frustrated and belted out, "What if Mat is Cyndane?" He claimed he then recanted, but couldn't tell if the guy he told that to believed that he was joking. I admitted that I had heard the story, but it was okayâ€”we got the joke.
