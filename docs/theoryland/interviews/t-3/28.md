# [Interview #3, Entry #28]: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#28)

#### [Question (22 November 1998)](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/msg/8b6d199ccd93c061)

A lot of people asked pronunciation questions.

#### Robert Jordan

He remarked that no one ever seemed to read the glossaries. He also remarked that one of the taped versions (I omitted this earlier because I didn't catch the publishers) was just awful about this—they stopped calling for clarifications about halfway through the first book. He thought this meant they had enough to extrapolate correctly for the rest of them. They did not.

He ended by commenting that everyone was going to come up with their own internal pronunciations anyway.
