# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan began with a reading, which was fairly short. He read the first few pages from chapter one of
*The Path of Daggers*
. I think I'm happier narrating them in my own internal voice. He then commenced with about an hour and a half of rapid signings. I asked politely if I could stand off to the side and record the answers to any questions that he gave. He and the Borders staff were very gracious. They seemed to expect it, somehow... I will make one comment about Mr. Jordan: he seems like a very nice man. He was obviously tired (he commented at one point that he had hit some 27 cities in 32 days) but was cheerful, engaging, willing to chat and banter and seemed generally pleased to be there.
