# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#4)

#### John Novak

[Is balefire the eternal death of the soul?]

#### Robert Jordan

If someone is balefired, the Dark One can't reincarnate them. But they CAN be spun back out into the Wheel as normal. Balefire is NOT the eternal death of the soul. He also made a comment to the effect that even in the absence of balefire, there may be circumstances where the Dark One cannot bring someone back. There was a long line, so I didn't press.

#### Footnote

RJ expanded on these other 'circumstances' in the
[TOR Questions of the Week](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4)
(see Q3).
