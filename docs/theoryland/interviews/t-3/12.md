# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#12)

#### Robert Jordan

Someone standing behind me commented about the Seanchan being a bunch of sociopaths, and Jordan returned that the Seanchan system is a reasonable response to the conditions they found.

#### John Novak

I opined that we could have a serious debate in ethics over that point. I expect that in other circumstances we could have rolled up our debating sleeves and gone at it, but there were more books to sign and I didn't want to get in anyone's way.
