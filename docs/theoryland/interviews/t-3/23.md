# [Interview #3: TPOD Signing Report - John Novak, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=3#23)

#### Robert Jordan

He seems to have a half a dozen answers for the question, "Where do you get your ideas?" The one that tickled me was that he sends off to a mail order company from Trenton, New Jersey (I think) for some large amount of money, at three ideas per page.

#### John Novak

I looked askance and remarked that Ellison gave the same answer, except his ideas came from a warehouse in Peoria (which I'm sure I've read somewhere. Think it was Ellison.)

#### Robert Jordan

He shot back, "Yeah, but did you notice that mine are more expensive?"
