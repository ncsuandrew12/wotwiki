## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#1)

#### Question

Favorite thing Hoid’s done?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, sorta. A lot of his fave things have happened off screen that we’re not supposed to know about (yet). Wit is his fave role that we’ve seen!

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#2)

#### Question

Are the non-cosmere books related?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, earth is just generally non-cosmere, but they’re not related.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#3)

#### Question

How do you balance writing and family?

#### Brandon Sanderson

he said it’s like a quote he heard where being self employed is like working half days, and you get to pick which 12 hours you work.
compartmentalize and budget time (3 hours of writing, then 3 hours of family time, etc.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#4)

#### Question

You say you put limits on magic to make it interesting, do you do the same to characters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes! A lot of characterization comes from conflict in what the characters can't do.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#5)

#### Question

He’s taken programming classes, and someone wanted to know if he’ll apply that knowledge into magic systems.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, see: Elantris.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#6)

#### Question

Rothfuss and Butcher call him the 'magic systems guy'.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sabriel was his inspiration for unique rule based magic systems. Magic and settings are only as good as the characters. If you don't have good characters, you’re writing a video game.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#7)

#### Question

Favourite version of superman? (Brandon was wearing a superman t-shirt at the signing)

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#10)

#### the\_archduke

If the Lord Ruler captured Shai and gave her 100 days to craft a soulstamp that could turn an iron hemalurgic spike into a steel hemalurgic spike, could she do it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but she would need a boost of power to do it. Affecting an invested object is hard.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#11)

#### Question

Who are the 3 travelers in The Way of Kings?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We’ve seen 2 of them already. The third will be in the graphic novels that are coming soon.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#12)

#### Question

He was asked a question about creating Steelheart.

It boiled down to being unique with names and powers is hard, he had a hard time finding things that Marvel and DC haven't done already.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#13)

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#14)

#### Question

How does he keep what he’s read and what he’s written out of what he’s writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ehn, you need to be aware but also unique. you have to know what’s going on in your genre and other stories so you can stay unique, practice.

## [Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#16)

#### Question

Wheel of Time - Are Mat's memories from the past his own or other people’s?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Other peoples.

## [Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#17)

#### Question

Influences

#### Brandon Sanderson

People sneaking into other classes in the Rithmatist was based off of him doing that.

## [Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#18)

#### Question

What was your inspiration for Grandpa Smedry?

#### Brandon Sanderson

His mother, who was always late to things. He’s the inspiration for Alcatraz (he held up his broken phone to us).

## [Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#19)

#### Question

The way he got asked to talk about how he came to finishing the Wheel of Time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He got a voicemail “Hello, I am Robert Jordan’s widow. please give me a call" . RJ had asked her to find someone to finish his books, and after he passed away a friend read Brandon’s eulogy for RJ at the funeral, and the friend told her about his writing, and she read Mistborn then gave him a call. He said it was like winning the lottery but in order to do that your favorite author had to die.

## [Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#20)

#### Question

Have you accidentally written any other books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He tried writing AOL’s sequel but it was hard. It is easier to start new. Practice writing he does a lot to get used to different genres, but he doesn't really accidentally write things.

## [Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#21)

#### Question

Stormlight 3 POV character? Some say Szeth other say its up in the air?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he’s not going to canonize it or anything, he’s also looking at Dalinar and Eshonai and going to see who’s backstory fits the flow of the book best.

## [Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#22)

#### Question

How do you come up with names?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He takes a culture then breaks down the linguistics of it and its kind of complicated but he uses the rules from one language, then breaks them and makes his own? He said you can do it on a smaller scale, take a list of baby names from one country or language, and break them into their sounds and rearrange them and make a list where none of the new names are like the ones on the list.

## [Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#23)

#### Weiry

Whether the plague on the Purelake has anything to do with the fact that the magic fish form symbiotic bonds with spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Worldhoppers brought a disease to Roshar that they didn't have before. It's the common cold. Rosharans' investiture makes it so they’re usually a healthy bunch so something like the cold is kind of frightening. "Its a plague of the sniffles”.

## [Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#24)

#### Question

Renarin's eye color?

#### Brandon Sanderson

PAFO - Peter And Find Out. He gets to canonize it.

## [Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#25)

#### Leinton

Is Soulcasting blood a valid cure for blood diseases?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really, it's super hard to soulcast people/bodies, you’d have to get it so exact - their blood, healthy blood. It's very hard - basically you’d probably kill them in the process.

## [Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#26)

#### the\_archduke

Could a Knight Radiant pass their Nahel bond the way Seons can be passed in Elantris?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Theoretically possible and in fact has happened (!) in previous eras.

## [Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#27)

#### the\_archduke

Is the Ars Arcanum written by a person we have met yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said some people have met this person. I pushed and he said this person is from an unpublished work.

## [Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#28)

#### the\_archduke

Do you mind if people ask you all these fiddly Cosmere questions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He doesn't mind but warned that sometimes he gets obscure things wrong.

## [Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#29)

#### the\_archduke

Have we seen the 17th sharders from the Way of Kings interlude before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You have seen two of them, the third is from an unpublished work that will be coming out soon in graphic novel format.

## [Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#30)

#### the\_archduke

Will book 3 be Szeth's book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He used to think so. Now it might be Dalinar's. He is going to do the flashbacks for both (and Eshonai) and then decide.

## [Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#31)

#### the\_archduke

Is it possible for a Seon to abandon someone?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and we might see it in a later book. He avoided answering the follow up about how this could happen.

## [Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#32)

#### the\_archduke

Could you become a double misting if you took two lerasium/metal alloy beads (I think the example was iron and steel) at the same time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#33)

#### the\_archduke

Is Hoid's sword when he is the King's Wit an invested object?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It is a badge of office as the King's Wit. Hoid isn't even that good with a sword.

## [Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#34)

#### the\_archduke

I missed the question but someone seemed to be berating Brandon in line about how poorly Glys treats Renarin, like it was abusive or something.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said that that relationship is different, even for a Nahel bond. And we will see a lot more of Renarin in the next book.

## [Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#35)

#### the\_archduke

What is the relationship between Nightwatcher and Cultivation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I expected a hard RAFO, but he said Nightwatcher compared to Cultivation is similar to Stormfather compared to Honor.

## [Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#36)

#### the\_archduke

How long of an in book time break between the two 5 book arcs in Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

10-15 years (thankfully not nearly that long in our world).

## [Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#37)

#### the\_archduke

Will there be Kandra in the next Mistborn book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I think I heard him say that there was an appearance in Alloy of Law, but I am not certain as it was really loud at that point of the signing.

## [Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#38)

#### the\_archduke

Why can only women read in Stormlight Archive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Immediately after the Recreance an old book was used to argue for the idea that only men should be picking up the blades and plate, fighting was a masculine art. Over a period of 20 or so years this became established and some women used the same argument to take back some power by taking literacy for themselves as a feminine art.

## [Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#39)

#### the\_archduke

He said in the lecture that he took a programming course in college. He was asked if we will ever see a programming language as a magic system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We already have. Reread Elantris.

## [Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#40)

#### ZenBossanova

I said since Shallan has a unique ability of Memory from her blended surges, is fighting what Kaladin has?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. His unique ability is “Strength of Squires”.

## [Entry #41](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#41)

#### ZenBossanova

And Jasnah? (unique surgebinding ability)

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#42)

#### ZenBossanova

Can Vasher use Stormlight to Awaken things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, all it does is keep him alive. But he has tried and has not figured out how to awaken things.

## [Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1125#43)

#### ZenBossanova

This last one I got, was really interesting. I asked about predicting High Storms, because I was thinking of making a Stormwarden manual. I figured if Tolkien started with linguistics because he was a word nerd, then what is a math teacher supposed to do? I asked if knowing the positions/orbits of the moons would be enough to predict the storms.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said not enough. You need the historical records of storms as well because there is a pattern. You need that pattern and the tides, to correctly predict the timing of the storms. He said it was more than a simple beat. I then turned back and asked, “Are you saying the High Storms are music?” He replied, “I didn’t say they were music. (emphasis on ‘say’). You said that.”

#### Footnote

Questioner's speculation: I figured that was better than a denial or RAFO, so I let it drop.
I am strongly reminded of the Listeners and their rhythms.
