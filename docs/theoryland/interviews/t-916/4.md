# [Interview #916: AMOL Signing Report - Robert Moreau, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=916#4)

#### Robert Moreau

I asked Harriet what made Jim want to write fantasy.

#### Harriet McDougal

She said that originally he was against it, but she got him to write a Conan book, and he loved it and kept writing fantasy. So we have her to thank even more then just being an awesome editor.
