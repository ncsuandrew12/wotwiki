# [Interview #916: AMOL Signing Report - Robert Moreau, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=916#5)

#### Robert Moreau

During my second pass through the line I mentioned
[I was a redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1866a4/sandersons_qa_from_la_020813/?sort=old)
and he asked if he ever replied to one of my threads. I had posted a copy of
[Terez's quote collection of Jordan saying "Three more books" from 1995â€“2007](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/14q354/so_how_long_is_the_series_going_to_be_rjs_answers/)
. He then told the story that Tom told him of RJ pitching the series:

#### Brandon Sanderson

(paraphrasing Tom Doherty) "So Jim came and pitched me a trilogy, and he started telling me the story of this boy who is destined to save the world but has to die and gave a quick over view of the first book that ended with the boy pulling a sword that is not a sword from a stone that is not a stone." Now Tom knew that Jim liked to write long and offered him a contract for six books; Jim refused saying it was a trilogy, but Tom convinced him sign for six. He thought he was soooo smart getting Jim to sign for six books at beginning authors royalties, little did he know it would be another eight to finish the series.
