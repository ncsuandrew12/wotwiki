# [Interview #916: AMOL Signing Report - Robert Moreau, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=916#7)

#### Robert Moreau

The Memory Keepers where also asked to try and gather a list of the characters we would like to know the fates of and he would pass it along to Maria/Hariet to try and get those answered in the encyclopedia. There is a thread
[on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/184ehg/curious_about_what_happened_to_certain_individuals/)
for those who have accounts, but I am sure one can be started here as well.
