# [Interview #896: AMOL Signing Report - Ted Pick, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=896#2)

#### Ted Pick

In Mistborn, why is it that an Allomancer either has just one metal, or is Mistborn and has ALL? Why aren't there any that have just two, or three?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Originally he had planned so that people would only have one metal, period. No Mistborns. And then as he went along with the writing he liked this idea, but he really wanted to make some more powerful Allomancers, which is why he created the Mistborn. He did say though that if you are playing the RPG, you are more than welcome to have an Allomancer that can burn two metals without Hemalurgy.
