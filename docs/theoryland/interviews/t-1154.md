## [Entry #1](./t-1154/1)

#### Dirigible

Have we seen a Svrakiss in a book so far?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Um...RAFO"

## [Entry #2](./t-1154/2)

#### Dirigible

"Can you tell us anything about Svrakiss, like are they originally from Sel?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Um...I'm not going to go into that."

## [Entry #3](./t-1154/3)

#### Dirigible

"Is the cognitive realm flat or spherical?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"The cognitive realm is this weird thing, where it's flat, but it's distorted."

#### Question

"Yeah, 'cause I was going to say, if you make a globe flat..."

#### Brandon Sanderson

"You can walk from one planet to the next. So it's got really weird...the spatial reasoning doesn't work the same way."

#### Tags

cognitive realm

## [Entry #4](./t-1154/4)

#### Dirigible

"The Expanse of Broken Sky, is that Sel?"

(something I can't make out....it was a RAFO; I don't think he said anything more)

#### Footnote

incomplete answer

## [Entry #5](./t-1154/5)

#### Dirigible

"Can you be Connected to two locations at once?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"RAFO"

#### Tags

connection
,

Sel

## [Entry #6](./t-1154/6)

#### Dirigible

"Can you store different types of Connection at different times? Like can you store Connection to people versus location?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is possible."

## [Entry #7](./t-1154/7)

#### Dirigible

"Can you store....like if there is a Twinborn, who is a Gold Allomancer and a Duralumin Ferring, would his gold shadow change based on what his Connection is?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm going to RAFO that."

## [Entry #8](./t-1154/8)

#### Dirigible

"Can you store any sort of Temporal Connection?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Um, most".

## [Entry #9](./t-1154/9)

#### Dirigible

"Could someone who's never been to Scadrial be Connected to Ruin, Preservation, or Harmony?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Possibly. Depends on the strength of the Connection. But yeah, Connection's not an on/off switch."

## [Entry #10](./t-1154/10)

#### Dirigible

"If you tap Connection in one area, for location, would that remove your Connection to your original place, where you're actually from?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #11](./t-1154/11)

"It doesn't."

Yes it is. (With a big smile on his face.)

## [Entry #13](./t-1154/13)

#### Nashan'Elin

Could Honor and Autonomy be considered opposites, like, Autonomy freeing from Honor's oaths?

#### Silverblade5

Would hemalurgy on roshar require spikes to be made of gemstones?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.
