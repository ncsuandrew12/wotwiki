"Is the cognitive realm flat or spherical?"

"The cognitive realm is this weird thing, where it's flat, but it's distorted."

#### Question

"Yeah, 'cause I was going to say, if you make a globe flat..."

#### Brandon Sanderson

"You can walk from one planet to the next. So it's got really weird...the spatial reasoning doesn't work the same way."

That is possible."

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1154#7)

#### Dirigible

"Can you store....like if there is a Twinborn, who is a Gold Allomancer and a Duralumin Ferring, would his gold shadow change based on what his Connection is?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I'm going to RAFO that."
