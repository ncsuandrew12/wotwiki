#### Orbit Books

Do you think of the Wheel of Time as one very long novel, or as a series of separate novels?

#### Robert Jordan

To me, the Wheel of Time is one very long novel, with the individual books being sections of the novel. I try to provide a certain amount of resolution within each book, but a reader must begin with the first. It really isn't any more possible to pick up the newest book and begin there than it is to try beginning any other novel with only the last few chapters.
