# [Interview #1055, Entry #6]: Interview with NY Times bestselling 'Mistborn' & 'Steelheart' author Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1055#6)

#### Henry L. Herz

What is your favorite creature that exists only in literature?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow! What a fantastic question! The problem is I think that everyone in my position is going to say dragon. Many of us got started in fantasy by reading books about dragons, so there's a special place for cool dragons in a fantasy writer's heart. For example, Anne McCaffrey's books are part of what pulled me into fantasy in the first place, so I'd have to take the cliched route and say dragons, but I would specifically pick her dragons.

#### Henry L. Herz

Dragon is a go-to answer, but we've certainly had others. No question, dragons are an oldie, but a goodie. McCaffrey's dragons were far more user-friendly than Tolkien's Smaug and Glaurung.
