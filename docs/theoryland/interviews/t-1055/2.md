# [Interview #1055: Interview with NY Times bestselling 'Mistborn' & 'Steelheart' author Brandon Sanderson, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1055#2)

#### Henry L. Herz

Tell us about your writing process.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am an outliner. I like to have books with explosive endings, and to manage this—for me—I need to know what is going to happen in the story. I generally plot my books backward, starting my outline with the ending, then I work my way forward. When I write, I go the other direction.

#### Henry L. Herz

Well, your technique works, even if it flips the Cheshire Cat's advice on its head. Keep it up, sir!

*"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
  
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
  
"I don't much care where," said Alice.
  
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat. — Alice in Wonderland*
