# [Interview #1055, Entry #5]: Interview with NY Times bestselling 'Mistborn' & 'Steelheart' author Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1055#5)

#### Henry L. Herz

If you could have three authors over for dinner, who would it be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

First would be Robert Jordan, easily, because I would like to question him about the things he wanted to do with the Wheel of Time that he didn't leave us notes on and get answers to the questions that he didn't leave us answers for. Then I would pick Terry Pratchett because I've seen him at conventions and he seems like a blast. After that, probably Moses. I'd have to get an interpreter, but hanging out with Moses would be pretty awesome, and I would have a lot of questions for him as well.

#### Henry L. Herz

Great choices (and what an honor for you to be chosen to complete Robert Jordan's work). And kudos for remembering you'd need an interpreter for Moses. Can you imagine how frustrating it would be to have Moses over for dinner, but not be able to converse with him? I'm guessing dinner would include matzoh and quail.
