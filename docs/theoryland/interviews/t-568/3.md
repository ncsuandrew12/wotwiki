#### Hilwa Katir

After the signing a small group of us,not wanting to end this magical day went to Grendel's Den and had dinner. Thank you Alric, it was a perfect place to talk, eat, have a drink and re-hash the events of the day.

I would like to end this report by mentioning the dedication of the Towers of Midnight. What a tribute!

I offer my sincere Thanks to Brandon, Harriet and all of you who work behind the scenes. This was a great signing because of all your hard work and dedication and the Troopers and I thank you so much for this opportunity.

May your Memory Be Eternal Creator!
