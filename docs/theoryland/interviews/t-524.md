I've been posting scene-by-scene statistics for my line edit of
*Towers of Midnight*
(which you can see on the sidebar of my site is 85% done). I'm going through and tightening the language, with a target of trimming each chapter by ten to fifteen percent. What does that mean in practice? I can't share examples from this book, but in
[this week's Writing Excuses podcast episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/07/25/)
Dan, Howard, and I talk about how to do this sort of tightening revision using the first book I ever wrote, back in 1994. Some fans have urged me not to cut, or to release an "author's preferred text" edition at a later date; trust me, the version you'll see on the shelf is my preferred text. Every book I've published has gone through a similar ten to fifteen percent cut, and not because a publisher or editor demanded it. This is an integral part of my writing process, and
[listening to the episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/07/25/)
will show you exactly why.
