He said to ask questions in the next 15 minutes, does this mean we wont get answers now that 3 hours have passed? Disregard my question if he answers in the meantime.

#### Tinkerboots

Why don't you ask a question and see if he answers?

#### SkyCyril

They recorded a video of Brandon answering questions that were posted in the first 15 minutes or so. The video will likely be posted Sunday.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nope, I won't answer any more questions in this thread.

Wait.

#### Angerfist

Thank you for answering my question about you answering your questions.
