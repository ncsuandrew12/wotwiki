What are you currently reading and how is it affecting what you write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I just finished a friend's book, which is as of yet unpublished. It's different enough that I am not worried about influence worming its way into
*Words of Radiance*
—but reading
*Promise of Blood*
(which is what I read just before) did make me want to go write more
*Alloy of Law*
era Mistborn stories.
