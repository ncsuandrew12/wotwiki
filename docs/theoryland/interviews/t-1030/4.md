You've mentioned that the Stormlight Archive is broken down into two sets of five books. Is the story arch of the second set of books going to be completely different than the story in the first 5 books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will focus mostly on different characters, with some appearances by characters from the first five. I wouldn't call it a different story, more a sequel.
