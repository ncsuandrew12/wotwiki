#### Question (read by Brandon)

How is it going with
*Words of Radiance*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ah, yeah. It's going. It will meet the March deadline, this one. The reason it got delayed just was a couple of things, mostly that this year has been so busy for me. I wanted to give the book the time it needed, we needed time on the art. I just turned in the first chunk of the next draft to my editor. It looks our deadline to turn it in is November 1st, and that's what weâ€™re going to want to do, is bring the last draft to be copy edited then. So it's going all right.
