Hi Brandon. You've been involved with a few video games, including Infinity Blade and the (eventually) upcoming Mistborn game.

What kind of games do you like to play? Any particular favorites for their story or gameplay?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I LOVED the inFamous games for their stories, though my favorite games of recent years have been Civ V and Dark Souls/Demons Souls.
