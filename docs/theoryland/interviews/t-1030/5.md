What are your thoughts on the cover for
*Words of Radiance*
? I know there has been some criticism, but I think it's great.
*The Way of Kings*
is one of my favorite covers in recent memory, as well.

Also, does it look like there will be extra copies of
*Firstborn/Defending Elysium*
that will end up on sale eventually?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I love the cover, but I'm a self-professed Whelan fanboy. It's hard for me to be objective about his work.

I'm pretty sure we'll have leftovers. Peter (my assistant) was adamant about ordering enough copies that everyone on-line can get a copy if they really want one. So we'll have enough to sell through the holidays, I'm pretty sure. As this is my last con of the season, they'll probably go up soon.
