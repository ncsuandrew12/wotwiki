# [Interview #960: Brandon Sanderson finishes Robert Jordan's bestselling Wheel of Time Series with A Memory of Light, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=960#4)

#### Indy Week

And what was the biggest challenge of keeping your own voice in the mix, while staying consistent with Jordan's voice from the books before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that was a big challenge. Fortunately, I had Harriet for that. Harriet was the editor on all of the Wheel of Time books, and was able to point out all those inconsistencies, along with a lot of line-editing to smooth over the issues between what I had written and what Robert Jordan had written, things like that. One of the reasons why this project was even feasible was because Harriet was involved.
