# [Interview #960: Brandon Sanderson finishes Robert Jordan's bestselling Wheel of Time Series with A Memory of Light, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=960#2)

#### Indy Week

Does it feel like the weight of the world is off your shoulders a bit?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it does. That's a good way of phrasing it. This project's been unlike any other. In a lot of ways, as a writer, when I write something, normally I feel beholden only to myself. I do what I feel is best, and I just write the story.

But with this project, I didn't feel that was right. This story doesn't belong to me; it belongs to the fans. I'm kind of a stepfather, in a lot of ways. So there was a lot more performance anxiety for this project than any book before that.
