# [Interview #960: Brandon Sanderson finishes Robert Jordan's bestselling Wheel of Time Series with A Memory of Light, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=960#7)

#### Indy Week

Would you ever consider trying to finish another series, or was it more of a one-time thing for you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I really feel this was a one-time thing for me. The only reason I was able to do this was because I had read the series multiple times, and had followed it since childhood. But beyond that, when I was consciously writing my own books, I had learned my style from Robert Jordan. His style and my style share a number of things. The fact that there are certain similarities is what let me to work on these books. I don't think I'd be appropriate for any other author out there. I'd just be the wrong choice.

It's not something I ever expect to do againâ€”I loved doing it, but now it's time I give my own work its due.
