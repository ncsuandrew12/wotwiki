# [Interview #960: Brandon Sanderson finishes Robert Jordan's bestselling Wheel of Time Series with A Memory of Light, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=960#5)

#### Indy Week

Harriet's going to be at the signing with you—I imagine that there's going to be a real overall tribute to The Wheel of Time at this event.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. What we usually do is the Q-and-A with fans, which is probably the last time they’ll get a chance at a signing like this to ask whatever they want, so we want to give them that—what it was like working with Robert Jordan, how the series came to be. A lot of times, fans are very excited to see Harriet and give her standing ovations. She was the driving force behind this—she discovered Robert Jordan as a writer and was behind The Wheel of Time getting published in the first place.

There’s a lot of tributes to her and Robert at these events, and they get pretty emotional, because for fans, these books were part of our lives. I started reading these when I was 15. I’m 37 now! The Wheel of Time has been with me longer than anything else. It’s been with me since before I wanted to be a writer, longer than I’ve known any friends that I’ve had.

#### Indy Week

That's got to be a hell of an emotional experience for you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. The end it all is really weird . . . just to be at the end. And it's bittersweet, in more than one way, that I got to see it through to its ending, that I got to be part of it, but . . . this is it! There are no more Wheel of Time books to wait for. And that's a surreal feeling, to realize that it's all done now.

#### Indy Week

And it's got to be doubly overwhelming for you, as a fan and a writer.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. Granted, I had more time to steel myself for it. I got to read the ending Robert Jordan wrote, the epilogue . . . wow, back in 2007. I was one of the few who got to read that, to see that ending, and know how it ended.

There was still a lot of work to do, but I knew, "This is the ending, and I've got to prepare myself for it, because I know what it is."

For the fans, what they're feeling now, I started feeling it in 2007.
