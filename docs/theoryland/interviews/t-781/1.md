# [Interview #781, Entry #1]: TOM Signing Report - Seafolk Sedai](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=781#1)

#### Seafolk Sedai

Before the Cincinnati signing, I asked Brandon if Lanfear wrote Mirrors of the Wheel.

#### Brandon Sanderson

His response was "RAFO" and then when I looked surprised that it was actually that important an answer he changed it to mean that he had to look it up. :D
