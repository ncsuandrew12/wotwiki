# [Interview #32: LOC Signing Report - Dennis Higbee, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=32#1)

#### Dennis Higbee

I was at the Robert Jordan signing today at Forbidden Planet on 12th and Broadway in lower Manhattan, NYC. I'm not going to set the scene, except to say that the line wasn't too long, and it moved well. I found him and his wife (who was also present) to be a charming and personable couple. They went out of their way to by nice and patiently answered all my questions. None of them were really of any significance, but he did identify me as a net-denizen from the question "Is Bela
*ta'veren*
?" (Yes, I know it's been done, but I could not help myself.)
