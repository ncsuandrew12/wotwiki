## [Entry #1](./t-752/1)

#### Amadine

#### Brandon Sanderson

Amadine just reported that the answer to Terez's question of 'Was Taim's palace made from Shayol Ghul stone' was 'yes'.

#### LUCKERS (LATER)

Here is the message I sent Ama: Tell Brandon I said hi. Oh, and ask if Taim's palace is made of Shayol Ghul rock. Tell him Terez was very cranky with me that I didn't ask. LOL. James.

Ama's reply: The answer is yes!!!

#### Footnote

It's actually the walls and the podium that are made out of Shayol Ghul rock. See
