# [Interview #48: LOC Signing Report - Michael Thompson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=48#4)

#### Harriet McDougal

When we got to the head of the line, Harriet was taking the books, and opening them to get them ready. I handed her a copy of Reagan O'Neal's
*The Fallon Blood*
, and asked if he would mind signing it. She exclaimed over how long it had been since she'd seen that book.

#### Robert Jordan

He exclaimed over it too, and signed it 'Reagan O'Neal'. I asked him if Lord Valentine's Castle in any way inspired the menagerie scenes and he said, "No."
