# [Interview #48: LOC Signing Report - Michael Thompson, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=48#2)

#### Question

The young man asked "Who was BAY-doe-mun?"

#### Robert Jordan

There was a pause. I speculated this was a mispronunciation of 'Beidomon' and Jordan had to figure out what was being asked, followed by the usual, "You'll have to read the books."
