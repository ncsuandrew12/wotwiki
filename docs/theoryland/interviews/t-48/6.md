# [Interview #48: LOC Signing Report - Michael Thompson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=48#6)

#### Michael Thompson

Lorie and I went and begged the Tor rep for posters while Aline was getting her books signed. He looked in his trunk, but no posters. Then we left. The line was still out the door, but only two or three people worth.

The limo was black, FWIW.
