#### Question

Do the Forsaken consider themselves Darkfriends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oooh, you are tricky! I know what you're doing. I would say that, in general, yes they do consider themselves Darkfriends, though there are ways somebody would be able to get around that. I would say, yes, that that is not the sort of mental gymnastics that...it is very easy to convince yourself that you are not a Darkfriend.
