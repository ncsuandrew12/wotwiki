#### Question

Are the Aiel linked in some way to the Ogier, in that they both have that capability in making things grow, and that they and the Nym all worked together in the scene from the Age of Legends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, everybody is connected in the Pattern, and certainly the Aiel would have threads connecting them to the Ogier. I can't really say anything too specific about it.
