# [Interview #476: TGS Signing Report - Robert Moreau, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=476#6)

#### Question

I got the impression from somewhere that the Aiel were a result of tampering, to some degree, with the One Power. Am I insane, or is that based in reality?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not heard that before.

#### Question

I donâ€™t know where I got that from.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. I certainly haven't heard anything to do with the One Power. There was tampering going on, but we're talking more like Aes Sedai, things like that. The pillars that were left behind were obviously intended to do something, and the charges that were given to them....but it's not necessarily like they were trying to make anything specific.
