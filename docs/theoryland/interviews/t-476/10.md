# [Interview #476: TGS Signing Report - Robert Moreau, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=476#10)

#### Question

Can someone besides Rand be taught to see the black cords that are seen on other Forsaken?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan is kind of dodgy on the black cords. A lot of people tried to pin him down on those. I think that yes, others could be trained to see the black cords.
