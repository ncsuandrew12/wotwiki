# [Interview #476: TGS Signing Report - Robert Moreau, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=476#9)

#### Question

If someone were to use balefire as a weapon, could they redirect it through a gateway, or would it destroy the weave and keep going?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I happen to know that someone asked Robert Jordan this at a signing, and he gave a kind of glib answer that didn't answer anything. So, I'm going to RAFO that, and we'll see. There will be a lot of balefire in the future of these books. \*much laughter\*

#### Footnote

There was some conversation here about that answer, and someone who claimed to be at
[that signing](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=180#6)
, and that RJ pretty much told the person 'Go get laid.'
