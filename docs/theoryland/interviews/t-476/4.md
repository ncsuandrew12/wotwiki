# [Interview #476, Entry #4]: TGS Signing Report - Robert Moreau](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=476#4)

#### Question

Will we see Nynaeve Heal the darkness that is in some of the male channelers before the Cleansing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nynaeve has said before, and believes, that everything can and should be able to be Healed, except for maybe death, and she certainly believes that it is possible. I'm not going to say whether or not it will happen.

#### Footnote

Nynaeve Healed Naeff's madness in
*Towers of Midnight*
15, and spoke of Healing other Asha'man as well. Since RJ
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=75#11)
that the One Power can't be used to Heal insanity, this has led to some heated discussion. Those inclined to give Brandon the benefit of the doubt have suggested that what Nynaeve did wasn't technically Healing (she did specify that she didn't use Healing weaves).
