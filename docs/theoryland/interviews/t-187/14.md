#### Robert Jordan

A historical novel called
*The Fallon Blood*
, which was set during the American Revolution in the South. The state of South Carolina had approximately one quarter of all the battles, skirmishes and engagements fought in the American Revolution. It's been said of the colonies as a whole, a quarter of the people supported the revolution, a quarter of the people opposed it and the rest wished it would go away. That wasn't the case in the Carolinas and Georgia, where there was quite a bloody civil war fought between partisans for the two sides.
