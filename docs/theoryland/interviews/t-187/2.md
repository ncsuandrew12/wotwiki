#### Sci Fi Weekly

Why did you decide to write a prequel to the Wheel of Time series?

#### Robert Jordan

It's a complex answer, really. My publisher asked me to. I had written a novella for Robert Silverberg's anthology
*Legends*
. When I first sat down to do that novella, I had an idea of what I wanted to write and realized I could not put all the story I wanted to into that novella. It would be a novel.

I mentioned this to my publisher and he said, "Would you do the novel for me?" Since I had everything in my head already, it was a fairly quick write. It's not just an expansion of the novella. There's a lot more story and a lot of things that aren't hinted at in the novella.
