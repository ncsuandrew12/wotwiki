#### Sci Fi Weekly

The Wheel of Time series includes 11 books now, 10 novels and one prequel. How many more novels do you plan to write for the series? Are they going to be sequels or prequels?

The plan is to do a main sequence book—which I'm working on now, and then a prequel, then another main sequence book and another prequel.

I hope—please God, are you listening?—that there will be only two more books in the main sequence. When I started out, I thought it was only going to be five books. I thought I could fit the entire story into five books—maybe it might take six. When I finished
*The Eye of the World*
, I realized it was highly unlikely I'd be able to finish in six books.

The problem is, although I know what I want to happen, every time I begin a book, I realize I can't fit into that book everything I wanted to get into it. Some things had to be left over, to be taken up in another book.

I'm now at a point where I think I can see the end. For which I'm very grateful. It's been about 20 years of my life I've given to these books.
