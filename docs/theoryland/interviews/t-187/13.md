#### Sci Fi Weekly

You've written a number of Conan books. What aspects of the Conan adventures appealed to you, to get you involved in that project?

#### Robert Jordan

What got me involved in the project was a lot of bullying by my wife and my publisher, my wife being my editor. And at that time, she was also the senior vice president and editorial director of TOR Books.

I agreed to do one Conan novel—very reluctantly. I had a lot of fun doing it. I searched around to find some time in his life that hadn't been written about and settled on writing about him between the ages of 18 and 22. It is an age range where most young people think they have everything figured out. You know how the world works now and you are ready to take it on, and you are absolutely wrong—you don't know how anything works.

I had such fun doing that book, in a weak moment I agreed to do five more and a novelization of the second Conan movie [
*Conan the Destroyer*
]. By the end, I was glad to get out, to go back to writing my own stuff.
