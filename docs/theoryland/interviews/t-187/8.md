#### Sci Fi Weekly

Do you have another series planned after the World of Time ends?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, a much more compacted sequence of books. Set in a different universe, different world, different rules and different cultures. Nothing that will be reminiscent of
*The Eye of the World*
or The Wheel of Time at all. With the sole exception that one of the cultures is somewhat like Seanchan in the way it is, but a much different world.
