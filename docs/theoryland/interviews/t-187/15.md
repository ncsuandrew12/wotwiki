#### Sci Fi Weekly

You have loads of fansâ€”do any of them get a little carried away or become over-zealous sometimes?

#### Robert Jordan

Occasionally. But I haven't had anybody give me a freeze-dried cat or slit a wrist and ask me to autograph my book in blood. Both of those things happened to Clive Barker. Occasionally someone will get a little over-enthusiastic, but by and large fans are very nice people and very well behaved.
