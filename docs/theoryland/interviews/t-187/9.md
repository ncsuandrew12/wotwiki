#### Sci Fi Weekly

There is a lot of magic in your writing. Do you believe in any form of magic? How much of your spirituality is reflected in your writing?

#### Robert Jordan

No, I don't believe in magic, which is one of the reasons I structured the One Power very much as if it is a science. In fact, the technology of the preceding age was based on the use of the One Power.

As for how much of my spirituality is in my books, I leave it to anybody else to say whether I have any spirituality. I think I'm pretty grounded.
