#### Sci Fi Weekly

Is it harder to write a prequel or a sequel?

#### Robert Jordan

I think the prequel, because you don't want to give away things that come as a surprise in the main sequence books. You want to be a surprise as much as possible. That means you have constraints. I don't want to take away any of the "wow" factor from the main books for someone who has read
*New Spring*
first—that they can do, of course. You don't have to have read me before to read
*New Spring*
—which, I hasten to point out, is not the case of most of the books in the main sequence. With the main sequence books, you must start with
*The Eye of the World*
. If you picked up the latest book,
*Crossroads of Twilight*
—you'd read 10 pages, and if you hadn't read the books before, you'd quit from frustration. You wouldn't understand who these people are or what they are doing and why they are doing it.
