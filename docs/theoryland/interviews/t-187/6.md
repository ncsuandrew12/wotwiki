#### Sci Fi Weekly

How has the Wheel of Time series evolved from the first book,
*The Eye of the World*
, through subsequent novels?

#### Robert Jordan

It's a continuous story. I've known the last scene in the last book for about 20 years. I know exactly where I'm heading. I try to make each book better than the preceding books. I don't think you can say that it has evolved so much as grown in the direction I wanted it to grow.
