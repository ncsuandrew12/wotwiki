# [Interview #1000: Invisible Vanguard Author Interview: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1000#1)

#### Invisible Vanguard

Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy author who published his first book,
*Elantris*
, in 2005. Since then he has released several more successful books, including the Mistborn Trilogy, and
*The Way of Kings*
, the first part of an estimated ten-book series. In 2007 he was given the honor of completing the Wheel of Time series after the original author, Robert Jordan, passed away before its completion. Mr. Sanderson co-hosts a podcast at the website
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
, and teaches a creative writing class on fantasy and science fiction at Brigham Young University. Even with all that on his plate, he was gracious enough to set some time aside to answer a few questions for us regarding what psychs him out as a writer, how he plans to avoid "epic sprawl" and sagely advice for new writers trying to squeeze their way into the epic fantasy market.
