# [Interview #1053: Outline: The Eye of the World, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1053#4)

#### Robert Jordan

The story begins early in the morning, practically at first light, with Rand and Tam on their way to Emond's Field with two casks of Tam's pear brandy in their cart, and eight casks of his apple cider, good and hard after winter storing. These are to be delivered to the village tavern, for use during Spring Festival. Tam carries a spear and Rand his bow because there have been several recent attacks on men by wolves, bears and even boars. Rand sees a strange rider, seemingly a man in a hooded black cloak. He sees the rider at a distance, on the edge of some trees, but when he draws Tam's attention to him the rider has disappeared. Tam thinks it was imagination, but something about the figure disturbs Rand, a feel of ill intent and a sense that the rider was staring at
him.
