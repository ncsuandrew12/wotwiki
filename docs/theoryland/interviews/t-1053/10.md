One of the boys says his father says Warders are just stories for children, and the Blights and the Dark One are just tales to frighten fools. Some of the other boys begin to taunt this one. Rand feels a mounting anxiety, and some of the other boys seem to as well, but the first lad is finally taunted into actually saying Sha'tan's name. All of them, even the boy who said he didn't believe, feel a chill, as if things have gone further than they thought they would. Nyneve overhears the last part of this and is furious, reminding them that the Dark One can hear his name, that calling to him could bring him into the world again. Do they want to bring back the Time of Madness? The boys are all abashed.
