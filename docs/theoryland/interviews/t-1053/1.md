UPDATE: There are some ongoing discussions about what is okay to post in this database and what isn't. For now, this is all we will post, and it may be that we will have to delete even that. We apologize for any confusion.

This outline is with RJ's papers in the special collections of Addlestone Library at the College of Charleston, donated by Harriet McDougal in 2012 and processed by archivist Joshua Minor. Most of the material in the collection—especially drafts, galleys, unpublished fiction, and inaccessible floppy discs—will never be included in this database. These items can be accessed at the library with the exception of some time-restricted files which will not be available for many years. This specific file is Mss 0197, box 4, folder 2. The date of 1984 is approximate; it was written somewhere between 1984 and 1988.
