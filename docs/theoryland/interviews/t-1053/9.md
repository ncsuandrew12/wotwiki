All of the boys are fascinated by the strange man, but there is some argument among them considering him. They have seen armed men before, guards for the grain and wool buyers, but there is something different about this man. Someone suggests he is one of the supposed hooded men, but this is quickly laughed aaside [
*sic*
], for only Rand among them believes in the men. Some think he is a Warder, but all of the stories (the only way that any of them knows of Warders) places [
*sic*
] these fabulous warriors in the Northern Blight, or occasionally one of the other Blights, where they battle strange and deadly beasts and the evil of the Dark One. Besides, this man's weapons and armor are plain and well worn, while the Warders in the stories always have arms and armor decorated with gold and jewels.
