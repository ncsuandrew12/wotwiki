In Emond's Field we meet some of the village people. Nyneve Bayal, the Wisdom. Owyn al'Vere, the Mayor and tavernkeeper. Eguene, daughter of Owyn al'Vere and the girl Rand hopes to marry one day, though he isn't entirely sure how quickly he wants that day to come. Some of the village and farm boys with whom Rand is friends.
