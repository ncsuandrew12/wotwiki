## [Entry #1](./t-1045/1)

#### Res Ipsa

Is Noal a new hero?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Brandon said that he disagreed with RJ's views that a hero once bound could not be unbound. Brandon thought that since the WoT is infinite, eventually everyone would be bound.

#### Footnoteâ€”Terez

I had talked to Brandon about this before, noting that it was possible for heroes of the horn to die a permanent death, if killed after death while in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, same as the wolves. (See
*The Fires of Heaven*
Chapter 14, "Meetings".) I figured he had forgotten, so I emailed him after Res posted his report. This is his response to me:

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had completely forgotten that. So there IS an unbinding method. You just can't live through it.

For what it is worth, I am reasonably certain there is nothing in the notes about Noal being an old hero. [...] But maybe someone can find something in the notes at the [College of Charleston] library to be certain.

## [Entry #2](./t-1045/2)

#### Res Ipsa

Does a hero take on their most notorious form or their more recent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most Notorious. Brandon did not say this was confirmed from RJ but rather "how he viewed it."
