# [Interview #1045: WOR Signing Report - Res Ipsa, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1045#1)

#### Res Ipsa

Is Noal a new hero?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Brandon said that he disagreed with RJ's views that a hero once bound could not be unbound. Brandon thought that since the WoT is infinite, eventually everyone would be bound.

#### Footnoteâ€”Terez

I had talked to Brandon about this before, noting that it was possible for heroes of the horn to die a permanent death, if killed after death while in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, same as the wolves. (See
*The Fires of Heaven*
Chapter 14, "Meetings".) I figured he had forgotten, so I emailed him after Res posted his report. This is his response to me:

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had completely forgotten that. So there IS an unbinding method. You just can't live through it.

For what it is worth, I am reasonably certain there is nothing in the notes about Noal being an old hero. [...] But maybe someone can find something in the notes at the [College of Charleston] library to be certain.
