# [Interview #519: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Robert Jordan Memorial Scholarship applications, updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=519#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dan Wells and I recorded five episodes of the Writing Excuses at the recent CONduit convention, with the help of our friends at
[Dungeon Crawlers Radio](http://www.dungeoncrawlersradio.com/)
(since Producer Jordo was elsewhere and we are by no means audio recording experts). Howard Tayler was away at a different convention, so instead we were joined by a rotating crew of luminaries. First up were
[L.E. Modesitt](http://www.lemodesittjr.com/)
(of the Saga of Recluce and many others) and Dan's brother Robison Wells (whose book
*Variant*
comes out from Harper Teen in 2011). We recorded one episode on
[writing practical fantasy](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/05/30/)
and then recorded a Q&A episode where we covered
[military SF, action sequences, foil characters, time scheduling, and dialogue](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/06/06/)
. Check them out.
