#### Brandon Sanderson

We're closing in on the end of the Mistborn 3 annotations. Up first are the chapter 80 annotations that discuss
[Demoux's love life and testing the Mistfallen](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/356/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Eighty)
and
[the aftermath of the kandra Resolution](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/357/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Eighty-Part-2)
. Then comes the huge climax chapterâ€”and if you haven't read
*The Hero of Ages*
, please don't read these annotations, since they're full of spoilers! This one's a four-parter, and the first two parts cover
[prophecy and [redacted]](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/358/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Eighty-One)
and
[Human plus the trope of using the ultimate hidden weapon](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/359/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Eighty-One-Part-2)
. I hope you've enjoyed the last few years of Mistborn annotations, because they're almost done with. In three weeks they'll all be up, and then my assistant Peter will start queuing the
*Warbreaker*
annotations.
