#### Question

On Sel, it seems like a lot of the magic is tied in to the location on the planet. Could you take something like Soulforging and do it on another planet, or is it just tied into Sel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is tied into Sel, and there's this distinct reason for that, and it has to do with one of the big differences between the magic there and other places that people haven't picked out of me yet.

#### Question

So is that tied into how you can get Investiture there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. It's all tied in. Iâ€™ve only made it vaguely- It's not obvious, but I think you could pick it out if you worked at it.
