#### Question

What's your favorite board game outside of Magic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh... I'm not a board game guy. A lot of people who play Magic don't play anything else. My brother's the board game guy. I don't really have a favorite. I'll play with him, but I'll do it for fun to hang out with my family. If I do have one, it's Sorry, because that's what my family played when I was a kid. Does Dominion count? Then that would be my favorite. I really like Dominion. Stratego's not bad.
