#### Question

Are the 16 shards finalized?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have finalized them with the reservation that I can change them when I do their adaptation if something works better. I have them all written down, but they're not canonized. I could tweak them. Once I put them in a book, they're canonized. I like to give myself a little bit of flexibility before I put them in a book.
