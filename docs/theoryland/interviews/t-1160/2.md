# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#2)

#### Question

From Shadows of Self, you just sort of name Hoid. Is he just not caring anymore, or is it just space in the book? [If anyone wants to make sense of what this question is asking, feel free. I can't understand it.]

#### Brandon Sanderson

In Alloy, he wasn't really interested. He showed up only for a wedding. By this, he's noticed something else is happening on-world, so he's come back to investigate, but he's not really relevant. You will see him taking a larger role as he becomes more interested in what's happening on-planet. His level of involvement is kind of directly tied to how interested he is in what's going on.
