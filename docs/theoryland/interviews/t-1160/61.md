# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #61](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#61)

#### Question

About Renarin's Ssurgebinding. Are [his visions] they influenced by Voidbinding instead of Surgebinding? [unclear who "they" are-possibly his visions?]

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO.
Q: And then if they are influenced by Odium the way that Dalinar's are influenced by Honor.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO. I'm not going to talk about stuff like that! I have dropped some very blatant hints, and that is enough for me right now.

#### Argent

I asked pretty much the same thing last time, and you pointed me to a certain page. Can I tell her what the page was?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. There are certain things going on with him that I feel are very blatant. He [Argent] is going to point them out to you.
