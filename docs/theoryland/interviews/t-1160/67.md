#### Question

Is this how you envisioned Wax? [on the cover]

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's pretty close, yeah. [some time later] If there's one thing in the depictions of Wax that are a little wrong, I imagine him more swarthy. Darker coloring, just a bit. He's really kind of tannish. But I like how Ben got him to look kind of ugly, which is kind of Waxish. He's not horribly ugly, but he's not a model.
