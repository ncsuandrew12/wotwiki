# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #97](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#97)

#### Argent

Is the mist spirit in Alendi's logbooks the same as the one Vin sees?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Kurkistan

Is it the same one Elend sees?

#### Brandon Sanderson

When? (chuckles) No. It is not the same one that Elend sees. There is a different mist spirit back then. Elend sees the same one Vin sees.

#### Kurkistan

And Alendi saw a different one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. And originally my rules for what made a mist spirit were a little more lax than I eventually decided them to being.

#### Argent

But it still works…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What is in the books, it still works and is canonized, and those are two different mist spirits. But if you find the deleted scenes—if you look at them—there are- I am exploring more with mist spirits and you’ll find out what that would have been.
