# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#40)

#### Question

This is more of a nitty-gritty question about Allomancy, in particular cadmium. Would it function if it were affixed to a body smaller than a planet with its own source of gravity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What do you mean by work [function]?

#### Question

Like a spacecraft. My thinking is that it could be used on long space voyages, because youâ€™ve said that you're going to eventually progress into the Space age--

#### Brandon Sanderson

So are you asking if we can use that as cryogenics?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I actually give you some tools for figuring these sorts of things out in Bands of Mourning, so I'll refer you to that, because I'm dolling the physics of these things out, and since I know it's coming in January, just read that one. You'll get some more actual concrete laws and rules so you can start extrapolating.
