#### Question

What planet is Vasher from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He did originate on Nalthis, but he Worldhopped very early in his life.

#### Question

And what planet did he get the ability to change his shape, or is that because he's a Returned?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's because he's a Returned, yes.

#### Question

So it's not because he's a Lightweaver?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nope. That is a great question, though. He is mostly what he appears to be, with some hidden parts of his past.
