# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#25)

#### Question

Syl identifies herself as an honorspren.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Would Wyndle identify himself as a cultivation spren?
[Pause]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I think you could say that he would.

#### Question

By the same logic, would a voidspren follow the same naming convention, so to speak?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's the thing. Certain spren have decided that they are the most pure forms of honor, or that they are the most pure form of whatever, where all of them are kind of... Syl's got a good argument for what she is. But there are other spren that would be like "well, I'm an honorspren too, I'm just this variety of honorspren." Does that make sense? Syl's like "I'm an American!" and I'm like "I'm an Alaskan!" Yes, you're an American. I'm an American too. It's kind of similar to that. But she would be the most pure... many would view her as the purest form. Wyndle would view himself as the purest form of a cultivation spren.
