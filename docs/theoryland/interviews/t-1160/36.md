# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#36)

#### Question

Is metal a renewable resource on Scadrial, or is it going to run out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does run out.

#### Footnote

supposedly contradicts another WOB: I just got back from the Phoenix Comic on, where Brandon is a guest at, and I must say it was an honor to meet him. He read parts of Wax/Wayne 2, Legion 2, and the Taravangian interlude in WoR. There weren't a lot of cosmeric goodies, but I did get a couple interesting tidbits in relation to Mistborn: Ruin would have had to manifest to reabsorb the atium, the Well of Ascension did not come at a price to Preservation's power, and perhaps the most interesting one. Burned metals are turned into a different form, and will eventually return to the planet. The Pits of Hath sin are meant to foreshadow this.
