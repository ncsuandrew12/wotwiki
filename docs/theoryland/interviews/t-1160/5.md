#### Question

Are we going to get a 10th anniversary edition of Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's likely we will. The question is, how well does this one sell, and things like that, but the goal will eventually be to get a tenth anniversary, particularly for the ones where Peter didn't work with me yet, because when I hadn't hired him full time, we didn't get the Peter Copyedit, which is twenty times better than any other copy edit, so the typos were through the roof in some of the early ones, which is really why we needed the 10th anniversary copy.
