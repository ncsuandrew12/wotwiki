#### Question

Where are you going with the lunar allegory of Wax and Wayne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's no moon on Scadrial, and it just cracked me up that they would have these names that were a pun that they wouldn't get. I came up with Wayne's name first and then I needed a name for the straight man he played off of, and then Wax and Wayne amused me.
