#### Question

I have to congratulate whoever did the Soonie pup ad. Effective advertising: I want one!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, lots of people have said this. It was not something we were intending to do. It would have to be more than just a little puppy, though. You'd have to be able to rip out its spikes and transform it or something. You can go get a stuffed puppy anywhere.

#### Question

But it's a stuffed TenSoon, so it's a stuffed Irish wolfhound. And you can find those in adult. You cannot find those in puppy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'll think about it.

#### Question

You don't have to do the spikes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know, but people will want the spikes. You'd have to be able to take out the spikes and turn it into a blob, so it's a mistwraith on the inside and a Soonie pup on the outside.

#### Question

It'd have to be something like a backpack dog. Maybe the spikes are clasps on the outside or something.
