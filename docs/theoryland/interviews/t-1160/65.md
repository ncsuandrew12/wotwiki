# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#65)

#### Question

Allomancy is of Preservation, correct?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes...

#### Question

What are Feruchemy and Hemalurgy of?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hemalurgy is definitely of Ruin.

#### Question

Is it of pure Ruin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. That's a very Ruin thing. And Feruchemy is more of a blend. Though… there is more philosophy to that and human construct—like the Allomantic table—than I think I’ve made clear before.
