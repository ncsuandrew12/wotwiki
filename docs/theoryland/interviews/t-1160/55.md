# [Interview #1160, Entry #55]: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#55)

#### Question

We were talking about Kelsier, and how he was much more powerful than most Mistborn, and how Vin was slightly more than most Mistborn [I think this was supposed to be Kelsier?]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why were Vin and Kelsier more powerful?

#### Question

I know why Kelsier, but why Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vin was not more powerful. Vin just took to it very naturally. She was highly skilled. It was very instinctive to her, but Elend was actually more powerful than she was, if you count just raw power. Vin just knew her stuff. Beyond that Vin is a rare individual that for reasons I have not explained yet, was able to draw in the mists for a little extra boost at times. And there are other characters you have seen do this.
