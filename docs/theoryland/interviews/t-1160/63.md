# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #63](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#63)

#### Question

Is there going to be a Hoid series? Just Hoid?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There will be several Hoid books eventually. It will be about his backstory, the main one, and then we'll have some in the present as well.

#### Question

Will it show up in scenes where he interacts with these characters [presumably meaning, in scenes we already have seen him in, but from his viewpoint]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not planning those right now. I know they would be interesting, but I'm not sure if they'd make good enough books.
