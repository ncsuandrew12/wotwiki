#### Argent

Can somebody travel to the Spiritual Realm, the same as the Cognitive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it's a very different experience. It is possibleâ€¦ You may have seen people do it...

#### Argent

As in you're not sure, or you're being obnoxiously vague?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No...

#### Question

As in, you probably have but he's having trouble remembering it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No no no... For instance, Elend burning atium and duralumin pulled most of him into the Spiritual Realm.

#### Argent

Oh, that's what happens there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. He kind of got yanked into- You also have seen people ascend with the powers and dip into the Spiritual Realm for a little bit.

#### Argent

So, Vin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. But they could be on both, or either, or both at the same time. But you have seen Vin stick into the Spiritual Realm. And it happened to Sazed/Harmony...

#### Question

Oh! So is that where the gods live? Kinda?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most of the bulk of the Shard's energy of being is contained in the Spiritual Realm, yes. [edited for clarity- Original was: Most of the bulk of what the Shard's energy of being is contained on the Spiritual Realm] Except for one notable exception!

#### Question

The mistwraith? [I would guess she meant the mist spirit]

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.
