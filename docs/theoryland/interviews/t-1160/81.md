#### Kurkistan

If you spiked out Miles' Feruchemical gold, would he be able to burn his Allomantic reserves [read: Feruchemical reserves using Allomancy] and heal it back?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uhn... Okay. If you spiked out his ability to heal gold and somehow left him alive.

#### Kurkistan

Yeah, but still having Allomancy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Still has allomancy.

#### Kurkistan

And heâ€™s like in the middle of burning a goldmind.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that would still work. It'd still have a Spiritual connection to him.

#### Kurkistan

So if you're a Coinshot and you get [spiked] to have Feruchemical steel, and then you lose the spike after making a store, you can still Compound that for speed?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes... Yeah, that should still work.

#### Kurkistan

Was Paalm doing that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO.
