#### Argent

On Nalthis, can aluminum prevent somebody from Returning? So if you kill somebody with aluminum and leave the weapon in them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Long pause]I don't think that's going to be enough. I think that…

#### Question

Different way then?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah there are totally ways. I don’t think that that’s going to be enough. There's a difference between being inert and blocking Investiture, and actually sucking out Investiture. If you stuck Nightblood inside of a corpse; there are certain things… if you had a larkin or whatever sitting there that ingests the Investiture as it was coming in, that would prevent [Returning]. I think with aluminum you would just have somebody that comes alive with a wound, so maybe... But I think it would just heal around [the aluminum] and you'd just have a spike in you, kind of like Hemalurgy—but not like Hemalurgy. It's inert, but you know what I mean.

#### Question

Which suggests you can't actually Awaken aluminum.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It's not going to hold a charge.

#### Kurkistan

I assume you can't Forge it, either.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. In fact the unForgable metal-

#### Argent

Ralkalest?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's an unForgeable metal mentioned.

#### Kurkistan

Could we call it aluminum if we wanted to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Let's just say that aluminum through most cultures was considered a mythological metal, and when people could actually find some, they considered it more valuable than gold, in our culture. So just sayin’...
