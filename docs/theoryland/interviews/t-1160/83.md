#### Kurkistan

How long does it take a newly-made chair to start thinking of itself as a chair?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on how- is the perception of the people that are using it.

#### Kurkistan

So if it just drifted together in space magically into a chair...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. It would not actually start thinking of itself as a chair.

#### Argent

Kind of like if a tree falls in a forest, and there's nobody there to hear it...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
