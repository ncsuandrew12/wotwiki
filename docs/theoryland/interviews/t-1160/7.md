# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#7)

#### Question

Does the expansion of Jaddethâ€™s empire have more to do with greed and hunger for power, or the innate nature of Dominion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both. The innate nature of Dominion probably c0aused the greed and hunger for power.

#### Question

What would you say percentage-wise?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, one caused the other. It definitely started with Dominion. The Skaze are pretty thirsty for power.
