# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #70](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#70)

#### Question

The metals that were formed from Shards, like atium and lerasium. Are they somewhat naturally occurring, like in [?] of power, or are they specifically [?]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are somewhat naturally occurring.

#### Question

[Really? Even on other Shardworlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh. They could exist somewhere else. There are some special circumstances on Scadrial, but yes. The idea is that the pools are one state of this mythological matter.

#### Question

So if you have the physical state and the liquid state, is there a less liquid state? [what does this question even mean?] Because some of that's being used.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um... Oh. Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, it's such a drop in the bucket compared to the actual Shards. So that it is a statistically insignificant amount, but it is an amount.

#### Question

So Harmony's pool, wherever it is is statistically larger than...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
