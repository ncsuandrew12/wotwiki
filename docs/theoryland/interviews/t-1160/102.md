# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #102](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#102)

#### Question

In your mind, what would constitute a Worldhopper? Is it someone who makes a single trip between worlds (for example, the exodus from Yolen—not that it was an exodus, but a single trip), multiple trips between worlds (such as Hoid), or simply leaving a particular world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's the thing. I would call anyone who is aware that there are multiple worlds in the Cosmere and has visited more than one a Worldhopper.

#### Question

Do they actually have to have made it to a second world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think that…You’re getting at people like- I would say that they are a Worldhopper kind-of, but not fully. They’re kind of...

#### Kurkistan

The Doctor's companion?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the Doctor’s companion type thing. I would define a Worldhopper as someone who has been to another world. I would call someone who has not actually been to another world “Cosmere-aware,” but not necessarily a Worldhopper.

#### Question

I was thinking more along the lines of the Shard who does not have a planet.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Shards transcend these definitions.

#### Argent

They're kind of Worldhoppers by default.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
