# [Interview #1160, Entry #88]: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#88)

#### Question

If the spren that bond people scream when they touch a Shardblade, but then at the end of Words of Radiance Kaladin holds Szeth's honorblade and they do not have a problem with that, why does the Stormfather force Dalinar to get rid of his Honorblade at the end of Words of Radiance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So... He does not have an Honorblade at the end of Words of Radiance.

#### Question

He does not. Oh, I thought he got it from... [Taln]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that's what the assumption is. If you look very closely, the blade that you think he ends up with is described differently from the one that he actually does.
