# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #57](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#57)

#### Question

Why did you call it Shadows for Self?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are two answers to this. One is the kandra are kind of doing different versions of themselves. The other is that Wax is trying to decide which person he is, through this. The term "shadows of self" is actually a phrase that one of the kandra use in the first trilogy talking about this idea of changing who they are and things like that, so the phrase had import to me in-world.
