#### Argent

Since both the mists and Stormlight are very similar in many ways, are there gaseous, liquid, and solid states of Stormlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, but you know that there is a gas and a liquid.

#### Argent

The gas is just the stuff in the storms, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, and when it escapes from the gemstones.

#### Question

Isn’t there the lake?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The lake is liquid. So you know there’s two of the three already. So just sayin’...
