# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #85](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#85)

#### Question

I was curious if Nightblood was the only one of its kind, or if Vasher and Shashara have made any others.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO. Good question. Very good question. There was a point in time when Nightblood was the only one of its kind, and it may have continued until now.
