# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#10)

#### Question

For Soulforging, if you rewrite the history of an item, and it took effect permanently, would there ever be a potential to have a butterfly effect, out beyond the history of the item, that might directly affect something somewhere else in the world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It would be very very hard for that to ever happen, because it's like spliced DNA or something like that. It's not real. It's a Forgery. Nothing else considers it, that it did that. [That sentence is slightly unclear. Don't quote it.]. The only tricky bit would be if you have children, and you've rewritten yourself in an interesting way thatâ€™s actually changed your DNA, that... might have ramifications.
