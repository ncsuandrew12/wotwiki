# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #59](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#59)

#### Question

Would it be safe to assume that Kaladin is also carrying the Honorblade? Because that makes the most sense to me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which Honorblade?

#### Question

The one from Szeth.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is... He's not.

#### Question

That surprises me, because to me that would be the best- That would make the most sense.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That would be sneaky of me. But that's not the case.

#### Question

So he actually has an Honorblade, since you asked which one.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He took Szeth's. So he has that one. Oh! I thought you meant Taln's, I thought. He does not have Taln's. He has Szeth's.. Yes he has Szeth’s.

#### Question

I'm assuming he found that one, because that made the most sense to keep it safe

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s got Szeth’s, that is true. ... Sorry, I assumed you meant Taln's. Taln's is gone.

#### Question

Yeah. Taln's vanished off the face of the planet! I'm assuming Hoid grabbed that one, actually.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is one of the prevailing theories and not one that is unreasonable.

#### Question

Well, considering. That was the one, because you had mentioned last time you were here that you could have both, and I was like, "okay, so that means he’s got Szeth's sword."
