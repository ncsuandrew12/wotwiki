# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #62](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#62)

#### Question

Do the Knights Radiant have a nahn? Are they within the nahn system or the dahn system at all?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The nahn and dahn system is a more recent construct. They would be at the very height of it, I would say.

#### Question

Okay. So the system hasn't been reorganized yet with Kaladin and such?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll have to watch and see what happens in the next few books. Because the culture is not used to Knights Radiant being around.
