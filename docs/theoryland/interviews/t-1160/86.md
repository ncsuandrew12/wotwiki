# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #86](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#86)

#### Question

What was your inspiration for Spook?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Spook was based off of a goofy internet friend. My friends and I had made a forum online. Just my friends and I: Dan, and all these people that were writers. And then this random kid showed up, who was 16 and British, and started writing this weird stuff. He was like our little mascot, and he became our friend. We never knew him. It was all these graduated from college guys, and there's this sixteen year old kid that says the weirdest stuff.

#### Question

Does he know [that Spook's based on him]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, he knows. I told him 'I'm basing a character off of you'. He said, 'I'd love it.' And he turns out to be very heroic, so I'm sure that he... I mean, he read them all. He was great with it.
