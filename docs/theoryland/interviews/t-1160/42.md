#### Argent

Can you confirm: When Bleeder died, she only had one spike made of that new metal in her, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What does the book say?

#### Argent

It could go either way. Because it could be either one spike of the unknown metal and one regular, or just one of the unknown metal. And we're divided right now.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have heard this. I didn't intend you to get divided, but I've heard that you are, and part of me doesn't want theâ€¦ One Week Later...". I want more time for the theories to come out!
[You can hear the smile in his voice :( ]

#### Argent

There are theories.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know. Let's give the theories a little more time and then I'll canonize it for you in a little bit. I didn't intend for there to be a division here, but obviously there is, and so I'm going to wait until I'm done with tour. Then you can write to us and we'll tell you exactly what's going on there.
