#### Question

So some people were talking about your science fiction stuff, like Defending Elysium. Do you have any intention to go further with that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have no current intentions. I have ideas for where I would go, but I just have so many projects that right now I'm letting that one lay as is.
