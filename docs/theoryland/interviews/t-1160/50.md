#### Question

Is there a pattern to Spook's street slang?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it's a really loose one. It was based off of some rhyming slangs, some street slangs, and some things that I researched, where it would evolve day by day, and they would throw in some extraneous words just to confuse people that didn't speak it. It was also based on internet slang. There are rules, but the rules are kind of loose and free, and you can add weird words when you want to. You basically put everything in the past progressive and then you add lots of extra "to be" phrases. Then you reverse a few of your syntaxes, and that's it.

#### Question

So it's practicing a whole lot to sound improvised.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. ... Wasing the being of complicated to be. No, complicated to see. Yeah.
