#### Argent

The Hemalurgic constructs Bleeder uses. Do you have a name for them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have not named them yet. Should I? Is it important for fandom?

#### Argent

We don't know what to call them.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have in my head that they're kind of Hemalurgic chimaeras.

#### Argent

Okay. We'll go with that.
