#### Question

If an Allomancer ate a Forged metal, what happens?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is going to be some Investiture in that Forged metal, but it's not going to be keyed the right way, so it'd be like eating a metalmind... If you're asking if the metal was Forged into a different type of metal, the Forgery will take and it will believe and... that's going to get really weird. I have not considered that. That's a “let me think about it.” [Pause] My instincts say that it's going to work like the metal it's become long enough to burn for a few minutes, and then that's going to break the Forgery, and it's going to snap out of it and become the other metal. That’s my instinct, but I’ll have to think about it further.
(on second thoughts) It's going to be really hard to burn a metal that's Invested like that. The magics don't mix real well.

#### Kurkistan

Eh, you can burn metalminds.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, you can, but it’s from the same “magic set”, right? So...
