#### Alterodent

With Stormlight, the better the gem is cut, the less Stormlight it leaks, and the longer it holds its charge. If a gem was perfectly cut, on a molecular scale, would it leak Stormlight at all?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In a theoretical flawless gem, then no it would not.

#### Alterodent

Would it actually give off light?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ooh... Theoretically no it would not, but it's not what you're thinking...

#### Alterodent

No no no, that’s not what I’m thinking, I figured that’s something totally different.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, actually, it probably would still give off light, because it's drawing out of the Spiritual Realm. So I’d say it still lights, but it doesn't leak. The leaking is not where the illumination is coming from. The illumination is coming from a direct... It's basically a lightbulb screwed into the Spiritual Realm.
