#### Kurkistan

If you're on Threnody and you get withered by a shade, are you better off burning Allomantic aluminum, or tapping Feruchemical gold?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(lots of laughing) [Some clarification on the question]They would both work pretty well. I would say if you burned aluminum, that would kind of have the effect that you are wanting it to have, which is the effect- negating and sucking out, so thatâ€™s probably safer. But the gold would work, too.

#### Kurkistan

So would it be fair to describe withering as a kind of cancerous Forging-

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sure.

#### Kurkistan

That just kind of slowly takes over your soul?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sure. That's legit.
