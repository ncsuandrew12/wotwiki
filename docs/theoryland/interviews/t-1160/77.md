#### Alterodent

Can Hoid safely have an MRI?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Why do you ask that?

#### Alterodent

Because if you have metal inside your body, and you have an MRI, which is magnetic, it's very bad for you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're just assuming that... That's a very clever way to try to get around a question that I have not answered and intentionally said I am not going to answer, so...

#### Alterodent

Also, tattoos. You can't have a tattoo with an MRI. The ink has little bits of metal in it.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can't? Well, I assume there are tattoo inks that are not little bits of metal.

#### Alterodent

That's true.
