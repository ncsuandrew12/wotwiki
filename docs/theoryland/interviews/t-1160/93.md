# [Interview #1160: Shadows of Self-Oak Brook, IL, Entry #93](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1160#93)

#### Question

Could you Forge an entire human? What if a kandra eats that human?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, you could Forge an entire human, and the kandra can eat that human as long as the Forgery takes. The problem is, once you break the seal, they're going to change back. So that kandra would have to find a way to eat that person without breaking the Forgery. In that case it would just remain.
