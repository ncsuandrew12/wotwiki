Dear Les,

Things are going pretty well for me. I'm hard at work on
*Knife of Dreams*
, closing in on the finish. It will be good to get regular updates again. It would be good to get together during Dragon-Con, but as yet, I don't know what they will be having me do or when, so I can't make any commitments. Once I find out my schedule, things will shake out.

Take care, guys. All my best, Jim
