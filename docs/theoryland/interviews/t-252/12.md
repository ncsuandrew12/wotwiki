Dear Ernst,

Regarding the women, they are all right, but remember that the baggy trousers are garb of country women, not city women, who would wear dresses. For that matter, some country women will. Also, some of these women should have a short coat rather than a shawl.

The Kandori men are all right by and large, but the peasant looks too Medieval. Tell him to think more 1690-1700 AD.

By the way. Racelle looks just fine.

All my best, Jim
