# [Interview #882: AMOL Signing Report - Nygmus, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=882#2)

#### Nygmus

The real standout question for me was someone who asked if there was anything that Brandon found difficult or uncomfortable to write.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon talked about going into the outline, finding a couple things that made him go "Huh, that's interesting," (making specific mention of a certain conversation involving dresses and the color thereof), but the one that really stood out was "Oh, come on, you're going to make me write a spanking scene?"
