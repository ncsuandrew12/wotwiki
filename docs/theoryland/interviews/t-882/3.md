# [Interview #882: AMOL Signing Report - Nygmus, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=882#3)

#### Nygmus

After the signing and Q&A, I only stayed long enough to stop off at a trivia group and play until I earned one of the bumper stickers. I took "
*Tai'shar Malkier*
!", which isn't quite as cool as "
*Tai'shar Manetheren*
!" would have been, but still good.

Brandon, as always, was a pleasure to speak to. Took a moment to chat with him while he signed my books about how much I appreciated his work.
