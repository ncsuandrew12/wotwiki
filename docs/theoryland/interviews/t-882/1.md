# [Interview #882: AMOL Signing Report - Nygmus, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=882#1)

#### Nygmus

Couple of the questions asked that I can remember:

#### Harriet McDougal

I asked about the graphic novels, because I wasn't sure how far that project was going to go/how well-received it was for Harriet, but she seemed pleased enough with them. She said that there was a good team of people working on them and that they were working closely with Maria and Team Jordan.

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Brandon took a moment to point out that the bookstore also carried the graphic novels, and someone at the back found one on a shelf and held it up for demonstration.)
