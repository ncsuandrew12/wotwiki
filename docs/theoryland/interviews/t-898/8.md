# [Interview #898: The Arched Doorway: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=898#8)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And with
*A Memory of Light*
being finished, is it odd not having it to work on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is... It's very strange experience since it's been such a part of my life for so long, to not have it to work on... But I do intend to be a part of the fandom for the rest of my life. So, there is that.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

I know a lot of people are looking for it, and there will always be more theories. I do remember last year when I spoke with you, you did say there will be loose ends, so people will be theorizing on those for a while.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, there will be loose ends, and I can talk to that when the book comes out.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Alrighty then! You'll just have to come back to Toronto then.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, well that's a deal then.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Alright, I think thatâ€™s it... Thank you!
