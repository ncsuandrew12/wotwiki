# [Interview #898, Entry #5]: The Arched Doorway: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=898#5)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Okay, so can Darkfriends or maybe even Forsaken be bound to the Horn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Let's see if I can answer this one... They're not going to be, I don't think there's a law against... But only the greatest heroes are bound to the Horn. They are not the greatest heroes. So, why are you asking this?

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Iâ€™m pretty much asking about Verin, and the likelihood of her being bound.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, I don't know that there would be anything forbidding Verin from being bound to the Horn.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Is there any mention of that in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a RAFO.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Alright, thank you though...
