#### Rebecca Lovatt

This past weekend I was at the
[World Fantasy Convention](http://www.fact.org/wfc2006/)
in Toronto, and
[Brandon Sanderson](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/)
, author of the Mistborn series,
*The Way of Kings*
, and co-authored the last books in the
[Wheel of Time series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time)
was kind enough to let interview him earlier today.

**Slight spoiler warning for
*Towers of Midnight***
