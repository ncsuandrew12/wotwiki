#### Rebecca Lovatt

Mat Cauthon's foxhead medallion is described as having only one eye, and that's in the shape of the ancient symbol for Aes Sedai. Was this foreshadowing the events that happened the Mat in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe it was probably foreshadowing. Jim knew since book one what was going to happen, so I would say yes. My instincts say yes, but there's nothing in his notes which said so one way or another. I've always felt that it was.
