# [Interview #898: The Arched Doorway: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=898#7)

Okay, and, next year, we're getting Stormlight Archive book 2? Or will that be early 2014?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It should be Christmas 2013; that's what we're aiming for. In fact, I have to name it this weekend so TOR can start the publicity for it.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And then we're also getting
*A Memory of Light*
, obviously, and
*The Rithmatist*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that's the book I wrote just before Wheel of Time in 2007, back before I was offered a Wheel of Time offer...and it languished for years because I was so busy with Wheel of Time—and when I had any free time,
*The Way of Kings*
—I wasn't even able to do revisions. The three or four months it would have taken would have slowed down one of those two books, so I was able to take those months after
*A Memory of Light*
was done.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

And is there anything next year?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't know when
*Steelheart*
will be out, but probably 2014...but it is on people's radars. This is another one before I took up before Wheel of Time, but I wrote it in gaps between books, so people know about it. I've been trying to shop it Hollywood for years, but I was finally able to polish it off and sell it. Once Wheel a Time was done I was finally able to spend time on these things which have been put aside for years. Things like this are good, but to give them the time to make them great while I was working on them would have taken time away from
*A Memory of Light*
, and it wouldn't have been right to let them demand that time, so it wasn't until recently that I've been able to give them that time. So, I think that'll be 2014, but we do get three books next year most likely.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Yep, and that's great... I'm looking forward to reading them all.
