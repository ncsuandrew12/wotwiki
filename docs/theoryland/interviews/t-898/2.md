# [Interview #898, Entry #2]: The Arched Doorway: Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=898#2)

#### Rebecca Lovatt

So... Hoid. We see him in almost all of your books, though I don’t think I saw him in
*The Emperor's Soul*
...

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's referenced in
*The Emperor’s Soul*
, but he got cut from the book. I actually wrote the scene with him in it, but it didn't fit so we had to cut it.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Are we ever going to get his origin story, or learn more about him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, we definitely will learn more about him. A book that has more of him is
*Dragonsteel*
, which I wrote when I was undergraduate as my honors thesis. It's not his origin story, but it's one he's mostly part of. We will find out everything, and get the complete story for him. It will happen eventually.

#### Rebecca Lovatt

Well, I look forward to reading more about him... He's an interesting character.
