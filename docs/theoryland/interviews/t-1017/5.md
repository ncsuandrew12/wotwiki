# [Interview #1017: Talking With Tom: A Conversation Between Tom Doherty and Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1017#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I remember those little half books of
*The Eye of the World*
. I was already a fan by then, but those became collectors' items among the fans.

#### Tom Doherty

We gave away over a million of them. I figured anybody who read that couldn't stop.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow. A million of them? Really. That's a lot.

#### Tom Doherty

It was. It wasn't quite half of the novel. It was a natural break that Harriet agreed on.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It was Shadar Logoth, I seem to recall. Wow. A million. That's crazy. I mean, most authors don't have a million books in print, and Robert Jordan had a million of his promo books in print. That's just crazy. You did that right around the third book, wasn't it?

#### Tom Doherty

Yeah. The first book sold 40,000 trade paperbacks. We launched it as a trade paperback, because not many people were doing major promotions on trade paperbacks in those days. We ended up selling 40,000 of the trade.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which is really good.

#### Tom Doherty

Which was very good, yeah. I had the hardest time with the sales force when, on the third book, I wanted to make the major promotion in hardcover. They said, "Well, you've got such a winner. Why would you want to change?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

See, as a reader, when I picked up
*The Eye of the World*
, I picked it up in mass market paperback. My bookstore first got it in mass market. I was just a new reader, and all the books that I had read up to that point had been series in progress that people handed to me, like David Eddings. Fantastic stuff, particularly for a teen boy. And Tad Williams, and Terry Brooks. I found the Dragonriders on my own and loved those, but it was already done. I was on the lookout for something to discover then. I didn't want to always just be handed something that everyone else loves. "Where's my series?"

When I saw
*The Eye of the World*
, I was on the lookout for big, thick books, because you got more bang for your buck. As a kid who didn't have a lot of pocket change, that was an important thing. So I bought
*The Eye of the World*
, and I read it, and I said, "There's something really special here. I think this is going to be mine."

Then my bookstore got the second one in trade paperback, and I said, "A‑ha! I've spotted it!" Because as a kid, that told me that this book was popular enough that my little bookstore was willing to order in the trade paperback. Then, when the third one came out in hardcover, I thought "He's made it, and I called it." I was like the Wheel of Time hipster, right? "From the get‑go, this is my series and I found it, and all you other people didn't see it in the beginning." Even still, I'll go on signings and ask, "Who picked it up in 1990?" and we'll get a cheer for those of us who waited 23 years for the series to end.

#### Tom Doherty

That's great.
