# [Interview #1017: Talking With Tom: A Conversation Between Tom Doherty and Brandon Sanderson, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1017#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The first Tor book I read, probably like a lot of readers, was
*Ender's Game*
. That was also the first time I knew that Tor was a thing.

#### Tom Doherty

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I read
*Ender's Game*
right after I became a fantasy and science fiction reader. It was right in that early day, before
*The Eye of the World*
was even out. And now we finally have the movie. This has been going on forever, right?

I remember back in the 90s, when I hadn't been published yet, writing books but still super fan boy, that one of my friends had an
*Ender's Game*
movie script. I don’t even know if it was the real script, but it passed around from hand to hand. We were all like, "We've read the script for the
*Ender's Game*
movie!" Now it’s fifteen years later, and it must have been just wildly different.
