# [Interview #1017: Talking With Tom: A Conversation Between Tom Doherty and Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1017#6)

#### Brandon Sanderson

When I started wanting to get published and was sending books out, there were really only two publishers I was sending to. One was you, as Robert Jordan's publisher, and the other one was Daw, because I really liked how Daw handled... Well, to be honest, I sent to them because they got Michael Whelan covers a lot, and I liked Michael Whelan covers.

When Moshe [Feder, Sanderson's editor] finally called me, my agent wanted me to negotiate and take it to other publishers to see who would offer more. I wouldn't let him, because I thought, "Once you're at Tor, you don't go anywhere else. You go with Tor. Once you're at the fancy French restaurant, you don't go down and see if there's a better deal at McDonald's. Maybe there will be, but you end up with McDonald's instead of the fancy nice restaurant. Instead of getting a steak, you end up with a burger." I already had the steak, so I went with Tor.

And now, sitting in this room... The readers can't see this, but we're in the prow of the Flatiron Building. It's one of the most famous buildings in the city. This was the Daily Bugle, right?

#### Tom Doherty

Yep.

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you go watch the Spiderman movies, you can see. I'll always be like, "There's Tom's office." I'm right at the tip of it, just looking out at the city. It's the coolest office I've ever been in.

#### Tom Doherty

They tell me it got trashed in
*Godzilla*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Godzilla reached in the window and pulled something out.

#### Tom Doherty

Apparently they shot some rocket at him. [Note:

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's looking remarkably well put together for having been blown up.
