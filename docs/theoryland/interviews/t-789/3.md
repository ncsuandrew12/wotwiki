# [Interview #789: TOM Signing Report - Eformo, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=789#3)

#### Eformo

#### Brandon Sanderson

I got a more circumspect RAFO when I asked whether or not he personally thinks of Rand as Rand after the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
, or if he now thinks of the amalgam as a different character. He thought that it would be apparent after reading the POV in both
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
.
