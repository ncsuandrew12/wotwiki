# [Interview #789: TOM Signing Report - Eformo, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=789#4)

#### Eformo

A little unexpected nugget of fun was the fact that Bob Kluttz joined Brandon and Harriet on the dais. I think I caught him a little off-guard when I asked him to personalize his autograph in my book! I asked him to sign, "your personal Aelfinn," since I've gotten WAY more than three questions answered, many of which even touched on the Shadow!
