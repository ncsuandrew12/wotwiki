# [Interview #707: Alloy of Law Signing Report - zxg15, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=707#1)

#### zxg15

First time poster, long time lurker. I was very excited when Brandon announced that he was coming to Vancouver, since I've wanted to see him in person since I started reading his books about 3 years ago. I figured I would share what I think is new info from the signing.
