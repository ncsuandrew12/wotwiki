#### zxg15

Asked him for more info on what he meant when he said that Stormlight will be organized as two 5-book series within the total 10 books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Understandably he didn't want to give much away, he wouldn't say if there would be a time skip or not. He did tell me that there would be a large change in tone between books 1-5 and 6-10. Also, he said that since book 2 is now going to be Shallan's, he wants Dalinar's book to be number 5. He then talked about how the 5 characters that were introduced in depth in
*Way of Kings*
would be the the 5 flashback characters for the first 5 books and the others would be more focused on in the final 5 books.
