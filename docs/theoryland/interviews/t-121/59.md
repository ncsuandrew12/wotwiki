#### Meg Young from Florida

In a previous question you stated that it took you so long to write
*The Eye of the World*
because you realized a number of things you hadn't yet researched. What sort of things were these, and how did you survive the more tedious aspects of world-building (i.e., lists of government official names, lists of cities and their major imports and exports, etc.)?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, the tedious bits were quite easy, and it wasn't so much a matter of research I hadn't done as things that needed to be worked outâ€”which I thought could wait until later because they were not going to come into the books until later. But I realized once I began writing that I had to realize how those things worked and fit together NOW, because that would affect how things happened in that first book.
