#### Juris Koren from Sigil

When you started writing WoT—or even after the first couple of books were published—did you ever expect the public reaction that WoT has received? All the popularity and fanfare and such? Or were you just sort-of writing for you and if it was well-received, fine; if not, fine?

#### Robert Jordan

I was writing for myself. I never expected any of this.
