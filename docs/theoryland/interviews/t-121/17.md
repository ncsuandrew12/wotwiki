#### Liandra from The Netherlands

I understand there would be a person in
*The Eye of the World*
, but that he was cut out or something. Who was he?

#### Robert Jordan

One of the characters who I have brought in later was a fellow named Daniell in
*The Eye of the World*
, and I brought him out because I realized he didn't have anything to do there. I reintroduced him later. At that point, he was simply taking up space.

#### Footnote

There was a detailed
[conversation with Brandon](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#11)
on this subject during his re-read of 2011.
