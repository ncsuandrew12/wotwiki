#### Andrew Wilson from Toronto, Canada

Out of all the 'evil' characters you've created in the eight, now nine books of the Wheel of Time series, which character is the most dangerous to Rand?

Hmmm. Actually, I think the most dangerous character to Rand is Randâ€”but among the others, each of them has their own particular danger toward Rand.
