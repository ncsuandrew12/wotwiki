#### Bela the Horse from Tel'aran'rhiod

What was the "extra bit" in
*The Path of Daggers*
? Was it the kiss or the bonding? Please help settle this long-standing dispute.

#### Robert Jordan

The kiss is necessary, because that's how they learned to do it, because that's how the fellow that developed it did it. The extra bit is something in the bonding, and you'll find out what in
*Winter's Heart*
. You should have gotten a clue, I think, in the scene where the bonding took place.
