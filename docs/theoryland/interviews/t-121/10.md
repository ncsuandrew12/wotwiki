#### Rune from Dragonmount

Do you have a Languages education? Where did you get the idea for the Old Tongue?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I got the idea for the Old Tongue simply because the core beginnings of this story lie 3000 years in the pastâ€”and I've never heard of a language remaining unchanged over that length of time. We could not understand the English spoken by an Englishman from 1000 years ago, and we'd have difficulty understanding him from 500 years ago, and the same holds true for a Frenchman with his language or a German with his.
