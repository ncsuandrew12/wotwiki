#### Missy from Oregon

Do the portrayals of the people on the covers match what you think they look like?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes and no. It's very hard to get an artist to portray someone just as you see them. If I were an artist, perhaps the covers would show the people EXACTLY as I see them. But since I'm not, we have to make do with me giving descriptions to the artist.
