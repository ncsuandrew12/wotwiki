#### Joseph Etcheto from Southbury, CT

Hello again Mr. Jordan. Not that I'm looking forward to the end, in the sense of it being over, but what are your plans, if any, after you have finished this series? Will you continue telling stories about this world, or will you move on to new things?

#### Robert Jordan

I intend to move on to new things. I have been thinking about another fantasy series, another world, another set of cultures, for about, oh, it must be six years now it's been percolating around in the back of my head.
