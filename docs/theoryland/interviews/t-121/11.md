#### Candice from Greenville, North Carolina

Do you ever feel under a lot of pressure to finish the books due to their popularity?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, sometimes. But I know where I'm going, I know how I want to finish it, I do not intend to speed up the pace to get there faster. In truth, the greatest pressure to finish it, I think, comes from ME. I won't really have done it until I finish it.
