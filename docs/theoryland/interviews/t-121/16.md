#### Jan from Colorado

In
*The Great Hunt*
it was mentioned that an Aes Sedai with gray hair was very old indeed. How old does an Aes Sedai typically have to be for her hair to start turning gray?

#### Robert Jordan

It varies. But usually they would expect to have grey hair by oh, 200 years of age. Some grey hair at least. Just like anyone else, some have grey hair at 150, or even 100, but that would be considered prematurely grey for an Aes Sedai.
