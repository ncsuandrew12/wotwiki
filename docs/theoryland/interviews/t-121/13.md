#### Richard from Kentucky

In fantasy, the epic battle between good and evil is a physical battle. How do you personally cope with experiencing the world of WOT, and having to face the real world? Also, are you like C.S. Lewis in that you can't believe in the world you created, seeing as you made it? Thank you.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I suppose I believe in the world I made as much as any writer believes in the world he or she createsâ€”I can see it, feel it, smell it. But I certainly have no difficulties stepping outside the world in my head into the REAL world.
