# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #47](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#47)

#### David Burke from Northeastern University

Thank you so much Mr. Jordan for writing this series. It has entertained me for a very long time. My question is: If you were to be a member of a group or society represented in your books, which would it be? I think that I would like to be an Ogier because of their simple and peaceful way of life.

#### Robert Jordan

I don't know that I would particularly like to be a part of any of the societies or organizations or groups that I have described. I suppose if I had to choose, it would be a toss-up between being an Asha'man and being a Warder.
