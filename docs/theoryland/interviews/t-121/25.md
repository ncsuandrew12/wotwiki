#### Henrik from Tampere, Finland

Mr. Jordan, what is your stance on uncommissioned fan illustrations depicting the world you've created?

#### Robert Jordan

I really don't have a stance. I know a lot of people do fan art of one sort or another. As long as no one is trying to make money on my creations, it's all right with me!
