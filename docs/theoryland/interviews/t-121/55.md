# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#55)

#### Kevin from Dallas, Tx

Just want to say I really love the books. I am currently rereading them before I read
*Winter's Heart*
. I hope I don't break down and read
*Winter's Heart*
before I have reread the whole series. It always keeps the sub plots in mind. Now the question. Do you have anybody that reads the book that you are currently working on to make sure that the main plots and subplots are intact and that things have not been left out or added too soon?

#### Robert Jordan

That's me!
