#### William Barbarow from California

Hi, Mr. Jordan, I have been an avid reader of your books since I first read
*The Eye of the World*
about a year ago. I was wondering how did you choose the colors for the Ajahs; i.e., why are some colors such as orange left out and gray is in? Thanks for answering my question.

#### Robert Jordan

I stuck with what you might call basic colors, and orange is not a basic color.
