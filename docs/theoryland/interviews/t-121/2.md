#### James Koziol from Melbourne, Australia

Dear Mr. Jordan: Could you please give finally "reveal all" about who killed Asmodean at the end of the fifth book of your series? Much speculation has been bandied about, and you have said yourself you have given us enough clues, so could you put said speculation to rest? Thanks for your great series, it's been a really good read so far!

#### Robert Jordan

No. I will not put the speculation to rest! I'm rather entertained by the speculation, actually.
