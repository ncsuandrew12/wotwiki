#### Baroc from Dragonmount

Do you have any special fan activities planned for DragonCon next year? Thank you.

#### Robert Jordan

No, to the best of my knowledge, I have not agreed to be at DragonCon next year! I have to point out that in the last few years, there seems to be a rash of people convincing world fantasy conventions, world science fiction conventions, that they are ME, and they have arranged panels that I knew nothing about until I received a schedule from the convention saying that these were the panels I was on.
