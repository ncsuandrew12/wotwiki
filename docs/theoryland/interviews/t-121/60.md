# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#60)

#### John Miller from Virginia

First off thanks for joining us on the chat. To settle a dispute on our mailing list I would like to know if the
*gholam*
works the same way as Mat's medallion? Can it be killed by lightning or any such thing?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out. The principle is the same, but it doesn't work in the same way as Mat's medallion.
