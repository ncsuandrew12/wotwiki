# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#12)

#### MD Young from Plano, TX

In the chat before
*The Path of Daggers*
, you said that you felt three more books were needed to complete the series. Are we down to two more books now, or has the series been pushed back to another book?

#### Robert Jordan

It still sits at three more books to finish, but I've always said from the time I began using the three books that it would be AT LEAST three booksâ€”that I'd try to finish in at least three books, but I couldn't promise. I know that I couldn't possibly finish in fewer than three. If I can finish in three, I will. But that's what I'm hoping for, what I'm trying for. NOT a promise.
