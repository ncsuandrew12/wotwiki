# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #53](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#53)

#### Eric from Cleveland

Mr. Jordan, do you have to reread your books often in order to remind yourself of everything you have done and still need to do, or do you just look back at notes as a basic reminder? Thanks.

#### Robert Jordan

Sometimes I have to look back at the books themselves, but primarily that is to make sure that I remember for example, exactly what someone said to someone else, I don't need to remind myself of the story or what has happened. I sometimes do have to check on small details.
