#### David from Austin

When will the Land of Madmen (as shown in the Guide) come into play, and are you considering ever making a second edition of the Guide?

#### Robert Jordan

As for when or if it will come into play, read and find out. As for another edition of the guide, I would like to do a concordance or encyclopedia when the cycle is finished, but I have no plans before that.
