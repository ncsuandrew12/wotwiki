#### Travis (Mangneth) from North Texas

Will Sharina play a more prominent role in
*Winter's Heart*
? How big of a role will she play in books to come? Will we learn more about her, like her past, thoughts, feelings, etc.?

#### Robert Jordan

We'll certainly see her againâ€”for the rest, read and find out. If I tell you everything that's coming, and everything that isn't coming, you're going to lose interest, aren't you?
