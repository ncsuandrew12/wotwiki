# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#64)

#### Dave from Wautoma, WI

Thanks for such a terrific series! I can't begin to tell you how many hours of entertainment it's provided. I was just wondering . . . provided that you get the time once in awhile, do you tend to read books inside the fantasy genre or outside or it?

#### Robert Jordan

I read more outside of the fantasy genre than inside, but I certainly do read fantasy.
