# [Interview #121: Barnes and Noble Chat, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=121#37)

#### Rick from Medford, NY

Mr. Jordan, does it ever frighten you that people ask you the most detailed questions about your series, kind of like Star Trek fanatics do with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy?

#### Robert Jordan

No, that doesn't worry me or frighten me. The only times I get worried are when people seem to believe that I am some sort of guru, and I'm notâ€”I'm a storyteller. I write books, that's it. I tell stories.
