#### Brandon Fincher from Abilene, TX

Mr. Jordanâ€”What rough percentage is devoted to Mat and Perrin in this book? I must admit I was disappointed Mat wasn't in
*The Path of Daggers*
more.

#### Robert Jordan

In
*The Path of Daggers*
, you have to remember that Mat had a building fall on top of him. I personally don't think that Mat lying around in a bed with bandages and splints is very entertaining, and it certainly wouldn't have done anything to advance the story. Mat does have an encounter with pink ribbons that some of you might find amusing in this book.
