#### Erik Hovda from Monterey, CA

I have heard of some authors writing themselves as a character in their books. Have you intentionally done that or perhaps see yourself in one of your characters? For example, Loial is taking notes so that he may write a book about Rand and the events surrounding him. Is he perhaps the "closest fit" to someone who embodies you for the series?

#### Robert Jordan

According to my wife, he isâ€”but I don't think so.
