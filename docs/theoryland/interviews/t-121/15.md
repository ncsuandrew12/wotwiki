Mr. Jordan, I love your books. If a person begins to channel at an old age, e.g. Sharina, will she begin to physically look younger when she slows, or will she remain the same and pick up from there?

#### Robert Jordan

She remains the same. It's not the same as having been stilled or burnt out. She's going to have a very long life, still, just not as a youthful person.

#### Footnote

RJ said

that she will indeed grow younger in appearance.
