#### Jennifer from BarnesandNoble.com

On behalf of a promotion that BarnesandNoble.com is conducting, I'd like to ask: what are your favorite books, and why?

I can't give favorite books, but I can give my favorite authors: John D. MacDonald, Jane Austen, Robert Heinlein, Louis L'Amour, Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain.
