#### Kelly van der Laan from The Netherlands

Man, I'm so lucky I couldn't sleep! (It's 1 am here) RJ, I loved
*Winter's Heart*
and especially the last chapter! Could you please put some more of the Forsaken POV's in the next book, most of all Cyndane and Graendal? I love those two!

#### Robert Jordan

Well, it's possibleâ€”but how have you read
*Winter's Heart*
already? It doesn't go on sale until tomorrow! If it's been sold anywhere, it's a shock to me!

#### Footnote

There are always some copies that hit the shelves too early somewhere, and it's more common in European countries and at independent bookstores in the US where the US publishers have less influence.
