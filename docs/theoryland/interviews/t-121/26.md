#### Ryan from New Orleans

What is the average term of office for the average Amyrlin, assuming she isn't deposed?

#### Robert Jordan

If you check the list of Amyrlins in the illustrated guide, which covers about 1000 years prior to the story, you'll find that there's quite a wide variationâ€”up to 50 or 60 years for some, and for others, perhaps 20. In large part, it depends how old she was when she was chosen Amyrlin. That is, given that she wasn't deposed.
