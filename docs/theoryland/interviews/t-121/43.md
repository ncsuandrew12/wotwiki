#### Jiri Kristek from The Czech Rep.

Mr. Jordan How many hours per day do you approximately spend writing, and do you listen to music meanwhile or do you prefer the silence?

#### Robert Jordan

I usually write to classical music of various kinds, and occasionally Chinese or Japanese music. I like to listen to rock and to jazz, but I can't write to them. As for the number of hours, I try to do at least eight hours a day, six or seven days a week. When the schedule gets very hectic, that can grow to twelve hours a day seven days a week, and no time off.
