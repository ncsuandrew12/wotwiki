#### Emily from San Jose

If you could choose any one element from your series to bring into the 'real world', what would it be? Use of the One Power?
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
? Something else?

#### Robert Jordan

I don't think that I would bring anything from my world into the real world. They're all very wonderful things, I believe, but taken all in all, they make the world much too interesting for comfort. And the world we live in is awfully darned interesting, and sometimes awfully uncomfortable, as it is.
