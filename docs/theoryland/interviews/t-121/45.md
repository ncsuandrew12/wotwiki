#### Emily from San Jose

If you could choose any one element from your series to bring into the 'real world', what would it be? Use of the One Power?
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
? Something else?

#### Robert Jordan

And the world we live in is awfully darned interesting, and sometimes awfully uncomfortable, as it is.
