# [Interview #49: LOC Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=49#9)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked if he had anything he wanted to pass on to the net as a whole, and he responded, "50% of the FAQ (pre-
*The Fires of Heaven*
) is wrong."

He wants a copy of the latest FAQ, which I presume can wait until we can incorporate the primary points from
*Lord of Chaos*
into it. PNH, can we send that through you or through some other medium?

He likes Mexican food and treats his driver well. ;)
