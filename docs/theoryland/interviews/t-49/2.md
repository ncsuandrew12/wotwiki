# [Interview #49: LOC Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=49#2)

#### Robert Jordan

He is aware of us, and the Bela discussion. We had a rather long convoluted discussion about Bela and the Darkfriend social, which seemed to leave everyone else clueless, when I identified myself as a net.jordanite...

We complain about the Sweet covers. He complains about the German covers. (Well, not much. But one in particular had a naked woman wearing pearls holding back an army with a wave of her hand (
*The Great Hunt*
) and "I had no idea where they got that one.")

You don't want to hear about his British agent.
