# [Interview #49, Entry #5]: LOC Signing Report - Matthew Hunter](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=49#5)

#### Question

About Aes Sedai and their oaths:

#### Robert Jordan

"Rand is in control, one way or the otherâ€”depending on exact oaths, who was Black Ajah, and how willing they are to hold to those oaths."

#### MATTHEW HUNTER

Given that most were from Arafel, where they have 'strange ideas about honor', and the first clause in that sentence, I'd say that the non-Black Aes Sedai who swore will be inclined to support him (mostly) honestly.
