#### herid

I also asked him if the character of Verin had any mythological parallels.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that he doesn't know and would have to see if there is anything in the notes. He also said that most of that stuff was done by RJ but he did add some of his own. He specifically mentioned that Perrin getting wounded in the leg in
*Towers of Midnight*
was his own addition. He didn't elaborate but there are a number of deities (particularly blacksmiths of some sort) like Vulcan and Perun who were wounded in the leg.

#### Footnote

Verin is derived from
[Verin or Verrine](http://www.hellhorror.com/demons/demonology/469/Verin.html)
, the demon of impatience.
