# [Interview #844: Toronto Signing Report - herid, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=844#5)

#### herid

I also asked him if the Heroes of the Horn are invulnerable when they are called by the Horn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was very ready for this questionâ€”when I started to explain that Birgitte told Nynaeve something along those lines in
*The Shadow Rising*
he said that he knows the quote I mean and then he said this. Firstly, the Heroes when called by the Horn are not completely invulnerable. But he specifically said that he is not saying that one of them will die. Rather, he said that the issue will be addressed in a discussion between two characters in the book.

#### herid

I found this to be a very interesting answer. I think it puts a serious crimp on the theories that Rand will die and come back to fight the Dark One as a Hero of the Horn.
