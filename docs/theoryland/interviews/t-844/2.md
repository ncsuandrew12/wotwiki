# [Interview #844: Toronto Signing Report - herid, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=844#2)

#### Question

Somebody asked if he killed any characters against RJ's wishes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that there was one character who he was going to let live but Harriet insisted should die. And there was another character whose fate was not spelled out in the notes (I didn't quite hear what he said there) and that he killed that character himself. Other than that everybody who dies, dies by RJ's hand. I think he talked about this in other interviews so this is probably not new.
