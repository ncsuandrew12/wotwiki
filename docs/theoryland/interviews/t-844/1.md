# [Interview #844, Entry #1]: Toronto Signing Report - herid](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=844#1)

#### herid

I just came back from a book signing by BS at Chapters here in Toronto and I wanted to relate a few tidbits.

It started with about a half hour Q&A which unfortunately I missed
**completely**
because of absolutely horrendous traffic in downtown Toronto.

I did get to ask him a couple of questions when he was signing books and I also heard a couple of questions by other people in line and I want to share those.
