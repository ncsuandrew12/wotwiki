# [Interview #844: Toronto Signing Report - herid, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=844#4)

#### herid

I asked him if there is a time limit on how long the Dark One can hold the souls he grabs.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that he is not sure and might have to consult the notes but he thinks that there is a time limit.

#### herid

I think that should put an end to the theories that the Dark One has been holding any souls for hundreds or even thousands of years.
