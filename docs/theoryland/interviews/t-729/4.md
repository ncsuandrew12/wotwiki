# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#4)

#### Aidan Moher

Stand-alone novels are a rare occurrence is the Fantasy genre, an area of literature that is typically filled with epic, multi-book series. What prompted you to begin your writing career with a stand-alone,
*Elantris*
and why the change to a trilogy with Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Two things influenced my decision to write
*Elantris*
as a stand-alone novel. The first is the aspect that as a new author, I didn't have a proven track record. I'd grown a little frustrated with new authors releasing first books in a trilogy when I didn't know their writing well enough to trust whether or not I wanted to get bogged down in a huge series. So, I decided that I wanted my first book to be a stand-aloneâ€”a self-contained epic fantasy story that could show off what I could do without expecting people to wait years and years to see if I could finish a story or not.
