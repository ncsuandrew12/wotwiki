# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#3)

#### Aidan Moher

Your first novel,
*Elantris*
, was well received by critics and fans alike, even earning you a mention from Robin Hobb as a new author to watch out for! What do you do to keep yourself grounded in what is undoubtedly an exciting time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Honestly, I still can't believe it sometimes when I see my books up there on the shelves with Robin Hobb's, Orson Scott Card's and others by my favorite authors. Reading their works helps me realize that I've still got a long way to go! On the whole, authors, even very popular authors, don't have to deal with the type of celebrity hype of say, movie stars. When you only get a little recognition, it is easier, I think, not to let it go to your head!
