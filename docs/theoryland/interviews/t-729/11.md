# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#11)

#### Aidan Moher

Just taking a look at the names of your characters, it's obvious that you put a lot of thought into the cultures that inhabit your world and the naming structures that they would have in place (no randomly pulling from the "Big Ol' List o' Fantasy Names"). What is it about this aspect of world building that appeals to you so much?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A fantasy world can seem so much more full and interesting when it has many diverse cultures, just like the real world does. I try to produce the feeling of a wide range of cultures in my fantasy settings by creating groups of names that sound culturally consistent.
