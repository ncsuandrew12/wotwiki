# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#10)

#### Aidan Moher

Another of your complex creations are the Aons you created for
*Elantris*
. Where did the inspiration for this symbolic language come from? Did you create all of the designs yourself as you wrote the novel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I spent two years in Korea as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. One aspect of Korea that particularly interested me was the written language. This interest in Asian writing systems later sparked the idea of Aons. The Aonic symbols at the beginning of each chapter of
*Elantris*
increase in complexity as you continue through the book. I did create the designs myself, though luckily Tor had someone who could make them look better than my original messy sketches!
