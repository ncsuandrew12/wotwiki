# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#12)

#### Aidan Moher

How did your experiences differ when writing
*Elantris*
as compared to writing Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Elantris*
was my 6th novel. By the time I wrote Mistborn, my 13th, I'd figured out some things about writing and my own style that made me more effective. At least I'd like to think so! I wrote
*Elantris*
as a standalone, and I knew I wanted to make Mistborn the first of a trilogy. Even though I borrowed some ideas from my own earlier works, Mistborn was a more complex story and took more planning. I'd never written a trilogy before, so it was a little difficult to figure out how to wrap up the story in the first book, while still setting things up for the other two.
