# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#1)

#### Aidan Moher

Brandon Sanderson is a hard working guy. As you're about to find out, his first published novel,
*Elantris*
is actually the 13th novel he wrote! 13! And who said that was an unlucky number? Clearly Sanderson is passionate about what he does (write Fantasy novels) and it shows in his work.
*Elantris*
, "was Brandon's first published book. A stand-alone epic fantasy novel, the book won the Romantic Times award for best epic fantasy of 2005, was chosen by BarnesandNoble.com editors as the best fantasy or sf book of the year, and is forthcoming in fourteen languages (about half of which have been released as of September of 2007.)" (pulled from
[HERE](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/book.php?id=1)
) Needless to say the release of his two subsequent novels (the first and second book of a trilogy, respectively),
*The Final Empire*
and
*The Well of Ascension*
were met with eager anticipation by his fans.

Brandon is currently hard at work wrapping up the third novel in the Mistborn Trilogy and has just released his first children's novel,
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
!

Well, enough introductions; why don't we take a look at what Brandon has to say!

#### Footnote

*Elantris*
was actually Brandon's sixth novel; Mistborn was the thirteenth.
