#### Aidan Moher

Speaking of your web site, it's obvious that you've put a lot of time and effort into creating a web site that is full and deep of exclusive content to please your fans. My personal favorite are the extensive notes, annotations and comments you've made on your novels. It's fascinating to see the thoughts of the author as he ponders the same questions that I had as a reader. You've even got a whole novel up there on your web site for your fans to download and read! What is it that drove you to create such a rich web site?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The idea for the chapter annotations and deleted scenes is based on the bonus material that you can often find with movies on DVD. I really enjoyed learning more about the behind-the-scenes happenings in some of my favorite movies, and thought that readers might feel the same way about books.
