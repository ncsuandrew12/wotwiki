# [Interview #729: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#13)

#### Aidan Moher

What of the things that most appeals to me about you as an author is that you're also about to publish your children's novel,
*Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians*
. What compelled you to write a children's novel and how does it differ from writing a novel for adults?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Alcatraz*
actually started out as a freewrite. I'd been deep into the Mistborn books, and needed a break from their complexity and darkness. I decided to come up with something completely silly, so I wrote down a sentence that I'd thought of recently, and just started adding to it. When I finished I sent it to my agent, even though it was very different than what I'd written before. He suggested marketing it for kids, which we did, and it worked! In writing a children's novel I have to keep things simpler and shorter than I do when writing for adultsâ€”fewer viewpoint characters, simpler plot construction, more straightforward language. I actually really enjoy the variety of doing both types of novels.
