# [Interview #729, Entry #2]: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=729#2)

#### Aidan Moher

First off I'd like to congratulate you on the success of your novels,
*Elantris*
and
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
and your nomination for a Campbell Award!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks! Being nominated for the Campbell was a great honor, particularly when I look at the other authors that have been nominated during these two years. I've been really pleased at the reactions to my writing so far, and I'm excited to see what people think of the books I have coming out this year. (
*Mistborn: The Well of Ascension*
comes out from Tor this month, and
*Alcatraz Versus The Evil Librarians*
comes out with Scholastic in October.)
