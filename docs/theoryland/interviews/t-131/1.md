# [Interview #131, Entry #1]: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#1)

#### Isabel

I came to Leiden and met up with a (new) friend of mine. (Wolf Gaidin) We came like three hours in advance, because I expected about 500 people. I heard about US signings and there could be 500 people there. I was worried about being at the back of the line and I didn't want that. Of course when we arrived no one was there yet. In the end the people from the bookstore said that they would reserve some seats for us. So we went to have dinner.

When we came back, there were some more people at the bookstore. I was a bit shy and was really nervous, so I didn't say anything. One of those people is now a really good friend of mine (Aan'allein). He had a tape recorder with him and transcribed everything. I will use his report, because my report wasn't worth much.

Anyway, we ended up sitting right in front of RJ. He was interviewed from someone from the bookstore.

This report was written by Aan'allein. I have edited some comments out.

I am putting my own comments in between, so you will have some idea how I felt during it :-)
