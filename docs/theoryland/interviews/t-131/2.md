Jordan was asked something and answered:

#### Robert Jordan

That's alright...I like blue. I was given a computer, somebody sent me to a computer site, where they had lots of tests, where there was a gender test. Where you're to answer a series of questions and they'll tell you whether you're male or female. I don't know why people need to have this question answered, but... anyway, I was talking of going to the site. And eh... The questions were quite...obviously, you could see which, which you like better, circle or square. I'm not quite sure what this has to do with gender, but there it is. What color bedroom would you prefer to sleep in? Eh... And I was irritated, so it answered to the only 96% confidence that I was male [laughter] so this eh irritated me, but I think it was the bedroom, because apparently men are supposed to like sleeping in a white bedroom, rather than a blue bedroom. I don't understand this. I see a white bedroom, and I think, 'If I put anything down, some woman is going to walk in and tell me that I'm messing up the white bedroom.' [laughter] You know, I'm not even, gon...I shouldn't touch anything in this room, so...well, ... a whole different subject, it doesn't mean...never mind.
