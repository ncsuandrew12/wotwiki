# [Interview #131: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#29)

#### Aan'allein

When the line was almost done I went back in line again, getting Jordan to dedicate the books to me (instead of just having his autograph in them.) The interview-man was not happy with it, but at least I managed to get through... the people behind me who also were going for a second round weren't so lucky. (Of course, then the interview-man asked Jordan to sign a huge stack of
*Winter's Heart*
books for the bookstore, probably so they can sell them for a lot of money...)

#### Robert Jordan

While there I asked another quick question, "Are Mat and Perrin Heroes of the Horn reborn?", which got RAFO'd, as I feared. Sorry Witte, I tried.
