#### Question

You're using many different nicknames and pseudonyms. You write under Reagan O'Neill—fiction, Jackson O'Reilly—Westerns, Chang Lung ... why all those different names?

#### Robert Jordan

So people will know what they're getting. If you see something by Jackson O'Reilly you know not to expect a fantasy, you know that that's a Western book. Although now my publisher is mixing that up. He's reissued some of my old books: 'Robert Jordan writing as'. And I made them agree that they could only do this if they put the original pen name on the cover in letters as large as they use for Robert Jordan.
