# [Interview #131: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#4)

#### Question

From your biography, I did a lot searching on the internet, there are lots of books about you...that you can't remember the timelines exactly.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, no, I can remember the time. The timelines? [sounding very surprised]

#### Question

#### Robert Jordan

For the books...by some engineers, it seemed to be obviously necessary that ... but ... the flowpath charts were too complex to do on the computer. I finally figured out that doing the setup on the computer for the flowpath charts, which would have to be three-dimensional, at the very least, for the books, would take at least as long as writing one of the books, so it was easier to put it in my head, where I could at least have a better zoom facility than I could possibly have, ... a better resolution than on a computer screen.

#### Question

So you in your head you have a better capacity, you think, than on a computer?

#### Robert Jordan

Yeah, for my books that is, at least...
