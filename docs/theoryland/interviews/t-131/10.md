# [Interview #131: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#10)

#### Questioner

In Holland there is some contempt to the genre of fantasy.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, there's some contempt everywhere.

#### Quesioner

Well, I can't speak for the rest of the world, but what do you think of that?

#### Robert Jordan

I think it's foolish. There are many more people who write fantasy than are tagged with the ghetto-phrase fantasist, or fantasy writer. If you read A.S. Byatt, or 'The Magic Realists' you're reading fantasy. If you read any novel which has ghosts or spirits or time-weaving back and forward... many, many supposed main-stream writers write fantasy. And they just don't call it fantasy, eh... the worlds in their books are not set in reality at all, and that is fantasy. And... eh,
*A Midsummer Night's Dream*
, the epic of
*Gilgamesh*
, which is ... all over, it's a fantasy. I like to think of science fiction and horror as subsets of fantasy. They're particular sorts of fantasy.
