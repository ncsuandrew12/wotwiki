#### Question

I myself am a great fantasy lover, read Feist, Pratchett, Goodkind. Why should I read Jordan?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, I think I tell a good story, about people you will believe in. And... sometimes people you will recognize. It's eh... It's hard for a writer to produce characters people care about. I think that I have managed to write characters that people care about. They want to know what's going to happen with this person or that person.

#### Question

And that's what's so good about WoT?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, to some extent. There's more than that. I happen to think that they are good books.
