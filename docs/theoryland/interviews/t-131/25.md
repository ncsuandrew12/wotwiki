# [Interview #131: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#25)

#### Isabel

After the Q and A I went into the line to let him sign my books. I don't really know if I had a question as well. :) I do know that he asked how old I was. First he asked if I was 10, but after a few seconds he gave me 12. :) I did tell him I was 17 but he didn't believe me. :-)
