#### Robert Jordan

There was a question about the Tolkien movie and if anything similar would be done with WoT. Jordan mentioned the NBC miniseries, and the option to take options on the other parts. Also that each book deserved at least a miniseries. Perhaps
*New Spring*
could be done in a three-hour feature length movie. "I'm not saying that it will be done, but it could."

He also said that his editor was telling him that perhaps it was "time to start shopping this around again. I didn't have to go to him to say 'hey you think anybody would be interested?'"

Another point he mentioned was that if nothing would happen he wouldn't mind it too much, he never set out to write movies.
