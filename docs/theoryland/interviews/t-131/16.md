# [Interview #131: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#16)

#### Aan'allein

I guess at this point we were some 40-45 minutes after Jordan's entrance. Time for the audience questions. Because there were so many people it would be a good idea for people to stand before asking their question so that there would be no confusion.

Jordan took the lead by first answering the common questions.

#### Robert Jordan

The next book will be out very soon after he's finished writing it. He don't know how many more books there'll be. At least three. If he can finish it in three, he will. (I think it was also at this point that he mentioned that if
*The Eye of the World*
contained all that he had originally planned for it, it would go all the way to what is now
*The Dragon Reborn*
.)
