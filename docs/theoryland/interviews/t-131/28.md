# [Interview #131: Leiden Signing Report - Aan'allein, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=131#28)

#### Aan'allein

Do Sarene and Corele have ageless faces? He didn't seen to recall the names, so I said "at the end of
*Winter's Heart*
, the Aes Sedai with Flinn who attack Demandred..."

#### Robert Jordan

Uh yeah, uh well, no no. Uh, some of them do, yes, some of them have ageless faces, but not all of them.

#### Aan'allein

But do the two who were in the circle with Flinn have ageless faces?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, let's see.. oh, the two who were in the circle with Min?

#### Aan'allein

Flinn.

#### Robert Jordan

Flinn, ah... Just trying to remember which ones I had with which one...

#### Aan'allein

Sarene and Corele.

#### Robert Jordan

Sarene Nemdahl does have an ageless face and ehh... I think Masuri... no Masuri was not.... I'm sorry, I actually forgot who I...

#### Aan'allein

[And then the silly man who had done the interview interrupted us and talked about the time and that it was getting late. So I thanked Jordan and circled around the line to go stand close to the table where he was signing, see if I could pick up any more interesting tidbits. Well, at least we now know for sure that one of the Aes Sedai had an ageless face, so that Demandred should have seen this if he was as close to them as those opposing Taimandred claim.]
