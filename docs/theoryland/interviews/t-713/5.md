#### Question

Do the Seanchan know how to make
*cuendillar*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're trying to figure out if the collar Semirhage put on Rand is
*cuendillar*
. (this was a long convo so I can't remember all of it... I THINK he said the original had been made of
*cuendillar*
, and that the Seanchan had copies of it, but would not answer whether those were made of
*cuendillar*
as well. He wouldn't say if Rand was wearing a copy or the original, he said it didn't matter. And that he knew of at least two ways to destroy
*cuendillar*
â€”The True Power and
[one other way](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#10)
. He looked thoughtful when Muirenn mentioned the theory that women make white
*cuendillar*
and men make black
*cuendillar*
, but wouldn't confirm or deny.)
