# [Interview #713: TGS Signing Report - Claireducky, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=713#2)

#### Claire

Is Laras Mesaana?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RJ once stated that Mesaana had not been seen on screen in her assumed identity yet as of the end of
*Knife of Dreams*
. And we see Laras in
*New Spring*
.

#### Muirenn and Az

But is the Laras in
*New Spring*
the same as the Laras we see now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*laughs\* RAFO.

#### Footnote

This was directly contradicted by
[earlier reports](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=174#2)
on RJ signings, and Brandon cleared it up
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#1)
: Mesaana's alter ego
*had*
been seen 'on screen', and her identity was revealed in
*Towers of Midnight*
.
