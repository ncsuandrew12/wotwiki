# [Interview #713: TGS Signing Report - Claireducky, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=713#1)

The
[original report](http://forums.dragonmount.com/index.php/topic,50071.msg1360812.html#msg1360812)
has gone missing. I'm hoping to hear back from Claireducky one day on whether or not she saved a copy of the report, but these Q&A are reconstructed from the old interview database, which means that only plot-related questions were saved.
