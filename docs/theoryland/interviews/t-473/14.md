# [Interview #473, Entry #14]: TGS Signing Report - Freelancer](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#14)

#### Question

Is Rand's access to the True Power via his link with Moridin, created at Shadar Logoth?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No one may channel the True Power without the Dark One's permission, and Rand doesn't have that.

#### Footnote—Terez

This answer was challenged by another person who was at the Q&A, though Freelancer said later his question was asked at the signing table.

broken.

#### Writo

Oy,

I was at that signing, I was literally right next to Brandon as he answered this question, and that is far from his exact wording.

The response was more accurately something like: So far as we know, no one may channel the True Power without the Dark One's permission. Semirhage certainly seemed to think she was betrayed.

There was never a comment about Rand not having permission.

#### Footnote—Terez

After this came to light, Matt Hatch
[asked](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=482#20)
Brandon about it, and he said that he never said Rand didn't have permission. Later I asked him if one normally has to visit Shayol Ghul to get permission, and he
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=605#29)
yes. Freelancer
[responded](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=58439#80339)
thus:

#### Freelancer

Brandon's later answer has to take precedence. He says that he didn't specify directly whether Rand did or did not have the Dark One's permission. That is what everyone must operate by, as his word is now canon. That does not change what I wrote down as my questions were being answered.

As to Writo's comments, I can only offer this. The comment by Brandon about Semirhage believing she had been betrayed was definitely in response to someone else's question. It did not come up with mine, but I do remember hearing it.
