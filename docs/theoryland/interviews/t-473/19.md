#### Question

Was the Compulsion which Elza told Semirhage about Verin's work from after Dumai's Wells, and was it Shaidar Haran who told her about it and to ask Semirhage to remove it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

How did Elza defeat the wards on Cadsuane's plain wooden box?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Elza had been given knowledge of several rarely known weaves, and in other ways made into a tool of Shaidar Haran. Not all of it was pleasant for her.
