# [Interview #473: TGS Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#16)

#### Question

Is Tuon's new name, Fortuona, an intentional play on the Latin
*Fortuna*
? Many see this as a semantic trick for calling her Lady Luck, which fits being Mat's wife.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Good question, and I'm going to allow you to say yes, as I don't think anything of that nature was done without a purpose, but it was Jim's (Robert Jordan) choice, which Maria dug out for me when I realized I needed to create a new name for her upon ascending as Empress.

#### Freelancer

(Hah! All you naysayers who bagged on Brandon for this, saying Jordan would never have chosen such a goofy name.)
