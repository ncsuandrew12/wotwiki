# [Interview #473: TGS Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#13)

#### Question

Has Graendal's death in any way acquitted her as a suspect in Asmodean's death?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(short pause) No. (longer pause) For that matter, I'm not saying definitively that she's dead.

#### Freelancer

(I followed up on this, describing my logic regarding Ramshalan, and got a strong nod, but no more words.)
