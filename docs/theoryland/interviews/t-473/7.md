#### Question

Did Verin have anything to do with the attack on Demira Sedai in Caemlyn?

RAFO+. Even though Verin's gone now, so much Verin discussion remains that it shouldn't be disturbed. (He took several seconds deciding to RAFO, if that means anything.)

#### Footnote

The attack on Demira was ordered by
