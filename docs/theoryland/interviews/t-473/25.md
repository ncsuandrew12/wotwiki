# [Interview #473: TGS Signing Report - Freelancer, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=473#25)

#### Freelancer

A thank you to Patrick and Mike at Mysterious Galaxy for their patient and pleasant natures. It was a very long day for them, and I for one appreciate how well they managed everything.

This is already a wall of text, so the questions will follow. I just wanted everyone to know how personable and engaging Brandon was to everyone with whom he came in contact. Never once did he give the impression that he wished he weren't there, or that he was burned out by this tour, and he thanked everyone for being faithful readers.
