## [Entry #1](./t-238/1)

#### Tremul

Literally just got back from the signing. I pulled an all-nighter to get to the signing from Seattle so I'm a bit jittery right now. Apologies in advance from ramblings that are to follow.

## [Entry #2](./t-238/2)

#### Robert Jordan

He started off the Q&A session with a couple of his own:

Question From RJ: The second person is going to lean over and ask "When is the next book coming out?"

Answer: 100% positively, guaranteed, no reservations, it will be out very very shortly ... after I finish writing it.

## [Entry #3](./t-238/3)

#### Robert Jordan

Question 2 From RJ: The next person in line is going to ask me who killed Asmodean.

Answer: I'm going to reach over the table and pop him in the face!!! Someone has figured it out and posted his theory onto the web. The theory is based on his deductions, not his guesses (slightly paraphrased).

## [Entry #4](./t-238/4)

#### Robert Jordan

Question 3 From RJ: The next person in line is going to ask how many more books are left.

Answer: Can we all say it together? One more book. I don't care if it has to be 2000 pages and you have to wheel it out the door. One more book.

## [Entry #5](./t-238/5)

#### Tremul

Now onto the crowd. Most of the questions were related to his inspiration, life and such. Most had been asked before so I'll just concentrate on the ones asked that concerned the book.

## [Entry #6](./t-238/6)

#### Question

Is the rest of the world (non main continent) aware that the Last Battle is at hand?

#### Robert Jordan

Depends on who you ask in each of the lands. Each land has it own prophecies and beliefs. As to what those beliefs are ... RAFO.

## [Entry #7](./t-238/7)

#### Tremul

Do Min and the Finns do the same thing when predicting and answering questions?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

## [Entry #8](./t-238/8)

#### Question

Why don't the Gardeners have the Longing?

#### Robert Jordan

That's simple. There are a lot more
*stedding*
on the Seanchan continent and as a result they were not missed during the Breaking, so they don't have the Longing.

## [Entry #9](./t-238/9)

#### Tremul

I'm still in San Fran and I forgot my Digital Camera link so I will post pictures from the signing as soon as I get home (Saturday). This was my first signing and it was so good I'm trying to figure out how to make it to the Half Moon Bay signing tomorrow. Here's to hoping.
