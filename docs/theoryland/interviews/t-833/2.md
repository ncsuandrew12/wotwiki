# [Interview #833, Entry #2]: KOD Signing Report - Brian](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=833#2)

#### Brian

One person asked about a rumor that there would be a 13th book and he stood up and addressed the line.

#### Robert Jordan

He informed us that the next book would be the last book for this "story", it might be a 2,000 page hard cover that you need a luggage cart to get out of the bookstore but it will be the last one.

He also mentioned that after the last book he is considering two more prequels but I got the impression that he was not completely committed to both of them.
