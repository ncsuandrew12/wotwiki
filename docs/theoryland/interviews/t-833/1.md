# [Interview #833: KOD Signing Report - Brian, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=833#1)

#### Brian

Hi all,

I just got back from the signing at the B&N store in Warwick, RI.

My wife and I arrived at about 11:45am, about 45 minutes before the signing, we were the fifth people in line. The booksellers had some minor issues setting up a sound system after about 15 minutes of playing with the feedback machine one made the comment that they hoped he had a "booming" voice.

#### Robert Jordan

They announced him and he came in and before sitting down ran through a brief pronunciation guide. He had a wry smile on his face as he went through the litany.

While the booksellers said only hardcovers, the person in front of me had the comic and when Mr. Jordan saw it he turned and said, "I am going to need a sharpie for this." One was produced and after signing the cover he informed the person to let it dry otherwise it would smear. He was also adding small personalization if the person wanted.
