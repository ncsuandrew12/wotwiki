# [Interview #748, Entry #4]: Interview with Isaac Stewart, the man behind the maps of Mistborn and The Way of Kings](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=748#4)

#### Trevor Green

Your website mentions a lifelong desire to write and illustrate books. Tell us what's been going on with you writing-wise. You have a book coming out soon through Deseret Book, right?

#### Isaac Stewart

Kenneth Pike and I put together a book called
*Jacob's Journal of Doom*
(link

) Deseret Book acquired for publication on July 31st of this year. Anybody familiar with the Wimpy Kid books will see the initial similarity: a story unfolds through the writings and drawings of an eleven-year old keeping his journal. The goal here was to create a character and story that LDS middle-graders can identify with without hitting them over the heads with heavy-handed lecturing. Besides being LDS, one of the things that sets Jacob apart is his imagination. There's a bit of a
*Calvin and Hobbes*
vibe as Jacob imagines himself as a ninja or his family as space aliens.
