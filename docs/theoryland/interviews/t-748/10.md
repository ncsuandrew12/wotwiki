# [Interview #748, Entry #10]: Interview with Isaac Stewart, the man behind the maps of Mistborn and The Way of Kings](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=748#10)

#### Trevor Green

Do you feel like the art you've provided for the various novels has fueled your desire to create your own worlds, or is it a separate animal all together?

#### Isaac Stewart

Stories and art were always separate things in my head. But my art has somehow begun to pave the way for my own story-related projects. My love of art and story have accidentally collided. It's so obvious, I didn't know why I didn't think of combining them that way before. Talk about the biggest duh-moment of my life.
