# [Interview #748: Interview with Isaac Stewart, the man behind the maps of Mistborn and The Way of Kings, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=748#3)

#### Trevor Green

Most of us know you for your work on Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn and
*The Way of Kings*
. What are some things you've been involved with that we might not be as familiar with?

#### Isaac Stewart

I've been working in the 3D animation field since 2000, specifically educational videos, graphic design, and video games. A couple of the more well-known projects I've worked on are
*A Kingdom for Keflings*
for xBox 360 and
*Twisted Metal*
for the PS3. For a while I co-authored a webcomic, Rocket Road Trip (link
[here](http://rocketroadtrip.com/)
) with my good friend Shawn Boyles (link to his site
[here](http://spikethesurfdog.blogspot.com/)
). We highlight the everyday life of a family of monster hunters who take their monster-hunting life on the road. We rarely update anymore, due to demands on both our time, but what's there is certainly worth a read through.
