#### Trevor Green

Thanks for being a wonderful guest Isaac, I very much appreciate the consideration.

#### Isaac Stewart

Thanks for the chance to be interviewed on your blog, Trevor. I'm interested to see where your writing and webcomics take you. I've done a fair amount of both (writing and comics), and they're fun roads to travel.
