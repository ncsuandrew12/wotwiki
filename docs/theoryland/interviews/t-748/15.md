# [Interview #748: Interview with Isaac Stewart, the man behind the maps of Mistborn and The Way of Kings, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=748#15)

#### Trevor Green

I believe you create merchandise for
*The Way of Kings*
and Mistborn. How's that going? Do you ever see people wearing your stuff out in the wild?

InkWing Arts (link

) is the business my wife Kara and I have put together to showcase the artwork I've created for Brandon's worlds. Right now we primarily sell bookmarks and t-shirts, but watch in the future as we add patches, art prints, and games. The goal there is to make cool things based on cool worlds. It's been a lot of fun to interact with fans in this way.

I mostly see the shirts at Brandon's signing events. But my eleven year old son came to me the other day and said he saw someone wearing one our shirts at the grocery store. He thought that was pretty cool. So did I!
