# [Interview #748, Entry #7]: Interview with Isaac Stewart, the man behind the maps of Mistborn and The Way of Kings](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=748#7)

#### Trevor Green

On a similar note,
*The Way of Kings*
has a lot of symbols associated with different aspects of the book. Were you involved with creating those, and if so, how did you design them?

#### Isaac Stewart

I created forty-plus symbols for
*The Way of Kings*
. Many of these are found in the color charts in the hardcover version of the book (link
[here](http://www.isaacstewart.com/stormlight-archive-artwork/)
). My absolute favorites are used at the beginning of each Part (one of them is debossed on the book's hardcase beneath the dust jacket). I used Arabic word art and the shard blades as inspiration for these. Many of the originals were drawn on an iPod Touch and later brought into Photoshop for clean up.
