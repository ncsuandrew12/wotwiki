# [Interview #748: Interview with Isaac Stewart, the man behind the maps of Mistborn and The Way of Kings, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=748#8)

#### Trevor Green

You did the maps and artwork for
*Vodnik*
by Bryce Moore, which just came out recently. (For those of you who don't know,
*Vodnik*
is set in Slovakia, which is a real place. Just, you know, FYI.) You told me a while back that designing a map of an existing place has some unique challenges. What were some of the things you came up against, and how did you overcome them?

#### Isaac Stewart

Designing the book, cover, and maps for
*Vodnik*
had some unique challenges, many of which Stacy Whitman (Bryceâ€™s editor) and I have already detailed at these links:

These were the first maps of a real place I'd ever done. The biggest problem we had to overcome with them was finding open source satellite images I could use as reference in making the maps. Google Fu came helpful here as Bryce used his Librarian powers to find maps we could legally use.
