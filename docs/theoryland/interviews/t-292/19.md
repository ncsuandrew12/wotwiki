# [Interview #292: Robert Jordan's Blog: A Small Addition, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=292#19)

#### Robert Jordan

Well, that's about enough of that for a short addition. It is about time for lunch, and I think I'm going to have a bowl of the left-over soupe au pistou. Soup, and stew, are always great if they have a few days to sumption around, letting the flavors mingle. I know some disagree with that heartily, but I stand where I stand.

Take care, guys.

Later.

RJ
