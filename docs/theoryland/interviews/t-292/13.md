# [Interview #292: Robert Jordan's Blog: A Small Addition, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=292#13)

#### Robert Jordan

For Richard Maxton, I'm glad that I am able to help, in however small a way. You have a rough job. We used to know a fellow—he has since moved to another city—who was a pediatric oncologist. I always thought that was about as rough as it could get. My prayers are with you.
