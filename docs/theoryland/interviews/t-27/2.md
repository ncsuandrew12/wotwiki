# [Interview #27: KOD Signing Report - NaClH2O, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=27#2)

#### NaClH2O

Deadsy had sent me a
[Question of the Week](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#8)
that she had asked, the one about the configuration of the roof of the White Tower. The Barnes & Noble (or Tor I'm not sure which) clone said that it was against the rules to have this signed. I protested a bit and she called in a higher level clone.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ was listening to all this and said, "It's okay, I'd be happy to sign it. I'll sign anything as long as it's not certain male body parts." So I got it signed. And gave him the CD Deadsy had sent as well. He mentioned that bribes did not work and Deadsy would still not know the answer to "Boxers or Briefs". He seemed to be in a very jocular mood.
