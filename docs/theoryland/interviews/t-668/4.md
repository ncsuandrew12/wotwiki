#### Brandon Sanderson

Several of the stores I've signed at recently have autographed copies of my books that they can ship to you. Forbidden Planet in London, Murder by the Book in Houston, Joseph-Beth in Lexington, UBooks in Seattle, among others. Check my Facebook
[past events](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson?sk=pe)
page and give the store nearest you a call. (You don't have to be a Facebook member to see the info.)

And I'll be signing throughout the UK all the rest of this week, so check out my events page to find the signing nearest you.
