# [Interview #508: JordanCon: Interview with Maria Simons by Richard Fife, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=508#5)

#### Richard Fife

What is it like working with Brandon?

#### Maria Simons

Working with Brandon is wonderful. Brandon is amazing. He works so hard. He doesn't have this big ego trip; he never says, "Hey, I'm the writer. You can't tell me that this character would never say that." He listens and keeps insisting that this isn't his book, it's Jim's, and he means it. I mean, that's how he really feels. He's working to put out the books that Jim would approve of. And he is succeeding.
