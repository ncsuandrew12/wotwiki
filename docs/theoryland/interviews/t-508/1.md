# [Interview #508, Entry #1]: JordanCon: Interview with Maria Simons by Richard Fife](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=508#1)

#### Richard Fife

So, if it is one thing that is known about Maria Simons, assistant to Robert Jordan, it is that she could bluff an Aes Sedai a county over with her poker face, and she doesn't even have to sing a song about it. Yet, as part of the my grand scheme to secure interviews with the members of Team Jordan, I went up against the grand master of serene, noncommittal visages and dared ask my questions.
