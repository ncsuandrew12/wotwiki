# [Interview #508: JordanCon: Interview with Maria Simons by Richard Fife, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=508#7)

#### Richard Fife

OK, so you have known the secrets and have been poker-facing us all for a very long time. Is there anything that you felt was a surprise for the fans to key in on, such as the Asmodean mystery, or perhaps something you thought they should have but didn't?

#### Maria Simons

The fans are really amazing. They seem to pounce on pretty much everything, even when there's nothing to pounce on. I have pretty much never been disappointed by the fans' reaction to anything, although I never really understood why so many people were obsessed with who killed Asmodean. But the Verin discussion—Very Old Verin, the Purple Ajah, and all that—was just so much fun, and I'm so glad I can talk about my favorite sneaky Brown now. Verin rocks!
