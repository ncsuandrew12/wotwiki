# [Interview #508: JordanCon: Interview with Maria Simons by Richard Fife, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=508#4)

#### Richard Fife

What was it like working with Jim and doing the filing for him?

#### Maria Simons

It was great to work for Jim. We started off just doing fan-mail and filing. He was finishing up
*A Crown of Swords*
, and he wouldn't let me help copyedit because he didn't want to spoil me. But, as time went on, I convinced him to let me organize his notes: that is when I found out the truth about Verin. And when
*The Path of Daggers*
came along, he let me work on it.

And he was great. He'd come in singing in the morning, he would say thank you, and he bought me cookies. If I made a mistake on anything, he didn't fuss and yell, he just said "Fix it." He was just fabulous to work for, and Harriet is too.
