Any particular favorite scene in the books?

#### Maria Simons

My favorite chapter is chapter five of
*Lord of Chaos*
called "A Different Dance." It's a chapter that showcases Mat; Mat is magnificent. He is in there trying to pick up Betse Silvin, and she's running circles around him. Talmanes is humming "A Frog on the Ice," Mat and Betse dance, and he remembers dancing with a Sea Folk woman. Then he goes out and takes down a Hunter for the Horn with a low blow and meets Olver. It is just a beautiful Mat showcase, and I think that is when I just totally fell in love with the character.
