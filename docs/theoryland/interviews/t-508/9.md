#### Richard Fife

Well, at least it was only two letters and not four. OK, the last question: without using four letters, who killed Asmodean?

#### Maria Simons

If you look at the back of my car, you can see "I killed Asmodean!"

#### Richard Fife

There we have it. It wasn't Graendal, but Maria Simons the entire time.
