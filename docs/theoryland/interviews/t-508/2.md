# [Interview #508: JordanCon: Interview with Maria Simons by Richard Fife, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=508#2)

#### Richard Fife

When did you first meet James Rigney?

#### Maria Simons

He was invited to my wedding, but I don't think he was there; Harriet was. I first met him in 1994, when my father-in-law died and Harriet and Jim hosted a reception for the family after the funeral. I was really proud because I didn't go all fangirl on him, but I did talk to him and tell him how much I enjoyed the books.

And when did you get involved with The Wheel of Time?

#### Maria Simons

In 1996, my husband ran into Harriet on the street and said "Do you know anybody who needs an editor?" because I had worked as an editor before. She said "No, but we could use help with fan-mail and filing." So we ran into them at a cocktail party later that week, Jim and I sized each other up, and I started working twelve hours a week in January 1996.
