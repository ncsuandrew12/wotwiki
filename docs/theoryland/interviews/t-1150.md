## Entry #1

#### FeatherWriter

Is something wrong with Roshar's afterlife?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, why do you ask?

#### FeatherWriter

Because of the Tranquiline Halls stuff? Needing to reclaim them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um. So, I'm... not going to answer anything about Roshar's afterlife.

#### FeatherWriter

Kay, alright.

## Entry #2

#### FeatherWriter

Do you know what color, off the top of your head, the soulcaster is supposed to be? First book said gold and the second book said silver.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the soulcaster.

#### FeatherWriter

Is that a Peter...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe silver is the accurate one. That's a PAFO, though.

## Entry #3

#### FeatherWriter

Is Iyatil from Southern Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Iyatil (he pronounced it like yah-till) has heritage along those lines, but she is not.

#### FeatherWriter

Is her mask Invested?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mmm, no.

## Entry #4

#### FeatherWriter

Do the Ire age because they're not on Sel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(uncertain) Uh, they do...? They... they age, but it's not the sort of aging that you and I do.

#### FeatherWriter

Okay! Interesting...

## Entry #5

#### Paladin Brewer

Is Threnody in the same planetary system as Sel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No it is not.

## Entry #6

#### Paladin Brewer

If a Shard's Vessel dies and drops a body and two people step in to take up the power, what would happen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #7

#### Paladin Brewer

Did the original 16 break Adonalsium with the intent to gain the shards and the power, or was that a happy/unhappy side effect?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #8

#### Paladin Brewer

Are Shard vessels able to have children?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes they are.

#### Paladin Brewer

Even Sazed, with his body being a eunuch?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, though technically all of Scadrial are the children of Preservation and Ruin.

## Entry #9

#### Paladin Brewer

If Preservation and Ruin created life on Scadrial but did not create Feruchemy, where does it come from? The Planet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

All magic systems come from Shards power in some way.

#### Footnote

WSB: I thought there were magic before the shards originated from the shattering of Adonalsium

## Entry #10

#### Paladin Brewer

Why do some spren not receive the Nahel-bond?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #11

#### eagle

How close are all of the shard worlds in space?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Not verbatum) The cosmere takes place in a dwarf galaxy and all the worlds are close together.

#### eagle

Close as in say 10 light-years?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More like 50. He went on to say that Peter has some harder numbers and that it might have to change a little.

## Entry #12

#### Paladin Brewer

Has Odium ever been to Threnody?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #13

#### Paladin Brewer

The metal used on Shardblades for training, is it made out of aluminum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This question seemed to get the most reaction out of him. He laughed and smiled, and said "that's a very smart question, well done, you're on the right track."

## Entry #14

#### Paladin Brewer

Which of the 16 original shardholders know Hoid the best?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #15

#### Paladin Brewer

Is Hoid related to any of the 16 original Shard bearers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #16

#### Paladin Brewer

How far can a shardholder see beyond his own world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the spirit realm they can see infinitely.

## Entry #17

#### Paladin Brewer

I assume Sazed does not know the metal used in Lessie's spike because it's offworld, but Odium seems aware of Sazed/Harmony. Why is this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Odium has a lot more knowledge that Sazed, he has had the power longer, and there are forces purposely trying to limit Harmony's knowledge.

## Entry #18

#### Paladin Brewer

Can a kandra duplicate a parshendi carapace?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, they cannot.

## Entry #19

#### Paladin Brewer

Is it more difficult to Worldhop if you are carrying things with you, such as allomantic metals?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it is not.

## Entry #20

#### Paladin Brewer

It there a link between Trell and Nalt from Mistborn and Nu Ralik and Van Makik from Stormborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"No, there isn't, maybe just tenuously." He said something like that. He seemed confused that I asked that.

## Entry #21

#### Paladin Brewer

Was aluminum used in the shattering of Adonalsium in any way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## Entry #22

#### Paladin Brewer

Can a spren or Seon travel to another shardworld?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes they can, though are more bound to their world but they can travel else where.

## Entry #23

#### Paladin Brewer

Can Sazed communicate with Leras or Ati?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he cannot.

## Entry #24

#### Paladin Brewer

Why did Hoid not take both beads of lerasium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid has an innate ability to know where he needs to be and what he needs to do.

## Entry #25

#### Paladin Brewer

In Way of Kings SYl leaves Kaladin before he means Hoid because she gets a bad feeling, did this have to do with Hoid himself or something unrelated?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, I believe. I don't remember an answer for it. unsure emoticon.

## Entry #26

#### Paladin Brewer

Have Kelsier and Marsh communicated in any way post-Hero of Ages?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"I don't want to answer this right now, there will be other short stories that will go over this."

## Entry #27

#### Paladin Brewer

Marsh says Wax is "doing his brother's work," is this a reference to what Kelsier did in the past or present?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the past, as in Kelsier was trying to help the little people and people who could not help themselves.
