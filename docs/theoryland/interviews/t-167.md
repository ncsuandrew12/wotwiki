## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#1)

#### Tallis

Hello, I don't frequent newsgroups anymore, but RJ came by the Harvard Coop last night and I thought I'd tell you guys what I heard. Apologies if all this is old news; I've noticed other people have posted messages about his signings elsewhere, and they're probably a bit more substantive.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Anyway: First, he began pronouncing some random names from the books. The ones I remember: Ice-Sedai; Thal-ah-rhan-rayad (pronounced as though he was choking on something); Sahn-chan (with the "a" homophonic in both syllables); Say-deen; Say-dahr.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#3)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ then announced that someone had figured out who had killed Asmodean using only the clues found in the books including and preceding the character's death.

#### Tallis

Give me a break; one person figures it out, and he calls it "obvious" (at least according to the FAQ)? Agh. I really don't think it's Graendal anymore, considering the tremendous influx of theories of her culpability in the past X years. You'd think RJ would have commented on
*that*
several books/years ago...?

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#4)

#### Tallis

Other "revelations":

#### Robert Jordan

*Saidar*
would have definitely been tainted had female channelers participated in the sealing.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#5)

#### Robert Jordan

There are many clues as to Mesaana's identity, enough that we should figure it out before
*Crossroads of Twilight*
. He basically said that he'd full-out reveal her in upcoming books, though, "...and if you still don't know, well, you'll find out later."

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#6)

#### Robert Jordan

Ah, speaking of which, "Two more books."

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#7)

#### Robert Jordan

Rand has no direct connection with the Creator. The Creator is completely removed from the world; aside from...creating...the Pattern, he does nothing else whatsoever to influence anything.

#### Tallis

(I'm uncertain how this fits with the ending of
*The Eye of the World*
.)

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#8)

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO regarding Moiraine.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#9)

#### Robert Jordan

There are no formal educational systems; everything is—excuse the obvious—informal, but somewhat successful.

#### Tallis

All right, take care all.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#10)

#### Tallis

Ah, a couple more points I'd forgotten:

#### Robert Jordan

He bases his female characters after his wife.

#### Tallis

(The audience laughed a bit, and a couple of us wondered just how dense and imperious that woman must be...)

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#11)

#### Robert Jordan

I'm sure I misheard, but I could have sworn he talked about writing
*five*
prequels. Again, though, I'm uncertain.

#### Footnote

All the other reports about prequels support the notion that RJ planned, in addition to
*New Spring*
, only two more prequels: one about Tam al'Thor and the other about how Moiraine and Lan ended up in the Two Rivers in the nick of time.

## [Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#12)

#### Robert Jordan

He had always planned on killing Sammael per Mashadar; his death was not determined after the ambiguous ending of that book. RJ said something along the lines of, "Yes, I know it wasn't with trumpets and fanfare [referring to Sammael's death]; but he deserved it. He was a louse, and he got a louse's death. He was killed by an enemy he wasn't paying attention to. He lived like a louse, and he died like a louse."

#### Tallis

Yes, he said "louse" that many times, if not more. You'd think Sammael had personally wronged RJ, sheesh—he sounded pretty impassioned. Then again, it could simply be his exasperation with people refusing to accept that Sammael died.

## [Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#13)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ read the
*Encylopedia Brittanica*
numerous times as a child; he claims that's the crux of his education.

## [Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=167#14)

#### Tallis

And that is that.

Take care all.
