## [Entry #1](./t-469/1)

#### Yellowbeard

I went to one of the two Atlanta area signings yesterday. It was the evening one.

Got there an hour and a half late. Had to get home from work, take care of man/daddy duties (have a stressed out woman and three kids at home), do dinner, etc.

Got there just as they were starting to sign books. Waited for about an hour to get mine signed.

BS wrote "Peace favor your sword" and signed over his name.

Harriet wrote "Best, Harriet McDougal".

Unfortunately I missed the reading/talking/Q&A session.

## [Entry #2](./t-469/2)

#### Yellowbeard

I did get to ask a question Terez put me up to.

#### Brandon Sanderson

His answer was no, Heroes of the Horn are not always
*ta'veren*
at all in their lifetimes when spun out. Sometimes, they even live normal lives and don't do anything extraordinary, like they sometimes spend their lives as farmers, etc.

## [Entry #3](./t-469/3)

#### Yellowbeard

Harriet liked the Monty Python Black Knight t-shirt I wore, "just a flesh wound".
