# [Interview #21: LOC Signing Report - Ryan Gran, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=21#3)

#### Ryan Gran

One attendee (worked for a publishing company, used to work for Tor) had an advance reader edition of
*The Great Hunt*
—he'd never even opened it, was going to let RJ be the first. Also saw the leather bound editions of
*The Fires of Heaven*
and
*The Dragon Reborn*
—something like only 100 and 150 copies printed. They were asking around $200/each. My only problem with these books is that apparently they haven't done limited editions of the first three books (maybe they will?), but I couldn't justify the money for a partial limited edition series.

#### Footnote

Apparently Ryan meant he saw leather-bound editions of
*The Shadow Rising*
and
*The Fires of Heaven*
.
