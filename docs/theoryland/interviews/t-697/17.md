#### Cory

Will there be flashbacks for a different character in this next book?

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings#comment_24480586)

Yes. Each book will explore a different character in flashbacks, though Kaladin will also end up getting another book with flashbacks of his sometime down the line.
