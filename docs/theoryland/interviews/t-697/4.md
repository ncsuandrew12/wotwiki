# [Interview #697, Entry #4]: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#4)

#### Amanda

Will Kaladin (or Shallan, or any of the other characters) be going to visit the various places Kaladin saw in his dream, and if so, for extended periods of time or just short trips? I think the interludes are wonderful ways of showing other parts of the world, if I may also comment.

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings?page=1#comment_24479672)

I'm glad you liked the interludes. One of the reasons to include them is to show parts of the world that I won't be getting to for a while, but this is an epic, and there will be characters traveling to various places you've seen. Maybe not all of them, but some places will be visited. Some for extended periods, some for shorter periods.
