# [Interview #697: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #28](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#28)

#### Vladamir

I really want to know, Brandon how do you get these ideas about so diverse and innovative magic systems?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings?page=2#comment_24774254)

It just happens. I don't know. It's a blend of who I am — my science background, what I like in fiction, mixed with the way my mind works, what stories I seek to tell. I can't say specifically where I get the ideas, because they're all different. It's just part of my makeup.
