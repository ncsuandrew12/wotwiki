# [Interview #697: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#7)

#### Louise

Is spren lost their memories and personalities because of the loss of their attached radiants? But retain a basic attraction to things associated with the radiants they bonded to previously?

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings#comment_24479943)

Not all types of spren bonded to Radiants. You will find out more about this in the future. However, if you're speaking specifically of spren that were bonded to Radiants, then yes, you're on the right track.
