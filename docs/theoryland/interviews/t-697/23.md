# [Interview #697: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#23)

#### Gary

*The Way of Kings*
is certainly a great first book of a series. It does, however, leave one hungry for more. What's the best guess on when for #2? And does it have a name?

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings#comment_24480840)

I'll try to write it so it can be published in late 2012, but it really depends on how long it takes to write
*A Memory of Light*
, since I won't start until after that is finished. As for the title, if it ends up being a Dalinar book it will be titled
*Highprince of War*
, but if it ends up a Shallan book it will have a different title.

#### Footnote

He has decided that the second Stormlight Archive book,
*Words of Radiance*
, will be Shallan's book.
