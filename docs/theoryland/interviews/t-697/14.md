# [Interview #697: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#14)

#### Dustin

Can a Herald's blade/equipment be um....adopted? I only ask because Dalinar seems to be lacking one and that Herald at the end did kick the bucket in his capital and he's gonna need more than armor when Szeth shows up.

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings#comment_24480445)

Someone who is not himself or herself a Herald can indeed use one of the Honorblades.

#### Footnote

Just because he fell doesn't mean he's dead.
