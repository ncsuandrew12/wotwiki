# [Interview #697: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#13)

#### Dustin

I felt the illustrations added a lot to the book physically and to the story. Will there be more in book two and so on if you have your way or was it a one book experiment?

I'm glad you like what the illustrations added to the book and the story. I plan future volumes to have more of them.
