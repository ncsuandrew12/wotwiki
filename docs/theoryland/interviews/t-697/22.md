# [Interview #697: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#22)

#### Bri

I've read somewhere (probably your blog) that the Way of Kings will be made into ten parts. My question is this: Is it ten individual books, or really just ten parts? I notice that the first book had several parts in it so I was just curious.

#### [Brandon SandersonÂ (Goodreads)](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/446239-q-a-with-brandon-sanderson-way-of-kings#comment_24480747)

Ten individual books.
