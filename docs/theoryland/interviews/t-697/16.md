# [Interview #697, Entry #16]: Goodreads WoK Fantasy Book Club Q&A with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=697#16)

#### Flip

You have quite the world you have created. I look at the map and see a lot of different locations. How many of the named locations are actually going to be used? ... Anyway, I am always curious as to how much of one's world that has been built actually gets used.

You'll have to read and see what happens. I will say this: When I build a map, I don't consider it to be a to-do list. In fact, it makes a world feel unrealistic to me when every single place on the map ends up getting visited. So it's not a to-do list, but many of those locations are very important.
