#### Question

So ever since the Sleepless I’ve been wondering about what sentience is in the Cosmere. How would a Sleepless manifest on the Cognitive Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a good question, that’ll RAFO. But they are a single consciousness, but they would argue that all your cells are independent of you. So they are cells that can move around. They’re really fun, they started in a non-cosmere book when I was 22. Obviously a bit inspired by Fire Upon the Deep, one of my favourite science fiction books. And I read that book and I’m like, ‘group consciousnesses are cool!’ what if you had a species that was made up of--not like an Ender’s Game one, but like each swarm was an individual and they could breed and evolve their own things to do different stuff. So each of these little Hordelings is what I call them, but that might change since we’ve got cremling now. So each of these little bits is bred for a specific purpose, feed the swarm and stuff like that. So they’ve got a all kinds of stuff going on.
