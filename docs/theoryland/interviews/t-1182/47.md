#### Argent

I have a follow-up on the map? Most of the constellations seem fairly straightforward. The one containing Roshar has a Shardbearer or Herald…

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a couple that don’t make [sense]. Sel gets a lamp, yes.

#### Question

Why?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ask Isaac about that, he came up with the symbolism. And I like all the symbolism. But I would go to him about the symbolism of that. Ask him to write an essay for my website about it, because he has really cool-- Cause again, cause I said to him, ‘I want a star map’ and I wasn’t gonna put constellations on it, right? Just, the one in the back cover that doesn’t have constellations, that’s what I asked for and he came back and said ‘I did a constellation map with these things, what do you think?’ and I said ‘that’s cool!...Can you explain these to me?’ so I’m just gonna let Isaac go with that, he chose it, he chose the perspective and the point of view, so it’s his map, and he’s canon on that.
