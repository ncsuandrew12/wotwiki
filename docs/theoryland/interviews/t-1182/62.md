# [Interview #1182, Entry #62]: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#62)

#### Question

Speed bubbles-

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ehh these are the hardest ones...

#### Question

We’ve seen them work and move with trains, we’ve seen them not work with carriages: is there a size requirement, or is it how they view themselves…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a good question. So I build in this thing, right? I’m like “Oooh, speed bubbles! Speed bubbles are cool!” but the Delorean problem, right? You’re like “I’m going to go back in time: to the middle of SPACE”, because the planet is in the same position, right? This is stuff that science fiction writers have been having fun with since the silver age of science fiction. So I’m like “alright, I need to deal with the Delorean problem.” And so I’m like alright, we’re going to have to say that frame of reference is a big part of it: so perception and frame of reference is a big part of it; and also \_size\_ of the thing that you’re on. So it would be possible to use kind of cosmere cognitive training to get that speed bubble moving with you- and partially someone asked me a question about this on tour, I believe, so it would be in one of the reports—not this exact same thing, but “could they learn to move their speed bubble with them?”: and yes you can.

#### Question

So it is how the allomancer views it, not how the thing views itself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a \_part\_ of it. Partially how you view yourself,
. It’s really also mass. Big things- The speed bubbles required all kinds of physics-gymnastics—I’m sorry physicists—but once you start playing with time the stuff you gotta’ do… just crazy stuff you gotta’ do.

#### Question

We actually sat down and worked out what the metric would have to do to have a speed bubble- it was gnarly

#### Brandon Sanderson

We did run the math on these things, and stuff like that. And Peter- he’s like “redshift” and stuff like this we talked about, and all kinds of fun stuff about speed bubbles that I then had to-

#### Question

Khriss asked about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So- this one [presumably speed bubbles] and manipulating weight- those are the math ones where I’m just like-

#### Question

If you can get get massive \_enough\_ to move your speed bubbles-
[Laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So these are the ones where- they create the fun things to talk about, but they are where this is fantasy and not science fiction. A lot of these questions I could answer and you’d be like “alright, if there were this alternate power source we could buy this” but in this case we’re like exception-list of asterisks to make it work. But they’re too fun to not do, right? And I knew I was doing gravity on Stormlight, so I’m like I gotta do weight separately.
