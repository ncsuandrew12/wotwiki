# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#44)

#### Question

Does Silverlight have a permanent Perpendicularity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Silverlight has...weird. So I’m gonna give a RAFO to that.

#### Question

Cause, it’s got a physical constellation map. So they’ve gotta go to the Physical somehow right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, no, no. That can be in the Cognitive Realm.

#### Argent

The constellation map can be a picture from the Cognitive?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, yeah, I mean, it can be a picture in the Cognitive. That is a picture that exists in Silverlight.

#### Argent

Right, sure, but they need to be somewhere to view those things.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, I didn’t say that that’s from the perspective Silverlight, but the picture is hanging there.

#### Question

Is there actually anything on the Physical end of Silverlight?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s the RAFO. There can’t be a Perpen--well, there could be a Perpendicularity, but then you’d have to go someplace in the Physical, and it gets all... it’s really weird.
