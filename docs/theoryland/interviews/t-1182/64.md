# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#64)

#### Argent

I want to take us back to some Shards before we skip me for the fourth time. So there were a few of the Shards that Rayse Splintered, included Ambition, Dominion, and Devotion.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Argent

And those were all way back in history. So, we know that the Shard’s personality overrides the Vessel’s personality over time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Strongly influence, and depending on the Vessel, override.

#### Argent

So, did Rayse choose those Shards because--

#### Brandon Sanderson

He went after Ambition first, but didn’t find Ambition until after going after Devotion and Dominion. But Ambition was number one on his hit list.

#### Argent

Was it because of the Shard or because of the Vessel, or the person.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In this case it was the Shard primarily. He was afraid that this was a Shard that would rival him. But, he then got trapped in the Rosharan system.

#### Argent

Which is segue to Shards Investing in Shardworlds. So is it kind of a...passive...the more a Shard stays on a world, the Investiture kind of seeps…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it does. Once you’ve got a Perpendicularity, you are starting...That’s trouble for going other places. But you’ve gotta remember, going other places means multiple things to someone actually holding a Shard. They can exist in the Spiritual Realm, where all things are one. And they can even kind of comprehend it.
