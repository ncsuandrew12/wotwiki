#### Question

I want to know how Hoid travels between worlds. Or, if you won’t tell me right now, will we ever find out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hoid has traveled between the worlds by getting in one Shardpool in Shadesmar and coming out a different one. So that is one method he has used to travel between the worlds. The worlds are connected through Shadesmar. Um, things that people don’t think about as much reflect very minorly in Shadesmar, so most of the space between planets is cut out, and there’s some weird, twisted geography going on there.
