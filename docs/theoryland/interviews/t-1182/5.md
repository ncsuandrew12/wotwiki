#### Argent

There’s a scene in Way of Kings, where Syl appears full-sized. It’s the only time she does that, why is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was a very special moment. And there’s was some matters of connection going on, but in the Cognitive Realm, she’s full-sized, and so this is echoing that, so that when, if later on you were to see her, you’d be like ‘oh, she’s human sized’, that’s how she would appear.
