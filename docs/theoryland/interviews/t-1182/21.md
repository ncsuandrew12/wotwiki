# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#21)

#### Question

I noticed a very similar fire-starting tool in both Sixth of the Dusk and Forests of Hell [Shadows for Silence]. Two levers you push together and they spark.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did intend there to be a connection there but it is not a connection that is supposed to be super meaningful. Just that somebody figured something out, and Sixth of the Dusk is many years later. We have them in our world too. This technology has gotten around because the Ones Above have started visiting. I don’t think they’re of a technology level that they couldn’t have discovered it on their own, so it’s not supposed to be some big reveal.
