# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #52](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#52)

#### Question

Have we seen cameos of Heralds on other Shardworlds?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Heralds are tied to the system by the magic that permeates them. They could not leave. It’s part of the magic. Some would call them Cognitive Shadows, right? Whether they are or not. ‘Cognitive Shadow’ is a very ambiguous term in the Cosmere. It means, basically your soul-- Investiture replaced your soul, and permeated your soul, and your soul continues to exist, but you are usually Invested with something, that’s tied, and you’re basically like pure Investiture then. You’re tied to the thing you’re Connected to. Most of the things that you’re gonna see like that, traveling is going to be very difficult, unless you know how to do it. You have seen people do it.
