#### Question

Is the ball of Preservation energy that Kelsier used...is that Stamping, Hemalurgy, or a third kind of the same thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is a different thing. You haven’t really seen that before.

#### Question

Because it has similar effects…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, you haven’t seen that before. It was designed to do what it did.

#### Question

Is it...Connection, like a Connection orb?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We’ll get into this, this is involving Silverlight stuff, so let’s RAFO it for now.
