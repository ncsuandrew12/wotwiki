#### Question

Will there be any more Silence?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The world is very relevant to the Cosmere. I have several books planned there, I don’t know how many of them I’ll write. I will at least write one of them. Silence herself is not a character from the books, that story matched the world so I put it there. There will be other things from that world.
