# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #70](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#70)

#### Question

If you Soulstamp somebody to give them a Connection to Arelon, and they became an Elantrian, could they become an Elantrian, and if the Soulstamp were removed, would they remain?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, you’re asking a better one than people have asked. I will go ahead and RAFO this with the caveat of why this might not work, is because, you might think you’re something, right? Like, this is not completely invisible, and so, whether the powers are going to follow those lines of Connection or not I will leave up to discussion, but it is a possibility worth theorizing upon.

#### Question

So a Soulstamp doesn’t necessarily change the core of your Spiritual--

#### Brandon Sanderson

It does, but it’s overriding it. It’s like Hemalurgy. What you are is still there underneath when it’s ripped away.
