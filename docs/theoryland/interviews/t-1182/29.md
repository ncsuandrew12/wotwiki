#### Question

Has Denth ever been to Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So Scadrial is one of the planets thatâ€™s easier to get to, in Cosmere terms. I will say this: he did not travel the Cosmere widely. But Scadrial is one of the easier ones to get to - he spent a lot of time on Roshar, and did not travel widely.
