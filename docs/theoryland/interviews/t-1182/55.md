# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#55)

#### Question

Is there a Shadesmar for each planet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Anything that people think about, right? And, you really have to be inhabited to get a good Shadesmar… But, yenno, you can find the gas giants in Shadesmar, but they don’t manifest as an entire plain. Um, that’s gonna change! But we’re years away from that. Shadesmar is cool and weird but--

#### Question

Ohh, there’s only one Shadesmar with different areas--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, what we call it, Shadesmar is a term that has started to stick in the Cosmere for the Cognitive Realm. But there are manifestations for all planets.

#### Question

So, they all exist, all of Shadesmars are part of the same cloth, so to speak.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, you could walk from one to the other, barring some weird distortions that I’m not gonna tell you about.

#### Question

But spren can’t because they’re bound.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right. Unless, well, there are certain ways you could do it.
