#### Question

What is the experience of Steelrunning? It doesn’t speed up your mind, so how do you control yourself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Most forms of Allomancy give you a small boost to any attributes you would need in order to survive and manipulate it, just like atium. So you might have just enough to get some reactions and things, otherwise you just can’t do it. What I don’t have it doing is cancelling friction. I did that intentionally, so you can burn yourself up.
