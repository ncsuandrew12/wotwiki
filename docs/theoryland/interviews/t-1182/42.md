# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #42](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#42)

#### Question

Is it possible that someone could have gotten to the Cognitive Realm on Scadrial without the Well of Ascension?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

...Can we know how?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, how many Shardpools would Scadrial have?

#### Question

Two, so the Pits of Hathsin would be so?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. So you’ve adopted the term “Shardpool.” That was never really my term, but I’ve started using it. What happens with a Perpendicularity is large concentrations of Investiture, particularly purely attuned to one of the Shards, will create an access point. You’ve seen another one--

#### Question

Yeah, yeah I know these.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know which one I’m referencing?

#### Question

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That you didn’t see a Pool from?

#### Question

Oh wait…
[Laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, he knows, so… We’ll move on.

#### Question

Why??!! [general protest, laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, fine. Umm, at the end of Words of Radiance.

#### Argent

There has to be one there because Jasnah has to leave somehow, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but Honor’s Perpendicularity moves.

#### Question

Woah...so...Highstorm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[hems and haws]

#### Question

So, I don’t know if this is a RAFO sort of question, but you call them Perpendicularities, will we see this sort of thing created?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, Perpendicularities can be created. You’d need a ton of Investiture. But, basically what Jasnah does is create a little mini Perpendicularity and slips herself into the Cognitive Realm.

#### Question

So it’s just a question of skill, not a question of--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. It’s hard to pull off...but some of the powers are built to do it.
