# [Interview #1182, Entry #48]: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#48)

#### Question

So we know some people can survive going through Perpendicularities, but we also know, like, when Rock talked about the lake that people swam in, that Hoid came out of, he [Rock] said that some people who swam in it died. So, who can and can’t survive a Perpendicularity?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, you should not take much of what Rock says. When he says they swim in it and they die, they just went through the Perpendicularity. They just don’t come back; what would you think if someone swims and doesn’t come back; they have drowned.

#### Question

So pretty much anyone can?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is not traumatic to go through most Perpendicularities.

#### Question

So it depends on where, who and when?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh huh.

#### Question

Okay, that’s good to know.
