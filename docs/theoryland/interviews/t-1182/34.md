# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#34)

#### Question

I’ve been fixating on this mass exodus. The Iriali, are they the people of the mass exodus? I’ve always wanted it to be the people of Threnody.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Iriali are not native to Roshar. There is stuff going on on Threnody too, it shares some similarities.
