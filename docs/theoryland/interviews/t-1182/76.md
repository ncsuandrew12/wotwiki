# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #76](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#76)

#### Question

Are there requirements to join the Seventeenth Shard, and would they accept, for lack of a better term, a non-enhanced member?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes and yes. Well, um, Baon is not Invested.

#### Question

Well, what would they not like? We know they don’t like Hoid, and what he’s doing, but…

#### Brandon Sanderson

They do like what Khriss is doing, alright? This is an acceptable thing to them.

#### Question

What about when people start integrating themselves in [a] culture, is that gonna make problems?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They would prefer that people didn’t do that.

#### Question

So not Vasher?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher is very far from being the Seventeenth Shard! VERRRY far.
[laughter]

#### Argent

Is it fair to say that they are a community of scholars?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are a community-- well they are not all scholars, so I wouldn’t say that. I would say they are interested parties who do not want any planets to get destroyed.

#### Question

So they’re the Apocalypse Guard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They aren’t really able to prevent these sorts of things. They’re like...Oh what are they called in DC...But those guys are powerful though, so it’s not like that, but you can imagine it’s something like that, right? We’re watching, studying, we’re investigating and we’re trying to prevent... They’re like Starfleet right? They’ve got some Starfleet stuff right? We’re gonna go research and study these people, but we shouldn’t be involved. It’s less about Prime Directive, and more about what it’s something to do that it exacerbates the conflict between the Shards. The Shards split up for a reason, is what they think, and they should continue to be split up, and we should not dabble in bringing them back together.
