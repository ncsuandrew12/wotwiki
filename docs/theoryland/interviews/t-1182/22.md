#### Question

Is Nazh a cartographer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nazh knows more than the average person, but I wouldn’t call him a cartographer. I would describe him as a grumpy Cosmere James Bond, but not nearly as cool. Like, here’s the mission, get in, do this thing.

#### Question

My crazy theory is that Nazh is Isasik Shulin

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is not. Nazh is Isaac’s character, he designed him and came up with him. I said need somebody to be getting these, and the character is all him, doesn’t necessarily look like him. He wants to write some stories in the Cosmere; he might write about Nazh.
