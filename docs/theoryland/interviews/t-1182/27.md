#### Question

Can you tell us something about the magic on the Dark Side (presumably referring to Taldain)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not nearly as explosive and obvious as the magic on Dayside. Most of the Investiture youâ€™ll find is on Dayside, but there is some stuff going on over there. (This went with a book personalization which has been posted somewhere else)
