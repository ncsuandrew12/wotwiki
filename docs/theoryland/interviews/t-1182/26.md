#### Question

If Kaladin and Dalinar were Magic cards, what color do you think theyâ€™d be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Dalinar now is mono-White. He was mono-Red in his youth, inching toward Black-Red, but I would call him mono-Red. Kaladin I would call Blue-White because they like things that fly and that have to do with the wind. So he would get the elemental Blue and personality White. Maybe a tinge of Red, but I would make a Blue-White Kaladin.
