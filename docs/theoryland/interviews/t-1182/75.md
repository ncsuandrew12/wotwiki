#### Argent

Staying on Scadrial, have we seen the Resonances of either Wax or Wayne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, well, Wax is really good a sculpting bullets and things away from him.

#### Argent

The bubble.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah and things like this. This is playing with the fact that he is-- let’s just say that the abilities make this happen, and I’ll let you theorize on why, but it’s just an enhancement to what he can do.

#### Argent

I might be wrong, but I thought you said it was because he was becoming a Steel Savant.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, definitely, but this is what that’s coming from.

#### Argent

But being a Savant has to do with being really good with one power, and Resonance--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Being a savant has to do with using Investiture a lot, and it’s starting to permeate your soul.

#### Argent

So he’s more of a Savant with both of--

#### Brandon Sanderson

He’s used them a lot, and they are changing his soul, and so the powers are morphing and changing, just in slight, little ways, you’re not gonna see a whole bunch. Well, you can imagine these powers are sort of becoming one to him.

#### Argent

Yeah, I can see that. And Wayne?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wayne’s is not as obvious, I’ll go ahead and RAFO that right now.
