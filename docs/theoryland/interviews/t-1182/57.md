# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #57](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#57)

#### Question

So, why did Hoid in Secret History have to ride on another person to get to the Well, when that person could float on--

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sooo, what he’s floating on is a Cognitive Shadow, it’s a spirit, it’s not an actual person.

#### Question

Do we know them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You don’t know them, don’t worry about them. But see, he’s using that as a boat because it’s easy to sink through the mist. And if you notice, he has to coat his oar with Investiture in order to move him. So yeah, he’s floating on a person’s soul. It was so much easier with the Pits, but that’s because there were boats and things.
