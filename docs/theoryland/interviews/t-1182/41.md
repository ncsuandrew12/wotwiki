#### Argent

So, the Edgedancer’s Resonance, the Perk? You’ve called it Resonance at some point, is that still accurate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that totally works. The powers affect each other in interesting ways.

#### Argent

Right.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, so the thing about it is, calling it a Perk, that like saying--

#### Argent

It’s a side effect right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s...yes a “side effect”, it’s like, when the powers merge, they are always slightly different. For instance, Lightweaving from a Truthwatcher is different slightly--there will be things. So, you’re gave access to the Surges, but in combinations, they act a little differently from one another.

#### Argent

So is the Edgedancer’s Resonance something to do with communication? Because we see Lift…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah we’ll RAFO that.

#### Footnote

In the answer, "Lightweaving" should be Illuminating instead (Lightweaving is an order, Illumination is the surge).
