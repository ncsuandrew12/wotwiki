#### Question

So there’s a line in Secret History that mentions like, a mythical string that shows the way home in the maze of Ishathon. Is that an intentional reference to…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeacher. You shouls yes, so here’s one thing I do in the Cosmere, because my senior course was in folklore, I had a really good folklore ted all thank Dr. Thursby for this.
One of the things I learned in folklore - I don’t know if you guys have studied this, but it’s really interesting - societies come up with the same myths. Right? They do! You’ll find the biggest one is the Cinderella myth. There’s a version of this in every culture, and it’s shocking how they come up with the same beats.
So whether it’s like the string that leads you out or the breadcrumbs, different people will use different things, but these stories exist. Mythical mazes, you’ll find stories about [them]. So this is here to say that on Roshar for example, there are similar myths to ones we know.
