#### Question

Are there any greatshells in Roshar larger than the ones we’ve seen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### Question

So the Reshi Isles are the biggest?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, those are the biggest, and even with that I’m doing major fudging on the square-cube law. They’ve just spren-bonded, we’ll talk about this. Even with the spren, it’s a stretch. That’s as big as it gets. They could exist in the ocean because the square-cube law doesn’t apply the same way, with buoyancy and things. But I think we don’t need anything larger than islands.

#### Question

No Godzilla?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re bigger than some version of Godzilla.
