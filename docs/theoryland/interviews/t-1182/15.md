#### Question

Does Hoid have any relations other than his friends?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Like direct blood relatives?

#### Question

Yeah

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay. In the book when I wrote it, he did not. Dragonsteel isn’t 100% canon anymore so that may change, but he did not, and there are none in my mind right now, so he’s an only child right now. It’s unlikely to change, but asterisk because I haven’t written Dragonsteel yet.
Oh no, he had a little brother! Even in the original, he had a little brother.
