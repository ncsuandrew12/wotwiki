#### Argent

The essays in Arcanum, how trustworthy are they?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They’re pretty trustworthy, as much as you would trust a scholar nowadays who’s an expert in their field. Do know that they take place before Sixth of the Dusk occurs. These are contemporary with most of the books right now, not contemporary with all the stories in there [Arcanum Unbounded].

#### Argent

Were they all written at the same time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, same time for a little thing she was doing about the worlds for people.
