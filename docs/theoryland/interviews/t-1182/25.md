# [Interview #1182: Harold Washington Library Center-AU Tour, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1182#25)

#### Question

Are we going to hear much about Dustbringers in the near future?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it’s going to be very slight for a little while. I’m intentionally digging into these magics somewhat slowly, all the different orders, just we can get used to them. They’re one of the later ones. Let’s talk more about Bondsmiths and Skybreakers before we do that.
