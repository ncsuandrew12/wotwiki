# [Interview #267: Robert Jordan's Blog: A VERY BRIEF ADDITION, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=267#3)

#### Robert Jordan

For Chris Dalby, I wouldn't think of playing tricks on the staff here. At least, not beyond occasionally, when someone asks me to spell my name for identification purposes, spelling it R-i-c-h-a-r-d N-i-x-o-n or the like. No more than that. These guys are trying to keep me alive.

And for David Litwin, I've been in Montreal before on tour, and expect that sooner or later I'll be there again.
