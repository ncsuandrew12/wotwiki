# [Interview #266: Robert Jordan's Blog: A LITTLE MORE, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=266#2)

#### Robert Jordan

To Lynn, I'm sorry I missed you while you were here in Rochester. One of the nurses, Ken, told me that another SCT recipient was on the floor for a visit while I was getting my transplant, but not that you were a fan, or I'd have asked to see you. I'm sure they would have let you mask up and come in, if masking was even necessary at that point.
