# [Interview #266: Robert Jordan's Blog: A LITTLE MORE, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=266#1)

#### Robert Jordan

I received some additional acknowledgments from the Mayo of people who have sent money in honor of James O. Rigney, so here goes. My deepest thanks to Mr. Michael Nemeth, Mr. Ryan Tibbetts, Mr. Steven Odden and Mr. Spencer Martin. I really can't say how much this means to me.

One thing I should point out is that you won't receive an acknowledgement, and you won't get one either, not from me, if you send money in honor of Robert Jordan. Their patient is James O. Rigney, and they don't have a clue in the world who Robert Jordan is. Well, most don't.

Now, just a few tidbits, since there really isn't much happening here. I'm reading an old Tom Sharpe novel,
*Ancestral Vices*
, while waiting for a cousin to arrive for a visit, and the book is hilarious.

Now, then.
