# [Interview #266: Robert Jordan's Blog: A LITTLE MORE, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=266#4)

#### Robert Jordan

For NaClH2O, I like the idea of an Indian—my father rode one a long time back, and a fellow down the street has a magnificent red one—but I'm not sure Harriet would approve of a sidecar. I think she'll want her own bike. Lacquered in appropriate Wonder Woman colors and motif to suit her, I'd say.

I see that Deadsy is deep in discussion of my underwear again. Child, child.... Oh, well. A few words for your shell-like ear, Deadsy. Plain black or plain white, pure cotton or pure silk, but never red,or blue or any of those other suggestions. Those are for toyboys and pimps.

See you around, guys. And the last word for the day is, so far, so good. In fact, splendid.
