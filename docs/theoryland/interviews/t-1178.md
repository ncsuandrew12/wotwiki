## [Entry #1](./t-1178/1)

#### Question

Is Nalan using his original Honorblade, or did he bond a spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's using his original Honorblade. But there's an asterisk here that will come up in Oathbringer.

## [Entry #2](./t-1178/2)

#### Question

Does Silverlight exist solely in the Cognitive Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #3](./t-1178/3)

#### Question

Were the planets in the Threnodite System named like that in response to Ambition's demise?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is not a coincidence that so many of the planets have to do with songs of mourning or passing, in that system. So, you are on to something.

## [Entry #4](./t-1178/4)

#### Question

What does the Red Rip look like in the Cognitive Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So this is a RAFO, in part because I haven't revealed if there are any planets out there.

#### Footnote

(MY NOTE: Brandon totally knew where I was trying to go with this one, and he doesn't want to let us know if Yolen is part of the constellation.)

## [Entry #5](./t-1178/5)

#### Question

Was Bavadin nonhuman?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. There is at least one Shard who wasn't human, but I'm not ready to reveal who was or wasn't just yet.

## [Entry #6](./t-1178/6)

#### Question

What was the name of Ambition's Vessel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #7](./t-1178/7)

#### Question

Could only Lift see Szeth's afterimages?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Anyone sufficiently Invested can see them. Connection to the Cognitive Realm helps, too.

## [Entry #8](./t-1178/8)

#### Question

If a Shard were to divest itself from a planet, would the perpendicularity there disappear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Normally the shardpool would cease to exist, but there are circumstances that could prevent the shardpool from disappearing.

## [Entry #9](./t-1178/9)

#### Question

If a Shard were to divest itself from a planet, would the perpendicularity there disappear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Normally the shardpool would cease to exist, but there are circumstances that could prevent the shardpool from disappearing.

## [Entry #10](./t-1178/10)

#### Question

Is ReLuur's spike made of Atium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

hesitated a for a second RAFO. You get a card though. It's not that big of a spoiler, but the answer would bring up questions that are.

## [Entry #11](./t-1178/11)

#### Question

Are the Svrakiss cognitive shadows?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. But you expected that.

## [Entry #12](./t-1178/12)

#### Question

If you tapped blank Identity in an area, would you develop the area's accent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's part of what you need. You need to both blank your Identity and tap Connection to get the accent.

#### Footnote

Note: Sanderson interpreted this question as blanking identity. Also, I don't think tapping blank identity is a thing, so it was not a great question.

## [Entry #13](./t-1178/13)

#### Question

If Shai had a gold shadow, and she used one of her Essence Stamps, would her gold shadow change to reflect her new self?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, because she is changing her soul so the gold shadow changes.

## [Entry #14](./t-1178/14)

#### Question

If you were on Roshar, and tapped Connection, would you be unable to use Scadrial magic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, but that's a good question. You would not be able to use Selish magic though, because that is dependent on location.

## [Entry #15](./t-1178/15)

#### Question

Did Demoux achieve immortality by manipulating his Connection age?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Demoux uses the same method as most of the Seventeenth Shard. That method slows aging by a lot, but doesn't stop it completely.

## [Entry #16](./t-1178/16)

#### Question

During the events of Stormlight Archive, is Yolen still populated?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes... yes, I would say so since a letter is written to somebody on Yolen.

## [Entry #17](./t-1178/17)

#### Question

Was Leras bonded to a being in the Cognitive Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You mean like a Nahel bond? Yes, or a similar mechanism. Well, you have to remember that Shards interact with the realms in a different way, so... Well, I more mean before Leras became a Vessel. Anything before then is RAFO. (and I got a card)

## [Entry #18](./t-1178/18)

#### Question

You've mentioned before that Hoid ends up where he needs to be.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, and usually without knowing why.

#### Question

Is Chromium involved in that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Well, he's not necessarily using Chromium, but the underlying mechanic, yes.

## [Entry #19](./t-1178/19)

#### Question

Does Lift see Wyndle a different way than another Edgedancer would see their spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but only slightly. She sees a longer vine, and slightly more, but it's not a big difference.

## [Entry #20](./t-1178/20)

#### Question

Szeth refers to Nightblood as sword-nimi. What is the -nimi ending?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is an honorific.

#### Question

And why does he call it "sword", and not by its name?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It has not told him its name.

## [Entry #21](./t-1178/21)

#### Question

What kind of spren is Ivory?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Inkspren.

## [Entry #22](./t-1178/22)

#### Question

Does Damnation exist in all three Realms?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, all three.

## [Entry #23](./t-1178/23)

#### Question

Are odiumspren the only spren who live on Braize?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Only odiumspren are welcome on Braize, but they're different from anything we've seen so far.
