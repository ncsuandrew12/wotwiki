## Summary

## [Entry #1](./t-827/1)

#### Loialson

Only thing I got from him relevant to the Prologue was related to Cyndane.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Be cautious in judging what we see from the epilogue of
*Towers of Midnight*
regarding her, and other sources. All may not be as it seems. Trust not what we see from the readers perspective. Her POVs are reliable concerning her.

#### Loialson

He RAFOd if the one giving Isam orders was her or not.

"We are few, now,” Moridin said. “We four, and the one who is punished most, are all that remain."

#### Brandon Sanderson

The one who is punished most IS Cyndane/Lanfear.

#### Footnote

Cyndane has three POVs, all in
*Winter's Heart*
Chapter 35, "With the Choedan Kal". In those POVs she makes it clear that she is still angry with Rand for spurning her, and wants him to die.
