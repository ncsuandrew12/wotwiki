The apostrophe was a compounding device, though simple combination is used also. It also signifies a slight pause; a distinct break in the word, but less than the break between two words.

Adding an 'n' is one way to make a plural, with words ending in a vowel, but some words change form in plural and some are identical in plural and singular; including but not limited to most words that end in 'n' in the singular. The word
*mai*
means "maiden" or "maidens." One word for "spear" is
*dareis*
, but its plural is
*darei*
. Another way of making a plural is adding an 'i', as in
*shar*
—"blood" and
*Shari*
—"Bloods," or an 'in'—"seeker" is
*mahdi*
and "seekers" is
*mahdi'in*
. This is all of course complicated by the fact that some words change form depending on modifiers as well, and also sometimes to indicate increased importance (
*a'vron*
versus
*Ma'vron*
for "watchers").
