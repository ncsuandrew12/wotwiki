# [Interview #54, Entry #8]: Letter on the Old Tongue](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=54#8)

#### Robert Jordan

*Ye*
means "I."
*He*
is "sin,"
*she*
is "sar,"
*you*
is "asa," and
*it*
is "aso."

One of the difficulties is context and flexibility: for example,
*al*
can mean "the" or "of the." The word
*cuebiyar*
can mean simply "heart," or "my heart," or when capitalized, "the heart" as in the heart of a people or nation. The word
*moridin*
means "grave" or "tomb," but when capitalized it means "the grave," standing for "death." It is intended to be a language of subtlety, where the meanings of words can change to a great extent according to context. Remember Moiraine's comments on the difficulty of translation.

The Fourth Age titles are not Old Tongue, though influenced by it. Some common names are from the Old Tongue, and some aren't. Sorry I can't go into more detail, but we're talking a treatise.

Well. I am going to have to cut this off, now. Thanks for writing. Keep me posted on your deductions. One of these days, maybe I'll have time to give congratulations on the hits and point out the misses. One clue to some: sometimes when words are combined and the end of the first word is the same as the beginning of the second, they overlap.

With best wishes, I am,

Etc, etc.
