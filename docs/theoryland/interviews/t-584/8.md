#### Scott Wilson

Do you have a passion for short stories and have you had many published, and if so, what market did you send them to?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've had two science fiction short stories published, Defending Elysium in
*Asimov's Science Fiction*
and Firstborn on Tor.com. Both of my short stories are quite long, a bit shy of 15,000 words, and are technically novelettes. I can't compress my thoughts any farther. I guess I'm just a novelist at heart. That's the form I've practiced, and writing short stories is a very different art. I'm constantly in awe of what great short story writers (like my friend Eric James Stone) can do with just a few pages.
