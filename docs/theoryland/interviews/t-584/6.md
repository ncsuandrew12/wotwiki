#### Scott Wilson

What are you reading at the moment and who are your favorite authors?

#### Brandon Sanderson

At the moment sitting on my shelf next to be read is
*The Wee Free Men*
by Terry Pratchett. I also have a manuscript of
*Variant*
, a novel by a friend of mine, Robison Wells, which will will be coming out in a year or so from Harper Teen.

Favorite authors, in no particular order: Robert Jordan, Terry Pratchett, Victor Hugo, and Dan Wells. The list really depends on my mood at the time, who I've been reading a lot of recently. There are many authors from whom I'll love one book and not be as blown away by their other novels. Here's a sampling of single books I think are fantastic:
*A Fire Upon the Deep*
by Vernor Vinge,
*Dragonsbane*
by Barbara Hambly,
*Tigana*
by Guy Gavriel Kay, and
*Sabriel*
by Garth Nix.
