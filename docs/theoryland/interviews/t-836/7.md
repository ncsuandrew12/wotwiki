#### Question

Will there be an
*Alloy of Law*
2?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I really enjoyed writing it, and people seem to have enjoyed reading it, so I plan to do more. It was a really fun thing to do. You won't have to wait too long. I have to write the sequel to
*Way of Kings*
, which I'm doing right now, and then we'll see where I go.
