#### Question

So is there a third law of magic?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes there is. I don't have a pithy way to say it yet.

#### Question

Do you want to try to describe it anyways?

#### Brandon

Yeah, the best magic systems are interconnected with the world, with society, with culture, and the development of the setting of a book. The next level you want to think about is how does your magic affect your gender roles, how does it affect your government, your religions, all these things.

#### Question

They all have to be interconnected.

#### Brandon

Yes. But I don't have a pithy way to say it, so once I come up with a good pithy way to say it, then I can actually write it.
