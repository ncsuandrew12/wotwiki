Is that Chinese?

#### Gee Shu Pei

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Taiwan?

#### Gee Shu Pei

Yeah.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was just in Taiwan on tour.

#### Gee Shu Pei

Wow! Did they translate it there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. In fact I'm a bestseller there. I'm like John Grisham level in Taiwan of all the places. I sell really well here, but I sell crazy good in Taiwan and it's all teenage girls. [laughter erupts] They found Mistborn and fell in love with it. Like
*Hunger Games*
came out and Mistborn came out at the same time, and they all transferred to reading Mistborn as well, and so it's crazy. So I went over there and went on tour, and there's like 700 pictures of me with Taiwanese schoolgirls on Facebook. [laughter erupts again].
