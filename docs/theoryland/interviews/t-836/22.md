#### Question

Why is Dashiva never resurrected? He was killed with a ball of fire by Elza, not balefire....

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I know.

#### Loialson

Why is he dead?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Robert Jordan once said that res...transmigrating a soul had not just to do with the way that they were killed but the time and...not necessarily just a weave, but why and how. [Technically,
[where and how](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=43#5)
.] I am not going to delve too much into transmigration. Robert Jordan
[did speak](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#3)
on these sorts of things. And so, the Dark One also might not think that the person was an asset worth bringing back.

#### Loialson

Dashiva kinda sucks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not gonna say, but those are all factors in this.
