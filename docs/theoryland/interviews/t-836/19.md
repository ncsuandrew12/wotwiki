# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#19)

#### Bradley

[introduces self]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, Bradley. Any questions for me?

#### Bradley

Um, none that I feel won't get RAFO'd. Really, every possible question that I can think of is probably big enough that you're just going to say, "Wait until January." Which kind of hurts me inside, but at the same time, that's the way it's always been.

#### Fan

Ask it anyway.

#### Fan

Or at least for the recorder...

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's right. I'm being recorded for this so I can't tell too many secrets.

#### Bradley

That's true. Exactly.

#### Fan

That's the point. [...]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon: Well, the last book is actually...I gave into what I've been wanting to do all along, and I made it a crossover with
*Twilight*
. (laughter)

#### Bradley

Yes! See, I've always wanted that moment when it's got Nynaeve being awesome, and then Edward shows up and sparkles at her.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, right, well it's a meeting between Bella and Bela, right?

#### Fans

Ohhhh! (laughter)

#### Bradley

They're also both Darkfriends.

#### Fan

Bella rides on Bela? I can see it now.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep, yep...
