# [Interview #836, Entry #35]: Orem Signing Report - Zas](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#35)

#### Question

When are you going to write the last Alcatraz?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I bought the rights back from the publisher, I didn't like how they were being handled. That was February I think, and they have a six month sell off period till the rights officially reverted. So what's six months after February? We basically just got them officially back. And so I'm looking for trying to squeeze that in sometime next year.

#### Question

That's the one I want you to finish the most.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And once I get it done, I will probably just post it on my website for a digital download or something like that, just for the people who want it. Then we'll worry about how to get a print edition.
