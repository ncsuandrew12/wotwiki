# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#25)

#### Loialson

In the prologue, Isam is hired by a female that is not known. Is that Lanfear/Cyndane?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I'm TOTALLY gonna RAFO that. Come ON! Come on. You KNEW I was gonna RAFO that. That's very important to the book.

#### Loialson

Okay, related: Moridin says 'the one who is punished the most'. Obviously that's gotta be Cyndane, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay, yes. That is Cyndane.

#### Loialson

So, is it possible that what happened in the epilogue, she was really going through that torture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will have to see it. RAFO. Okay, like someone [?] related. I don't think, by the way...when you read the book, what Cyndane is up to should be of paramount importance to you, and DO NOT believe everything that you think happens in the book.

#### Loialson

From her point of view, or from our point of view?

#### Brandon Sanderson

From your point of view, regarding her.

#### Loialson

Oh, boy.
