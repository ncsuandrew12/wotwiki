# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#34)

#### Question

I heard you're doing another Mistborn Trilogy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Question

Any estimate when the first book might be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I might do some more
*Alloy of Law*
era things in between, they are not the second trilogy, but I will do them. The second trilogy will come between the break between the first sequence in the Stormlight Archive, and the second sequence of the Stormlight Archive. it's two five book sequences, and during that break I will stop and do the second Mistborn trilogy. So it will depend on how quickly I can write those.

#### Question

So when exactly would the second Mistborn trilogy take place relative to
*Alloy of Law*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Late 20th century era. Modern technology.

#### Zas

I've heard that's like... 50? years after
*Alloy of Law*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, right around there. Roughly. Not quite information age, is what I was looking at. So there's no direct equivalent, because the different technology aspects, but you would see it as something around the 80s. Maybe early 90s. Allomancer SWAT team is what it's about.

#### Question

Okay, that's exciting.

#### Brandon Sanderson

First book is a Mistborn serial killer versus an Allomancer SWAT team. With deeper ramifications to everything.

#### Question

Is Dan helping you with the psychology on that one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, I actually haven't yet gotten his help on a [profile?] yet.
