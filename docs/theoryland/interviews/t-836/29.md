# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#29)

#### Question

When is the next Stormlight Archive coming out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Next fall. If I'm on the ball. That's not supposed to rhyme, but it did. Tor said they'd put it out next fall if I turn it in on time.

#### Question

When is turn in time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

April. They said if I get it to them in April, we'll be fine. The trick is, for Michael Whelan to do the cover, I need to give him a cover scene like next month. Because Michael takes his time, because he's the best artist in the business, so you need to turn stuff in early. So I need to decide "What's the cover going to be", and come up with a fantastic cover scene for it.

#### Question

So is it finished? Is the book finished?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can follow on my website, I'm at 7% right now. I have to turn it in in April, so if I can get to 100% by April (or 110% knowing Brandon) we'll be all right. If we can't than it gets a little more sketchy.

#### Question

Is that turning in the first draft?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, we should be able to do it if I turn in the first draft in April.
