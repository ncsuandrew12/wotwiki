# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #45](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#45)

#### Zas

So where does the power of Allomancy come from? Does it come directly from Preservation? Does that imbalance him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Brandon being cautious about wording] Certain things built into a world are not the same. Not used in the same way. Meaning the energy of Preservation and Ruin inside of something living and growingâ€”yes that's "of" them, but that's not direct force that they're using at that time.

#### Adam

Would a good example of that be Allomancy versus the blessings the Kandra have?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah sure.
