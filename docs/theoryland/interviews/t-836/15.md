# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#15)

#### Question

I was wondering if you meant to do the arms thing in the beginning of Mistborn with Sazed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did, I did.

#### Question

K, good. I just wanted to make sure.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I feel kind of silly because it actually is a pun. And the entire Mistborn trilogy is therefore based on a pun. The first paragraph of the first chapter. But you know, if you can't tell from me naming my character Wax and Wayne, that I have a slight problem with puns.

#### Question

I love that! I didn't even realize it until I started to explain it to my family, and I was saying that the main characters are Wax and Wayne. It was a good moment.
