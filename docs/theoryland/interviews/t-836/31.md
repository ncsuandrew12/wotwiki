# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#31)

#### Question

I was wondering what your five favorite books are. Regardless of genre. I ask a lot of authors that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Les Miserables*
. That's one. That's my favorite classic.
*The Shadow Rising*
by Robert Jordan. Favorite of the WoT.
*Dragonsbane*
by Barbara Hambly. The book that got me into fantasy. It's hard to find nowadays.
*A Fire Upon The Deep Vernor Vinge*
. That's probably my favorite science fiction book. And let's say my favorite Pratchett, which these days is
*Going Postal*
.
