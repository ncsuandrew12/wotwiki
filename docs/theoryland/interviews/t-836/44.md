#### Josh and Eric

So are Shards the most powerful thing in the Cosmere?

#### Adam

Or is Adonalsium?

#### Josh and Eric

No, no, let him RAFO the first one first, or he'll lump them together.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on what you believe. The Shards are the most powerful things currently overtly manifest. There are those who would say there are other subtle forces being manifest. Most people in the know would say that Shards are the most powerful thing.

#### Adam

Does Hoid believe that Shards are the most powerful thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You'll have to ask him sometime. [gives troll grin]. Or see him get asked something like that sometime. There's argument to be made that right now Harmony is the most powerful thing in the Cosmere.
