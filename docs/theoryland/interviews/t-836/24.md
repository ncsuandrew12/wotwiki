# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#24)

#### Loialson

Mat's dice in his head. Are they real? Do they come from
*Sindhol*
? Are they from his
*ta'veren*
nature, or is it just a plot device? (laughter)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Everything that I've read in the notes indicates that they are from his
*ta'veren*
nature, and that they are a manifestation of being
*ta'veren*
[?] related to his [?]

#### Loialson

One of Perrin's manifestations, visions in the Wolf Dream...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Partially. Perrin's manifestation is also...he draws to him things that he needs; what he needs comes to Perrin. That's actually his primary manifestation of being
*ta'veren*
.

#### Loialson

So what's the difference between what Perrin does and what Egwene does?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh boy. Can I get into this? They are similar, but not the same. What Egwene does is partially a Talent of the Power, and it's related to the Power. And Perrin is not.

#### Loialson

Is it [?] him being a Wolfbrother?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Loialson

[?] if he chose to.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is related to him being a Wolfbrother.

#### Loialson

Why can the wolves not see it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I honestly don't remember the answer to that.

#### Loialson

That's okay...
