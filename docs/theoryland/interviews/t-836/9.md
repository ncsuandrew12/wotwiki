# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#9)

#### Fan

I'm so excited for the
*Way of Kings*
sequel.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, you'll be glad to know that I finished with the first section of it last night; the second book is Shallan's book, so I was writing her flashback sequences.

#### Question

Any new name ideas yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not yet. The name's still the Bad Name. [explains to others]. In my notes it's called
*The Book of Endless Pages*
, because that's the book Shallan gets at the end of Book 1, but the problem is that it's kind of a silly title for a book this long.
