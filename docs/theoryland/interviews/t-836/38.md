#### q

I love the cross interviews between you and Patrick Rothfuss. They're some of my favorites.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah, yeah. I'm doing another thing with him, like next month, in just a couple weeks. He does this thing on Google Hangouts, and he invited me on for the next one.

#### Question

What's that called?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's like something he does...

#### Zas

Story Board?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. So I'll be doing that with Terry Brooks, it'll be me and him and Terry Brooks. It's going to be pretty cool.
