# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #32](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#32)

#### Question

We were at the RPG release party and I gave that to my friend for his wedding, because he's really into that. He actually sent me with a couple questions. He said â€˜could you ask him about the Words of Founding? What does it contain besides the religions, technological advancements, and layout for Elendel? Is there anything special in there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There's some other cool stuff in there that eventually I'll talk about.

#### Question

But nothing specific?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nothing I'm going to be able to (can't tell what he's saying. Basically that he can't say anything specific, I think.

#### Question

I was going to say generalities. Does that cover the basics of it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That definitely covers the basics of it, yeah. There was stuff from Sazed's metalminds. A lot of that stuff that was in there. Everything that was in there, he tried to get in the books. And then some other additions. Such as Elendel, which he created as a basin for life and things. And stuff like that. They are very interesting. These guys are here recording everything I have to say. So I have to watch myself.
