#### Question

[So in the
*Alloy of Law*
, you mention it being an in between book. You said you're writing] another Trilogy set?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. I had this whole series that was outlined. This [
*Alloy of Law*
] was not in the outline, it was from fun, and I really enjoyed writing it, but it's not part of the series. It's three sets of three. And I may do other things like
*Alloy of Law*
, but
*Alloy*
was just for fun.

I don't know if you know this, but all my fantasy books are connected. There are repeating characters involved, but you have to search to find them. And the Mistborn Trilogy is kind of interconnected with that. Particularly with the third trilogy. The Science Fiction one.
