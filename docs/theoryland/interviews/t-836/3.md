# [Interview #836, Entry #3]: Orem Signing Report - Zas](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#3)

#### Question

I have to admit, I've read everything except for your Wheel of Time books, because I'm having a hard time getting through book 11, I lose track of all the characters, and the plot.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know how you feel. If you ever decide that you want to get back in them, there is the WoT Encyclopedia which has chapter summaries for all the books, so you can jump right into book 12. There's another one called WoT summary that's very good too.

#### Question

What's the release date? January 3rd?

#### Brandon Sanderson

January 8th. Or 9th.

#### Zas

8th.

#### Brandon

8th. These guys know better than I do.
