# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#23)

#### Loialson

Was the original intention of the Eye of the World to be a second option to reseal the Bore?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as I know, no. Now, that's the sort of thing that could be buried in the notes, but you know, I've read a lot of them, and as far as I know, no, that's not the purpose.

#### Loialson

Did the makers originally have a specific intention? Because I don't think Rand used it in the way they intended.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that they did have a specific intention.

#### Loialson

Did Rand use it alright, to their intentions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, Rand...um...

#### Loialson

That felt like a big waste to me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah. I was...I will RAFO that. But I will say that they did have a specific intention. How about, here's something I can give you...it's actually
[backing up a few questions](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#21)
. I've mentioned online that we're probably going to—for a certain anthology, the
*Unfettered*
anthology—we are going to be putting deleted scenes from
*A Memory of Light*
and some of these deleted scenes will answer some of your questions.

#### Loialson

That's exciting. Thank you.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't think there's an official announcement; I don't think Harriet has decided 100% to make the announcement, but I've mentioned online before in things that we were considering it, and so, some deleted scenes having to do with some of your questions are actually going to be in this
*Unfettered*
anthology, and they may be from the viewpoint of a certain Forsaken that everyone's very curious about.
