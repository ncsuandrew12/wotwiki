# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #51](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#51)

#### Zas

That's it. Oh wait, we can do this ridiculous one. There's this crazy off the wall theory that Parshendi are dead people brought back to life.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Interesting. There will be Parshendi viewpoints in the second book, and you will be able to see a lot more of that.

#### Question

Are Parshendi like a hive mind sort of culture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are not a hive mind. I thought people might assume that.

#### Question

But because of the singing, it seems like...

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a connection. It's more Union than Hivemind. You know about Jung?

#### Question

Not particularly.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Jung's philosophy was that all people are connected.

#### Question

Oh, like the dream psychologist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I believe that collective unconscious was one of his terms. So it's not hive mind, but there isâ€”there's something the Parshendi can tap into.

#### Question

With the singing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, like with the singing, where one sings over here, and one sings over there, they are actually in beat with one another even if they start at different times. So there is something there, a connection.
