# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#20)

#### Loialson

Question from Travyl, at the reread: Did Rand tell Darlin what Darlin responded to Egwene's letter, or was that all Darlin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### Loialson

Dangit.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't want to say anything about that because there's a potential confrontation coming up between all of these folks, and so there may be mention made of what various people knew and didn't know.

#### Loialson

Okay.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not a big RAFO—it's not like there's some big secret there—but I don't want to say anything that's going to spoil a potential read of scenes that are coming.
