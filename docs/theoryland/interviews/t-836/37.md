# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#37)

#### Question

How do you come up with your magic systems? Do you just open the dictionary and point to a word? "Oh, I'll make something with that."

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I'm always looking for something that strikes me. And I'm looking for things that haven't been done before. Things that will make nice conflict, that walk the line between science and superstition.

#### Question

That's what I love, that it's all super scientific but it also has magic.

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you will Google Sanderson's First Law, and Sanderson's Second Law, I have two essays that I wrote about how I do magic. They're both on my website, but Google will find them easier than trying to find them on my website.

#### Question

Did you ever read Master of 5 magics?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I did. That's old school.

#### Question

Yeah, not great stories, but wonderful magic.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep. Great magic. That's what I felt about them too.

#### Question

When will the next Mistborn (
*Alloy of Law*
era) come out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will probably come out after the next
*Way of Kings*
. Next
*Way of Kings*
is next Christmas, the next
*Alloy of Law*
era book is probably the following Spring or something like that.

#### Question

Are you planning two more or three more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I will do as many of those as strikes me. The
*Alloy of Law*
books are a deviation from the main world plotline.

So it's just for fun. I'm not going to commit to how many I'll do or not do. Just whatever's working.
