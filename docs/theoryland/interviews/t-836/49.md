# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #49](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#49)

#### Zas

So the number of Shards that have been on Roshar is three, correct?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Correct.

#### Zas

People have been thrown by you saying that Odium is not native to Roshar.

#### Brandon

Odium is not native, that's the thing. Are any of them native? So if you dig the deeper question, are any of them native, ehhh, none of them are native to the planets you've seen so far. What I probably should've said to be more precise is that Honor and Cultivation were there long before Odium showed up.
