# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#16)

#### Question

So you said that you recently threw away a sequence from
*Way of Kings*
2. How do you know when to throw it out?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Practice. Lots of practice. It was much harder to do that early on, but I've had lots of practice, and so I know that when it's not working, I know why it's not working. Sometimes when it's not working it's because I'm just having a bad day. I need to try it the next day. Sometimes when it's not working, Something fundamental is wrong with the book. Sometimes, it's just the scene is in the wrong place or isn't active enough. And this one wasn't active enough. I set it in a way that people were just sitting around too much, and I had to scrap all that rework it so that there would be conflict and motion.
