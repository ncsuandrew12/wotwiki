# [Interview #836: Orem Signing Report - Zas, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=836#21)

#### Loialson

Does Demandred even have an alter ego?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, he does.

#### Loialson

Okay, cause we've been trying to figure out who the heck is it, and we can't figure it out. We're thinking Roedran, but it's like, too obvious.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's the thing: Robert Jordan said that Demandred did not appear until
*Knife of Dreams*
, and so I have been very hesitant about saying whether or not he'd appeared—I think I've said whether or not he'd appeared on screen in my books—but the reason is, if I give you a yes or no—if he's appeared, yes or no—then that narrows it down to like just a few characters, that are introduced in mine, so I've been very hesitant about answering that. Demandred does have an alter ego. He has been up to some very cool things. There are people online who have guessed correctly. And so, I will say that much.

#### Loialson

Is he in Randland?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I won't say whether or not he's in Randland.

#### Fan

He's not in Shara! He can't be in Shara!

#### Footnote

As to whether or not Demandred's alter ego has been seen on screen, Brandon himself

RJ's comment through
*Knife of Dreams*
, and he later
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=571#7)
that Demandred wasn't seen in
*Towers of Midnight*
at all. That, combined with this comment here where he lumps his books together makes it clear that
**Demandred's alter ego has never been seen on screen.**
(A
[list](http://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=The_Gathering_Storm_Character_List#First_Appearance)
of characters introduced in
*The Gathering Storm*
, some of whom are disqualified by appearing in
*Towers of Midnight*
, helps to make that point.) Other
[comments](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=139#3)
by RJ make it clear that
**we should be able to figure out who it is by
*Winter's Heart*
at the latest**
, and Brandon has also
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#23)
[several](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=773#4)
[times](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#44)
that it can be figured out from the books.
