## Entry #1

#### mrc1ark

I asked Brandon about the balefire and Min's bruises tonight at the DC book signing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that he, Harriet, and Maria discussed them and decided they should stay. Semirhage got balefired, not Rand, and Rand made the bruises therefore bruises stay. Thats according to the source. So even if you disagree with those rules that seems to be the way it will be interpreted for the last two books. Sanderson did admit that things with balefire were tricky.

## Entry #2

#### mrc1ark

I asked Brandon about [the destruction of the Choedan Kal] tonight at the DC signing because it bugged me too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson said Rand realized that he did not need the Choedan Kal for the Last Battle. He also said that Rand was not at a point where he needed the Choedan Kal for anything he wanted to do.

#### mrc1ark

He said the sentence in a way that leads me to believe post epiphany Rand is much stronger than pre epiphany Rand though that is my interpretation of his sentence.

#### Brandon Sanderson

On the subject of the Choedan Kal, he said that the True Power was not as strong as someone with the Choedan Kal. Just it felt as tempting and as addictive as the One Power through the Choedan Kal.
