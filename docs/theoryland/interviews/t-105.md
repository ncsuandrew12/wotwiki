## [Entry #1](./t-105/1)

#### Ray Chason

My question at the Bailey's Crossroads signing (21 Nov 1998) was:

Lews Therin wore the Ring of Tamyrlin. Who or what was this named for?

#### Robert Jordan

Ah, Read And Find Out.

#### Ray Chason

I didn't quite expect that. I thought this question was so far removed from the plot that Hizzoner wouldn't mind answering it. Furthermore, I had hoped to settle some of the local Looney Theories on this topic, most of which sound like just that to me. But he said something about patterns of speculation that he didn't want us getting into just yet.
