# [Interview #828, Entry #1]: TEOTW Signing Report - The Fisher King](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=828#1)

This report was made over 20 years after the signing itself. When The Fisher King said he'd met RJ on the tour for
*The Eye of the World*
, I asked him if he would be willing to write up a report. We don't have any reports from the early tours at all, so I figured a dated report would be better than nothing.
