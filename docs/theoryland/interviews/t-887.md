For those who missed the news and are wondering about the

.

On this week's episode of the Writing Excuses podcast, Mary, Howard, Dan, and I discuss
[the Hero's Journey](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2013/01/13/)
. This is an episode that we've talked about doing for years and have finally gotten around to. Enjoy!

## [Entry #4](./t-887/4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

For Mistborn fans, World of Warcraft is adding a "Survivor's Bag of Coins" to the 5.2.0 patch. See details
[here](http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94154-survivors-bag-of-coins)
. I think this is awesome! (Also note that the Mistborn action RPG
[*Mistborn: Birthright*](http://www.mistborngame.com/)
is still in development, but right now it looks like the release might get pushed back to 2014 instead of this year. There hasn't been an official announcement though.)

On my tour I've been stopping to sign books in airport bookstores as usual. Years ago some of my fans nicknamed this "Brandalizing." Grammar Girl did a quick
[blog post](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/brandalized.aspx)
about the term this week.

Here's a video of Harriet reading
[the wind scene](http://twitter.yfrog.com/jadfenegbybbzwloxdvqocpaz)
from
*A Memory of Light*
at our signing this past weekend at the College of Charleston. Thanks, Jessica Crout! The Addlestone Library there is the home of
[Robert Jordan's papers](http://blogs.cofc.edu/thetruesource/)
. They had on display this very early draft of
*The Eye of the World*
with Jordan's handwritten edits on it. (Sorry my photo is so blurry.)

Last week I appeared on Wired's Geek's Guide to the Galaxy podcast
[talking about
*A Memory of Light*](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/01/geeks-guide-brandon-sanderson/)
. And
*USA Today*
had a cool
[Robert Jordan sidebar in the paper](http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/01/09/robert-jordan-memory-of-light/1818227/)
. Here's a photo:

My assistant has also uploaded two more Twitter archive posts. [Assistant Peter's note: The
[first one](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/119/Tweets-December-31-2012-January-9-2013)
is spoiler free, but there are plenty of spoilers for
*A Memory of Light*
in the
[second one](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/120/Tweets-January-9-13-2013)
. Brandon tries to keep spoilers out of his Twitter feed, but there are major spoilers in several of the questions that Brandon answered.]

We'll find out how
*A Memory of Light*
did on the
*New York Times*
bestseller list later today or tomorrow, but we already know it hit #1 on the Ingram and National Indie lists. (The
*USA Today*
listing above was for the week before the book came out.) We also made Shelf Awareness's Image of the Day for
[January 16th](http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=1907#m18660)
, which you can see here (taken at Joseph-Beth in Lexington):

Thanks for all of your support, and I hope you're enjoying the book! It has been an honor.
