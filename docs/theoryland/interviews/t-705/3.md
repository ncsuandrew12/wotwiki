Then he answered a lot of questions, on what it is to be a writer, how the whole Wheel of Time deal went (including a hilarious description of the day Harriet called him) and so on.

He called out through the whole room "Is there a guy called X here?" and when that guy replied, Brandon just shouted "Your friend Adam wants you to know that you just lost the game." Half the room nearly died from geek overdose.
