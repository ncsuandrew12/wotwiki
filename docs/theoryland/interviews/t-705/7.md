# [Interview #705: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Tortellini, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=705#7)

#### Tortellini

There was more, but I can't really remember anything major. Finally, I came up and got to ask my questions. Since I started the thread about outposts and stone bridges, I felt like getting some input there.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon told me that single highprinces could not erect outposts because due to the superior mobility of the Parshendiâ€”they would overwhelm any small outpost quickly. Soulcasting stone bridges is also not plausible. Apparently, they would need to first get the wooden bridge out there, then soulcast it and then, since the stone is heavier than the wood, they would have to reinforce it, e.g. with ropes. These could then be cut by the Parshendi, so it would not help at all. Dalinar with his mobile bridges is on a better track in his opinion. He did say however that several highprinces working together could easily establish outposts in the Plains. He said the competitive nature of the Alethi was doing them a huge disservice in the war and that if they would work together, they could have taken the Plains long ago.
