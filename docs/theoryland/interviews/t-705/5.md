#### Tortellini

Someone asked if it were hard to write Jasnah, an atheist character, for a devout Christian.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon said he read a lot of atheist message boards for inspiration. Also, it sounded like he'd had the character in his head for a while, but hadn't found the right book to put it inâ€”e.g. he said it would make no sense to put an atheist in a world where gods walk around (i.e.
*Warbreaker*
).
