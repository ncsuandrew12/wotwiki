# [Interview #705: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Tortellini, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=705#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He read from an unpublished work he's writing for an anthology of GRRM tentatively titled "Dangerous Women". It was something he worked on for the trip, and it was quite funny and very promising. No spoilers from me on this one, all I will say is that it doesn't seem cosmere-related and that the White Fox is one dangerous dude... Looking forward to reading that in full!
