# [Interview #705: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Tortellini, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=705#9)

#### Tortellini

The evening also included Brandon kicking ass at Magic, which was quite spectacular to see. I have never seen anyone play 3 Hypnotic Specters and then lose so definitely... All in all, a great evening and some new ideas to dissect.
