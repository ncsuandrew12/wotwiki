## [Entry #1](./t-656/1)

#### Robert Jordan

At a recent RJ event in Australia, I actually asked RJ about reversing a circle-induced turning to the Dark and got the (somewhat predictable) RAFO.

#### DONALD LOWE

Given the number of mentions this has gotten in the book, one suspects someone/s will forcibly be turned to the dark ... whether they can be
"unturned" remains to be seen. Has anyone speculated on
*why*
a channeler is susceptible?

cheers

This image is courtesy of Linda Taglieri, and taken years later when Brandon also signed the book. This is the only signing report from Sydney, so here it goes.
