#### Bill Thompson

It is a mistake to view "The Wheel of Time" cycle as a series. Rather like Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings," to which it is most often compared, "The Wheel of Time" is a single novel built of multiple books.

#### Robert Jordan

"I'm doing something that hasn't been done, I guess, since (English novelist Anthony) Trollope. I am writing a very long, multivolume novel. You can read the first book,
*The Eye of the World*
, and stop, and feel you've read something that has enough resolution that you don't feel you have to read more. But you still have to start there."

#### Bill Thompson

Jordan cautions readers not to attempt to pick up the story in midstream, much less get one's feet wet with the most recent volume. Not until one has read books one through nine.

#### Robert Jordan

"You cannot start by reading
*Crossroads of Twilight*
. If you do you will be bitterly disappointed. In ten pages you'll give up. You have to start with
*The Eye of the World*
, which has been continuously in print in hardcover for 13 years. There aren't many books that can match that."
