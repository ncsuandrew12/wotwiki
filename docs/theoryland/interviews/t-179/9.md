#### Bill Thompson

Very occasionally, Jordan meets a reader who believes the author is imbued with some arcane potential, that the ability to channel the One Power is not only an actual faculty, but something he can teach them to do.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan chuckles, ruefully.

"I have more often met people—just as frightening in a way—who think because of these books I am some sort of guru or sage, and that they can learn great wisdom from me. I just write books. I tell stories, that's all. The books demand as much as the reader is willing to give them. My main concern is to write them in such a way that they will not merely stand up to repeated readings, but still offer something the second time through, or the fifth."
