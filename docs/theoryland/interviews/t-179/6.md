When "The Wheel of Time" stops turning, Jordan will not lack for fodder. He's already been pondering a new project for the past seven or eight years.

#### Robert Jordan

"There's nothing on paper yet, but a load of stuff in the back of my head. It will be very different. Another fantasy, but in a different world, a completely different universe with completely different characters. It will not in any way be a sequel, or even related to 'The Wheel of Time,' except that it also will go into the clash of cultures, the meeting of cultures that are widely different, a subject which has always fascinated me."

#### Bill Thompson

And the prospect excites him. The depth and detail will be there; it's how he writes. But the prodigious length? No. He is trying to plan how to structure this new set of books so that it can be done in six volumes.
