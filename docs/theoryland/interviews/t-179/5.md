#### Bill Thompson

The 11th book, thus far untitled, is due out in late 2004, or perhaps early 2005. Meanwhile, Jordan is at work expanding an earlier tale.

#### Robert Jordan

"I wrote a novella called 'New Spring' for a collection that was put together by Robert Silverberg for an anthology called
*Legends*
. I had to compress the story quite a bit to get it down to novella length. I happened to mention to my publisher that had I put everything I had wanted into the story, it would have been twice the length. He asked if I'd be interested in rewriting it as a novel. So I'm going to do that. It's in progress now. I hope to have it finished in a few more months."
