## [Entry #1](./t-43/1)

#### Ted Herman

The second signing session of the day was local, just a short drive up a rainy, traffic filled highway. This one had a Q&A session also, same restrictions on autographs though (two hardcovers, no personalization per trip in line). RJ seemed like he wanted to get going quickly for an early trip to the next stop tomorrow, so I only went through the line once.

#### Robert Jordan

In the Q&A, everyone was using the same questions that are answered in just about every Q&A RJ does, or at least recently: about writing female POVs, about compiling his notes, how does he store all the info about the plots and characters, etc... He did give some new info/answers on a couple of topics. He did repeat the tidbit about writing additional side stories that was on Wotmania today. He mentioned that he hates Apple computers because the early versions were not compatible with each other :p He mentioned if a mini series is done on NBC, there might be other sequel series on showtime or sci-fi channel.

## [Entry #2](./t-43/2)

#### Question

There were two plot related questions in the Q&A, both were RAFO'd: Did Aviendha's gateway in beginning of
*The Path of Daggers*
go back in time?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

## [Entry #3](./t-43/3)

#### Ted Herman

Is the One Power infinite and what is it composed of (my question)?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

## [Entry #4](./t-43/4)

#### Ted Herman

Got to ask two questions at signing part:

Who killed Alric?

#### Robert Jordan

One of the Aes Sedai's Warders did, not a sister.

#### Footnote

Alric was Siuan Sanche's Warder who was killed when she was deposed in
*The Shadow Rising*
.

## [Entry #5](./t-43/5)

#### Ted Herman

Since you said at an earlier signing that the Dark One couldn't have brought back Asmodean if he wanted, was that at the time of Asmodean's death, or after that?

#### Robert Jordan

The Dark One couldn't bring back Asmodean because of the combination of two factors: HOW HE DIED and WHERE HE DIED. Not one or the other, both factors.

#### Footnote

The referred to
[earlier question](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=152#6)
was asked at the NYC Barnes & Noble signing on the
*Crossroads of Twilight*
tour.

## [Entry #6](./t-43/6)

#### Ted Herman

Oh, and Camel? He had "the" hat :lol (at the first signing anyway)
