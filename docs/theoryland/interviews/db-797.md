## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right now I'm in Las Vegas for this year's edition of the
[Superstars Writing Seminar](http://www.superstarswritingseminars.com/)
where I'm an instructor. I posted about this several times over the last few months, so I hope it's not a surprise to anyone!

[Hal-Con](http://hal-con.com/)
in Halifax, Nova Scotia has been added to my
[events calendar](http://brandonsanderson.com/events)
for October this year. I'm looking forward to meeting lots of Canadian readers! That should be my final convention for 2012, and then will come the book tour in January, which is in the planning stages. For my current schedule as it stands, see the previous link.

## Entry #2

The most recent Writing Excuses podcast episode is another one that was recorded in front of a live audience at Life, the Universe & Everything. It features
[James A. Owen](http://www.heretherebedragons.net/)
talking with Dan, Mary, Howard, and me about
[discovering your voice](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/04/29/)
.

## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
annotation covers one of my favorite chapters, number
[eleven](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/455/Alcatraz-Chapter-Eleven)
. It's the one where Alcatraz talks about how authors like to torture people. But that's not what makes it one of my favorites.

Also, in case anyone missed it last week when I mentioned it on
[Twitter and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
, Tor.com has put up the
[excerpt of the prologue to
*A Memory of Light*](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/04/a-memory-of-light-prologue-excerpt)
that Harriet read recently at JordanCon. As for the rest of the book, we are still hard at work on revisions.](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)

## Entry #5

My former student Scott Ashton posted another of my class lectures. This one is about
[characterization](http://www.writeaboutdragons.com/home/brandon_w2012/lecture-4/)
. There's also an
[email group](http://www.writeaboutdragons.com/home/brandon_w2012/)
for people who want to recreate the entire class experience online.
