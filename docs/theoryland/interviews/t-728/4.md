# [Interview #728: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#4)

#### Aidan Moher

What did writing
*The Gathering Storm*
teach you that made
*Towers of Midnight*
a better book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Two things: First, how to juggle a large number of plotlines and viewpoints. (Something I'd failed at in drafts of unpublished books during my earlier years as a writer.) I couldn't afford not to do this well.

Second, I believe I learned a lot about character viewpoint and narrative. (Most of this came from reading Mr. Jordan's books with a much more detailed eye than I'd done in recent years.)
