# [Interview #728: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#5)

#### Aidan Moher

*Towers of Midnight*
is reputedly a very Mat Cauthon-heavy book. One of the criticisms leveled at
*The Gathering Storm*
was that you had trouble capturing Mat's very distinct voice and personality. Do you feel like you have a better handle on Mat now that you're a volume into your tenure with The Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. See above.
