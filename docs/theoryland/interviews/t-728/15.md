# [Interview #728: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#15)

#### Aidan Moher

I always like to ask the folk who drop by to name a few of the authors they feel are criminally under-read. Who do you wish more readers would discover and why should we be reading them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I've mentioned
[Daniel Abraham](http://www.danielabraham.com/)
before. I think his series was under-read. Many fewer people now days know
[Melanie Rawn](http://www.melanierawn.com/)
's Sunrunner series, which was—I think—foundational in the movement toward science-based magic systems, like I enjoy writing. And I'm sure my buddy
[Dan Wells](http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/)
wouldn't complain about some more readers. His books are truly brilliant. (He's not poorly read, but he's new, so a lot of people haven't discovered his books yet.)
