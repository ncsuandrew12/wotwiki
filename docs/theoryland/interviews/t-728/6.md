# [Interview #728, Entry #6]: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#6)

#### Aidan Moher

You're known for creating very intricate and logical magic systems in your novel; what was it like jumping into a magic system already established and created by another author?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, considering that the Wheel of Time's magic system was a foundational inspiration for the way I do magic systems, I'd say this wasn't actually as big a problem as one might assume. Yes, Mr. Jordan does some things with magic very differently than I do. But his use of an underlying logic, mixed with excellent visual imagery and a science to the magic, is part of what I've long loved about the series.

The biggest trouble for me has been remembering which specific combinations of which specific powers create which specific weaves.
