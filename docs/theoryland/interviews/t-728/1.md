# [Interview #728, Entry #1]: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#1)

#### Aidan Moher

The
[last time I interviewed](http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2007/09/interviews/interview-brandon-sanderson/)
[Brandon Sanderson](http://brandonsanderson.com/)
, he'd just released his third novel,
*The Well of Ascension*
and was putting his teeth to the grindstone and trying to establish himself in the Fantasy genre. Boy how things can change in just a few years.

Now, he's the guy holding the reins of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series and carries all the weight of its finale on his shoulders. Luckily, if there's anything Sanderson's known for, it's being able to write some of the
[best conclusions](http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2009/10/reviews/review-the-hero-of-ages-by-brandon-sanderson/)
in the genre.

What's more amazing is that he's not only managed to publish two Wheel of Time novels in two years, he's also published a 1,000 page novel,
*The Way of Kings*
, from a new Fantasy series called The Stormlight Archive. The dude's prolific and the quality never seems to dip. So, enjoy the interview, and thank him for staying up into the deep parts of the night, just hours before one of the most important novels of his career is launched, to complete an interview with silly old me. Few gentlemen still exist in the world, but Brandon Sanderson's certainly among their number.
