Thanks, Brandon. It was an absolute pleasure! Best of luck with

and your endless supply of other future projects!

Thanks! Let me throw out an apology for typos, awkward writing, etc. Doing this at 2:00am the night before I start the
*Towers of Midnight*
craziness. Hope I didn't embarrass myself too much. :)
