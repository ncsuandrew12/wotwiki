# [Interview #728: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#14)

#### Aidan Moher

Your life has changed drastically over the last five years. Do you ever look back fondly on those days of being an aspiring writer, fighting to be heard above the white noise of the industry but with complete creative freedom?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I do remember them with fondness. I don't remember fondly the struggles to pay bills, the long hours working a graveyard shift, or the sometimes dizzying level of uncertainty in my life. But I do sometimes wish I had the freedom I had then. I still pretty much get to write what I want when I want, but there are limits to that. And I have a LOT more interruptions now. The realities of having a career, not a hobby.
