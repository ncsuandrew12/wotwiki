# [Interview #728, Entry #8]: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#8)

#### Aidan Moher

Is there anything that Jordan wrote into the earlier novels that causes you to grind your teeth? If you could change one small thing from earlier in the series, what would it be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, wow. You know, I've never thought about that before. I believe Robert Jordan himself said he'd have done Book Ten differently, if he had to do it over again. (Though I've never been a large book ten hater.) Honestly...I'd probably cut a spanking scene or two. :)
