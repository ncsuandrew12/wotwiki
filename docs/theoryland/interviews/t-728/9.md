#### Aidan Moher

So, ahh, Joar Addam Nesossin is just chillin' out in a shady spot by a cool stream, relaxing and, of course, reading
*Towers of Midnight*
to find out about Moiraine when a shadow falls over him.

He looks up and says, "You? No!"

Who, uhh...might've cast that shadow that interrupted poor Joar's reading session?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're actually the first one to ask me about Asmodean with regards to his real name. Nice.
