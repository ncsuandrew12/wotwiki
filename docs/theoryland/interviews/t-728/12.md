# [Interview #728: Interview with Brandon Sanderson - A Dribble of Ink, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=728#12)

#### Aidan Moher

You're known for writing big, juicy Fantasy trilogies and, now, 10-volume series. Even
*Elantris*
, originally released as a standalone, has a couple of planned sequels. What is it about these intricate, multi-volume stories that appeals to you so much as a writer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wish I could answer that directly. It's just how I work. Those are the types of stories I love to read, so those are the types of stories I love to write. I believe it's something that the novel form can do that is more difficult in other forms of entertainment. Even television, with its more long-form storytelling methods, can't generally approach the kind of large-scale epicness that a long series can.
