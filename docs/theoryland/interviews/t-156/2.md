#### Robert Jordan

Robert Jordan starts off by "answering a few questions". He starts with a whole slew of pronunciations ... let's see if I remember them all:

Aviendha—Ahh-vee-en-duh

Nynaeve—Nigh-neeve

Aes Sedai—Eye-said-eye / Eye-suh-die

*Saidin*
—Sigh-deen

*Saidar*
—Sigh-dar

Seanchan—Shawn-chan or Shawn-chawn (I can't remember which sadly)

Egwene—Eh-gwain / Egg-wain (He was irritated at this one.)

Tar Valon—Tar-val-on (I believe, I seriously can't remember.)
