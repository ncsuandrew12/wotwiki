What did we miss that would have told us who killed Asmodean?

I don't think people missed it. RJ said it was obvious, and many guessed it correctly. So I'd say they got it.

If you ask on a fan site, they can get you the 'Sherlock Holmes' style investigation of the subject. It is right.

Was Asmodean killed with balefire? And when will additional details regarding his death be released?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1718914736197632)

I will see if I can give additional details. I'll ask Maria and Harriet for their read.
