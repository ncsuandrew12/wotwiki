Are the prophecies competing a la
*The Belgariad*
(by David Eddings), or are they complementary?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 November 2010)](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1719523350675456)

Not competing like
*The Belgariad*
, and certainly not intelligent like in
*The Belgariad*
.

Some may be interpreted wrong, others may be recorded wrong, but there is not a this/that nature to them.
