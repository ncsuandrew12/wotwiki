Ch. 48-49. Was that all in Jordan's notes? So so sad and dark!

I'm avoiding answering questions about what was specifically in the notes and what wasn't, for now.

Ok, well, can you comment on your own feelings of those chapters, as a fan?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/1713185094631424)

Awesome but very disturbing. As a fan, they're discomforting.
