# [Interview #970: Literate Liquors Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=970#3)

#### John Hartness

And I basically accosted Brandon in the hallway as we were leaving the JordanCon party and said, "Do you have ten minutes?" I've used four of them already.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I've accosted my share of people for the podcast idea. So I'm used to this. We sometimes tie people up and tow them over.

#### John Hartness

Yes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"You podcast with us, or we won't let you go."

#### John Hartness

And I do have Scott W. Baker from episode two times ago in the room. And Scott's another big dude, so between us we could probably have manhandled him. It's not like a James Tuck, or anything, but . . . Anyway, so Brandon what project am I currently keeping you from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Wheel of Timeâ€“the last book of The Wheel of Time.
*A Memory of Light*
comes out January 8. I am going to go to my hotel room and work on it some more because the deadlines are pretty crazy.

#### John Hartness

How well I know, 'cause my deadlines are two weeks ago for revisions on book two of my series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah. And here we are sitting and chatting instead.
