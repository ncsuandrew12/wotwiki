# [Interview #970: Literate Liquors Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=970#4)

#### John Hartness

Yes. So this is book twenty-seven?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, four hundred and thirty. No, it's book fourteen.

#### John Hartness

Book fourteen.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is the last one, though. For those who were skeptical, it really, really is. This is the end.

#### John Hartness

You know, J. K. Rowling said that once.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh yeah? But then . . . she's not writing more Harry Potter is she? She's doing, like, some other thing.

#### John Hartness

There's this nasty rumor that there's another Potter book coming.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh really?

#### John Hartness

But, I have not heard it confirmed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, you know, when they make four hundred gazillion dollars, maybe she needs to go buy another continent.

#### John Hartness

Right, like Australia's not enough.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, yeah. You need a couple more continents, what are you going to do? You gotta write another book, right?

#### John Hartness

Absolutely.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You only own one private fleet. I mean, the Queen has three. How can she show her face at parties?

#### John Hartness

Seriously. By the way, if any of Ms. Rowling's people are out there, we would love to have her on Writing Excuses and Literate Liquors . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

At the same time.

#### John Hartness

At the same time, because I'm pretty sure that she'd have to get liquored up to hang out with us.

#### Brandon Sanderson

We could do it on your private fleet. It would be great . . . we could sail to your continent.
