# [Interview #970: Literate Liquors Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=970#5)

#### John Hartness

So you're working on the last Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am.

#### John Hartness

How does that feel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It feels really scary.

#### John Hartness

Yeah?

#### Brandon Sanderson

And well, really awesome. It's the whole thing: scary, awesome, and daunting. I don't know what to say other than that. I mean, it's the last book. Iâ€™ve been following this thing since I was fourteen or fifteen . . . whatever, 1990.

#### John Hartness

Wow . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've been reading them ever since then, reading them since they came out. It's like the Wheel of Time has been the one constant throughout my entire life.

#### John Hartness

You weren't able to drive . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, I wasn't able to drive when I started reading the Wheel of Time, and now I'm almost 40, and so . . . yeah.

#### John Hartness

So am I, and I look a good ten years older than him. This is why I have much more encyclopedic knowledge of alcohol. Clean living (points to Brandon). Literate Liquors (points to self). So, that's awesome, and we did just come from the JordanCon party. So this thing . . . it's not even just a series of books.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### John Hartness

It's a whole culture. It's a con, it's . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

People are into Wheel of Time in the same way that people get into Star Wars. It's not just a book series. There are huge communities of people. There are people that their entire friend circle is built around Wheel of Time fandom because this thing has been going for so long. It's awesome, and it's incredible.
