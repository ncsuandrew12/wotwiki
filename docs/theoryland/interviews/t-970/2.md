#### John Hartness

Oh by the way, there are also no edits.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, good. Okay.

#### John Hartness

Hey y'all. Welcome back to Literate Liquors. I'm John Hartness. I'm your host, and I am still here at LibertyCon. I would say, thus the same t-shirt. But since I had t-shirts printed for the show, I'm probably always going to be wearing a "Read Recklessly" t-shirt from here on out. So get used to it. I do have two and I wash them a lot.

#### Brandon Sanderson

(laughs)

#### John Hartness

I also have more than one pair of black jeans. Just sayin'. I know I go to cons, but I'm not one of those scary gamer guys. Anyway, here with me . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're actually pretty scary. I don't know . . .

#### John Hartness

But I'm not much of a gamer guy . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah . . . There you go. I guess that was a truthful statement.

#### John Hartness

Yeah. So, here with me this evening is
*New York Times*
best-selling author, Parsec award winning Podcaster, all-around cool dude, writing instructor to the masses, Wheel of Time finisher-upper, Mistborn creator . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

Secret assassin of JFK. Oh wait, we aren't supposed to say that. Nevermind.

#### John Hartness

Shit. I told you no edits. Brandon Sanderson, folks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hi.

#### John Hartness

Out there somewhere there are people applauding.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, good. Okay. Hi. Yes, I'm Brandon. I write books and stuff.
