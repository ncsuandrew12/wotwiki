# [Interview #970: Literate Liquors Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=970#6)

#### John Hartness

That's awesome. I'm not going to keep you too much longer. And since you're not a drinker . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not a drinker. That's a . . . yeah.

#### John Hartness

But you did tell me you had an alcohol-related story . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

I kind of have one, and it's not about me.

#### John Hartness

We are still writers.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's actually about . . . so this is your piece of trivia. I am Mormon, and I was roommates in college with another famous Mormon—
[Ken Jennings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings)
, who won all the
*Jeopardy!*
money.

#### John Hartness

Okay, all right.

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is my roommate from college. And so the only liquor story, you like . . . hey, liquor stuff. He, on
*Jeopardy!*
, kept flubbing all the liquor questions. 'Cause he's Mormon!

#### John Hartness

Right.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And so my friend Ken had to go memorize big lists of mixed drinks. So he's the most literate person in all sorts of alcohol that I know that's Mormon because he had to have all these questions for
*Jeopardy!*
And so he keeps buzzing in and winning these things. It's pretty amusing.

#### John Hartness

Were there Elders calling him with questions, "So Ken . . . is there something you need to be telling us?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

(laughs) Yeah, I don't know.

#### John Hartness

Or is it more like, "Ken, you tithe appropriately and we'll just never mention this again."

#### Brandon Sanderson

(laughs) Yeah, I don't know. You should have him on some time. He's an author, too. But, there's your piece of trivia: Brandon Sanderson, Ken Jennings—roommates.

#### John Hartness

There we go. That's as close as I can get for a liquor commentary out of a guy who said, "What flavor of water shall I discuss on your podcast?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that's right. That's right.

#### John Hartness

As I'm sitting here drinking a Dasani because still I drank one of those jalapeno things, and it made my teeth sweat.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Those things look kind of cool.

#### John Hartness

They're very pretty.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I envy you guys—the drinkers—because your drinks look so awesome. It's like they look like the coolest Kool-Aid that's ever been made. I bet they don't taste like Kool-Aid.

#### John Hartness

Actually, I had some punch last night that tasted like Kool-Aid, except it was 85 degree Kool-Aid, and it was disgusting.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right, okay.

#### John Hartness

So no, you're really not missing that much, except for . . .

#### Brandon Sanderson

The booze.

#### John Hartness

Yeah, except for the booze. Brandon, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

#### Brandon Sanderson

My pleasure.
