#### Outis

What other magic systems in the Cosmere have that same kind of, "If you use it a lot it gets better?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is a little bit more like wedging open cracks in the soul by letting the Investiture come in, and it can open the cracks more.

#### Outis

Are there other magic systems like that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Outis

Will we see those any time soon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Maybe...RAFO.
