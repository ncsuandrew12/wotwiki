# [Interview #1048: WOR Signing Report - IronCaf, Entry #54](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1048#54)

#### Chris\_from\_Warrenton

Would it be possible to Soulforge NIghtblood and change the command that was given to him when he was Invested?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is possible. That would actually not be a very difficult Soulforge. The problem is, he's Invested. So reInvesting him, which is what Soulforgery is, is really hard. So you'd have to figure out how you could use Forgery on something that is already Invested. But forgery can get through some of those hoops a lot easier than some other magic systems can.

#### Chris\_from\_Warrenton

Do you have to be a willing subject to be Soulforged?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You do not. Working with the soul is really hard though. You have to be a supreme expert in what you're doing, because soul is Investiture
