#### Outis

In Shallan, in the beginning and middle of the book it's 10 heartbeats, and in the end of the book it's none...?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The 10 heartbeats is required to revive a dead shardblade

#### Outis

But he wasn't dead the whole time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wasn't. But perception--all magic systems in the Cosmere are based on perception-what you think you can do. For instance, Kaladin can't get healed because he sees himself as having a wounded forehead with the scars and that can't vanish because his perception is in the way.
