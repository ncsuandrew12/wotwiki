# [Interview #1048: WOR Signing Report - IronCaf, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1048#2)

#### IronCaf

In what ways is the process of becoming an allomantic savant like body building or other exercise?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Paraphrasing] That is not an inapt metaphor for it. It's like a wedge gets in the soul and cracks it, and investiture can fill it up.

#### IronCaf

And using allomancy breaks it further?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### IronCaf

Do other magic systems in the Cosmere function in a similar way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### IronCaf

Which ones? Will we see them soon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm going to have to RAFO that.
