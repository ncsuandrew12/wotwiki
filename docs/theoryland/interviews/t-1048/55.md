# [Interview #1048: WOR Signing Report - IronCaf, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1048#55)

#### Chris\_from\_Warrenton

[Paraphrased]In order to use magic from one world on another world, do they need a bit of [the first world's] Shard with you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It helps a lot. But there are other ways to do it. What's going on in the Cosmere is people have 3 sets of DNA. They have Physical DNA, Spiritual DNA, and Cognitive DNA. Their Spiritual DNA is what encodes the magic system into them, their Investiture. So if you can find a way to rewrite your Spiritual DNA, you can do all kinds of funky things. That's what Hemalurgy does. It rips off a piece of someone else's soul, staples it to yours. So if you went with a Hemalurgic spike to the right place, ripped off a piece of someone's soul and stapled it to yourself, you could create short circuits that will let you do all kinds of goofy stuff.
