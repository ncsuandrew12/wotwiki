#### Outis

Will Allomancy affect Shardblades?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It cannot affect Shardblades. Well, cannot is a strong term. Things with innate Investiture are much more difficult to affect by any of the magics at all. Which is why it's very hard for Szeth to bind people or lash people wearing Shardplate to the ceiling. In the same way Allomancy wouldn't be able to push on it without some help. Duralumin with a strong Push would probably do it.

#### Outis

I was just wondering if it was actually metal.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is metalish--it's metal enough for Allomancy to work on it.
