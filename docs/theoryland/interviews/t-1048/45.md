# [Interview #1048: WOR Signing Report - IronCaf, Entry #45](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1048#45)

#### Outis

Given that Investiture is Investiture, would there be potential Investiture of like, kandra to Parshendi using Hemalurgic spikes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hemalurgic spikes can be used on any planet.

#### Outis

Would it be potential for Parshendi to develop a form using the spikes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Wow, that would be a really weird hack of the magic system that would be theoretically possible. But that's a really weird one. I had never even considered that one. Parshendi adopting other Investiture could happen, the spikes is not one I've considered.
