#### Outis

What was the tweak you wanted to put in the end?

#### Brandon Sanderson

At the end of the day, I kind of wish that I had had Kaladin decide not to kill Szeth. But him killing Szeth is what the outline calls for and it's going to send the book in some interesting ways but I kinda wish I hadn't done that. Forcing him to live with what he'd done instead. Taking his blade and forcing him to live with what he'd done, I'd kind of wish that's what I'd done.
