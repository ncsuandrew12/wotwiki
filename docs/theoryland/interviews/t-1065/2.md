Shadows for Silence

This year, I have a few works that are eligible. The first I'd draw your attention to is "
[Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell](http://brandonsanderson.com/shadows-for-silence-in-the-forests-of-hell/)
," my story in the anthology
[*Dangerous Women*](http://brandonsanderson.com/shadows-for-silence-in-the-forests-of-hell/)
, edited by George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois. I think this is my strongest short fiction piece of the year, and it is eligible in the novella category.

As I did last year with
*The Emperor's Soul*
, I will send an electronic copy of "Shadows for Silence" to anyone who is eligible to vote or nominate for either the Hugos or the Nebula Awards. So if you had a membership for last year's Worldcon, or if you're planning to attend this year, please drop me an email at ebooks@brandonsanderson.com requesting an ebook of "Shadows for Silence" and saying which Worldcon you're a member of (or saying you're an active SFWA member), and we'll respond with a copy of the story.
