# [Interview #1065: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Regarding Awards, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1065#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm a little late to the party this year, but I wanted to post a few words about awards season. If you want to nominate for the Hugo Awards you either need to have had a membership to last year's Worldcon in San Antonio, or you need to be registered for this year's
[Worldcon in London](http://loncon3.org/)
by this Friday, the 31st of January. (Note that you don't have to nominate by then, you simply have to have your membership by then to be able to nominate.) A membership to next year's
[Worldcon in Spokane](http://sasquan.org/)
will also let you nominate this year.

I've spoken before about the benefits of a supporting membership to Worldcon. This is the membership you buy if you're not actually planning to attend, but still want to vote. It costs Â£25/$40 (until the end of February, when the rates go up), and along with that you get the voter packet, which historically has contained electronic copies of every nominated fiction work (but whether all works are included each year is up to the authors and publishers). So it's a fantastic deal, and you also get to be part of a grand tradition in science fiction and fantasy. (Note: Only supporting or attending members of this year's Worldcon in London will be able to receive the voter packet and vote on the final ballot.)
