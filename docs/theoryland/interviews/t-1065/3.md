# [Interview #1065: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Regarding Awards, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1065#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Other Eligible Works

Writing Excuses Season Eight is also eligible in the Best Related Work category. We won last year, which was thrilling. Thank you all for your nominations and votes! (I believe we won by three votes.)

"Lift," which you can read for free
[here](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/12/words-of-radiance-excerpt-lift)
, is eligible in the novelette category. Though it is part of
*Words of Radiance*
, it also stands on its own, and is worth consideration.

Both
[*Steelheart*](http://brandonsanderson.com/books/steelheart/steelheart/)
and
[*The Rithmatist*](http://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-rithmatist/the-rithmatist/)
are eligible in the Hugo novel category and are, I believe, eligible for the
[Andre Norton Award](http://www.sfwa.org/tag/andre-norton-award/)
.

I also have other shorts eligible in various categories, but I think the ones listed above are the stronger works.
