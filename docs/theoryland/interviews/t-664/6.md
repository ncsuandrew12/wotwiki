# [Interview #664: East of the Sun Con - Hans Persson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=664#6)

#### Hans Persson

After this there was an interview with the editor Harriet McDougal (married to Robert Jordan). I think it was mostly related to the publishing business but it was rather boring so I left them fairly soon. After a walk through the different rooms I finally went home to my bed at the other end of the city.
