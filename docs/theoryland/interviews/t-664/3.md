# [Interview #664: East of the Sun Con - Hans Persson, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=664#3)

#### Hans Persson

In connection with "Östan om sol" I got an opportunity to attend a bookmeeting á la SFSF. Because I was able to get my job to send me on a business trip to Stockholm for four days right before "Östan om sol" was about to begin, I happened to be in place for when SFSF would discuss Michael Swanwick's
*The Iron Dragon's Daughter*
. That I hadn't read the book bothered me little, it happens as we know fairly often at LSFF's bookmeetings that not everyone has read the current book. Unsuspectingly I followed Anders Holmström down into a shady basement where a distinct aura of cigarette smoke already had appeared. When it was decided no more would show up, it turned out I was the only one who hadn't read the book. Slightly amazed by this I still threw myself happily into the debate—to have not read the book shouldn't as we know be a bar to having an opinion. After about an hour we concluded that the discussion was coming to an end and everyone suddenly started to rise and move to the door. Not really the same as in Linköping where the book could be discussed in about 15 minutes in a five hour meeting.
