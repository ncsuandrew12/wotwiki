# [Interview #664: East of the Sun Con - Hans Persson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=664#1)

#### Thomas Wreiner

There we go, I left out the two last paragraphs which had nothing to do with Robert Jordan other than the last comment about he thought a small convention like this should probably have asked someone not as famous as Jordan to come, since he became surrounded by fans all the time. Not that I know how that would be any different at a large convention though. :)

I've made a few notations with "\*" that are at the bottom of the text, either about translation or just a comment of what he wrote. Not a whole lot of interesting stuff in the post itself, I thought the guy's take on the whole thing was amusing though. :)

Lysator, where he posted this in the first place, is a computer society in Link√∂ping University (where I am at actually). Pretty geeky/weird community, and I think it shows a bit. :) I am not a member of Lysator. :)
