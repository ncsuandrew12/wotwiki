# [Interview #636: Open The Fridge Interview, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=636#1)

#### Lyndsey Luther

World-famous fantasy author Brandon Sanderson graciously agreed to a short interview with us here at Open the Fridge after his New York City book signing on Wednesday. Mr. Sanderson is currently touring to promote the release of his newest novel,
*The Alloy of Law*
, which reached #7 on the
*New York Times*
Best Seller List this week. (Make sure you check out our review!) We had to keep the interview short, as his time on this tour was rather limited, but he managed to find time to speak briefly about how he researches his novels, his unique magic systems, and some of the underlying theory of the over-arching magic system of his connected universe, the Cosmere.

He also donated 8 copies of
*The Alloy of Law*
“broadsheet” to give away to our readers! If you want one (and you should), then come back here tomorrow at 10:30 AM EST—we'll post up the information on how to win one of these collectible in-world newspapers!
