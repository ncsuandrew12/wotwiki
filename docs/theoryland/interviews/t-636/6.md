# [Interview #636: Open The Fridge Interview, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=636#6)

#### Open The Fridge

Thank you, Mr. Sanderson, for these extremely in-depth answers! I suspect that the diligent Cosmere fans over at the 17th Shard will be going over that last one with a fine-toothed comb.
*The Alloy of Law*
is on sale now at bookstores around the country, and
*A Memory of Light*
, the long-awaited final book of the Wheel of Time series (which Mr. Sanderson is helping to finish after the unfortunate passing of author Robert Jordan), is nearly complete and expected to hit stores sometime next year. If you’re a Wheel of Time fan, don’t forget to follow Mr. Sanderson’s progress on his twitter account during the course of this tour. The Great Hunt is upon us once again! You can help to find and solve clues Mr. Sanderson has hidden across the world and unlock a special Wheel of Time “prize.”

Again, if you are interested in winning one of the eight in-world collectible newspapers (called “broadsheets”), check back tomorrow for all the details. On December 3rd, we’ll randomly choose eight winners from among those who participated!
