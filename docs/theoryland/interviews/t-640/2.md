# [Interview #640: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zombie Sammael, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=640#2)

#### Zombie Sammael

In
*The Gathering Storm*
Graendal thinks that Demandred had a shot at being the Dragon. What we were wondering was whether this refers to the soul itself or to the title Dragon, and if the title is tied to the soul.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon then said (quite excitingly IMO) that it actually went further than that, and if perhaps Rand had died whether someone else would have taken over that role.

#### ZOMBIE SAMMAEL

If that had happened, would that person be called Dragon?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I'll give you this: there was no chance of Demandred ever being Dragon.

#### ZOMBIE SAMMAEL

Ah, that's a bit similar to the answer you gave before. But if not Demandred, somebody else?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Maybe.
