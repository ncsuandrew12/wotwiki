# [Interview #640: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Zombie Sammael, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=640#3)

#### Zombie Sammael

Personally, I think that "maybe" is damned interesting, because it implies there may be something he didn't want to give away. I have a wild theory about that which I might come on to. It certainly seems to imply, however, that the title Dragon is not completely exclusive to Rand, but does put it outside the realms of possibility for Demandred. Kind of a frustrating answer in terms of settling the debate, but interesting nonetheless.

As to my wild (but not quite looney) theory, I'm wondering if it isn't possible that someone else will actually end up fulfilling Rand's role at the end of the series. It would be a huge bait and switch and possible unsatisfying for us, but there does seem to be a possibility, both in terms of the Logain prophecy of glory, and in terms of the original conception of the series, in that the Chosen One couldn't do it for whatever reason and someone else had to step in. To my mind, from both Brandon's playful manner and his reply, it certainly seems as if something from AMOL ties into this. Then again, I might be reading too much into a smile and a nod.
