# [Interview #976: Talking With Tom: A Conversation Between Tom Doherty and Harriet McDougal, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=976#18)

#### Tom Doherty

*A Memory of Light*
was the biggest first day we've ever had.

#### Harriet McDougal

Which is something.

#### Tom Doherty

Yep. Harriet's agent, Nat Sobel, just sent us an e‑mail saying it's number one in England, too, right now. They said it outsold the one behind it four‑to‑one.

#### Harriet McDougal

It's so nice that missing Christmas didn't hurt. I really worried about that, but we just needed the time to comb its hair.

#### Tom Doherty

It had to be done right. It's just too important not to do it right. Rushing wouldn't work for this.
