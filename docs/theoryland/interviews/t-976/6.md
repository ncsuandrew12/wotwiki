# [Interview #976: Talking With Tom: A Conversation Between Tom Doherty and Harriet McDougal, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=976#6)

#### Tom Doherty

Just to comment apropos of what I was saying earlier about this talented lady: we just got the Indie bestseller list in. Robert Jordan's
*A Memory of Light*
is number one, okay? But another book Harriet acquired,
*Ender's Game*
, is number seven on the mass market list. This novel was published in '85. Now, how many books from '85 are in the top ten bestsellers?

#### Harriet McDougal

This is a year for
*Ender's Game*
if ever I saw one.

#### Tom Doherty

Well, we're ahead of publicity. It's just starting. It's on the bestseller list now. It was last year too. Seventeen times, if you count the extended bestseller list of the
*Times*
.

#### Harriet McDougal

Wow, that's amazing.

#### Tom Doherty

Yeah. And Harriet's mentioned in the novel's acknowledgments. Scott [Orson Scott Card] talks about what a great editor she is, too. So there are other people with exactly the same opinion.
