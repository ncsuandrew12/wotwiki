# [Interview #976: Talking With Tom: A Conversation Between Tom Doherty and Harriet McDougal, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=976#20)

#### Harriet McDougal

I get a lot of questions about Dannil, the character who was cut out of
*The Eye of the World*
. Dannil sort of figures in that cover painting. [Referring to a painting of an
*Eye of the World*
poster in Tom Doherty's office.] There's an extra character in there. He has a ghostly life.

#### Tom Doherty

Darrell Sweet was doing many of the biggest fantasies in the 1990's.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, using his work was a big expense for a little company. It was one of the ways in which you did such a superb job of publishing. Also, what's so nice about the gorgeous Michael Whelan cover for the last book is that it's obviously a Michael Whelan, but he very tactfully made it so that when you rack them all out, they look like family. That was a lovely thing he did.

#### Irene Gallo

It is. He did a good job. The palette and compostion really works with the other covers. I didn't envy him the job and he turned it into a nice tribute as well as a conclusion.

#### Harriet McDougal

And Sam Weber is so nice. I keep trying to call him Sam Weller because of Dickens. He said Whelan called him once and asked: "What's a
*ter'angreal*
?"

Looking at
*[The Way of Kings](http://www.tor.com/tags/the%20way%20of%20kings)*
, I had an extraordinary coincidence. A friend of mine's former wife is a curator at the Phillips Collection in Washington. She's a descendent of John Martin, an English painter also known as
[Mad Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Martin_%28painter%29)
. He was the highest paid artist in Great Britain in the 1840's, and then he sank into total obscurity until a couple of war refugees rediscovered and resurrected his works after World War II.
[One of his paintings](http://inkbloodmagic.blogspot.com/2011/06/john-martin.html)
is the cover of
*The Way of Kings*
, except that there's a big pantheon where the guy is in the distance.

#### Irene Gallo

I'm going to look that up.

#### Harriet McDougal

His skies are very much like Michael Whelan's. He was doing all that stuff way back then. I don't know if Whelan's ever looked at him, but it looks as if he has. Those fabulous skies of Whelan's.
