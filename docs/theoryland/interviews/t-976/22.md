#### Stefan Raets

Tom Doherty has been a central figure in genre publishing for decades. He is the founder, President and Publisher of Tom Doherty Associates, which publishes books under the Tor, Forge, Orb, Tor Teen and Starscape imprints. Tor Books, which he founded more than three decades ago, has won the Locus Award for Best Publisher every single year since 1988.

Harriet McDougal is the widow of James Oliver Rigney Jr., better known to the world as Wheel of Time author Robert Jordan. She is also an accomplished editor who worked with Tom Doherty at Tempo and Ace and in the founding of Tor Books.

And that concludes this fascinating conversation between two towering figures in fantasy. Stay tuned for future installments of "Talking with Tom"!
