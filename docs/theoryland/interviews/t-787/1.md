# [Interview #787, Entry #1]: TGS Signing Report - mrc1ark](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=787#1)

I asked Brandon about the balefire and Min's bruises tonight at the DC book signing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that he, Harriet, and Maria discussed them and decided they should stay. Semirhage got balefired, not Rand, and Rand made the bruises therefore bruises stay. Thats according to the source. So even if you disagree with those rules that seems to be the way it will be interpreted for the last two books. Sanderson did admit that things with balefire were tricky.
