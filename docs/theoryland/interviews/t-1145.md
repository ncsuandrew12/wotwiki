## [Entry #1](./t-1145/1)

#### CthulhuSpren

Could Wax, Vin, or TLR burn nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(paraphrased) Firstly, you're assuming Nightblood is not allomantically inert (he didnt say if it was or not), but if it was, it would be like trying to burn someone else's metalmind.

## [Entry #2](./t-1145/2)

#### CthulhuSpren

Could you tell me anything about the other (Dysian) Aimians?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(paraphrased) You'll be surprised when you see them, they're barely humanoid.
