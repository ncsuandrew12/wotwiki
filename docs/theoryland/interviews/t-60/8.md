# [Interview #60: East of the Sun Con - Karl-Johan Nor√©n, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=60#8)

#### Robert Jordan

Some of the "Read-and-find-out-answers" are partly due to that there are things that
*might*
happen, not decided yet, in future books. He also saw it as a way to diminish the reader's reading experience due to narrowing his view of the future works. And he was vastly amused by our looney theories, especially the Bela Darkfriend one. Unfortunately, I missed telling him of the Demandred being Olver theory.
