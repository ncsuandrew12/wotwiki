#### Robert Jordan

Authors he recommended were Guy Gavriel Kay, CS Friedman and Ray Feist in the fantasy genre. Non-fantasy he recommended his major inspirator: Mark Twain. He wouldn't give any non-recommended authors.

He said he reads about 300-400 books per year, which is a drop-off from what he normally read due to the high workload from the WoT books.
