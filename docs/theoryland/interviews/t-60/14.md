# [Interview #60: East of the Sun Con - Karl-Johan Nor√©n, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=60#14)

#### Robert Jordan

When told about the Bela in
*Lord of Chaos*
plot contest he said that he knew what Bela had been doing in
*Lord of Chaos*
. WARNING! Non-family newsfroup material! Quote made without consent from the Great Lord of the Dark! "I wouldn't quite call it lesbian bestiality. Rather a very close mutual friendship with a certain female in Salidar." [I wonder who? :-)]

#### Footnote

[The 'froup' thing is apparently an inside joke at rasfwrj.]
