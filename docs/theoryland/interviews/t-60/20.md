# [Interview #60: East of the Sun Con - Karl-Johan Nor√©n, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=60#20)

#### Robert Jordan

On the choosing a deposing of the Keeper he said that the Amyrlin chooses the Keeper herself, as shown in
*Lord of Chaos*
, but that the deposition of the Keeper requires an unanimous decision from the Hall. The glossary entry on the Keeper in
*The Shadow Rising*
he said was incorrect in this regard.
