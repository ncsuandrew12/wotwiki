On if Aes Sedai
*damane*
can use the One Power in battle he said that [OBS! secondary source, I didn't hear him say this myself] it is theoretically possible, basically by forcing the Aes Sedai to think that she does not use the One Power as
*damane*
. It is though very hard to achieve. In the book next after
*A Crown of Swords*
, this might become a factor.
