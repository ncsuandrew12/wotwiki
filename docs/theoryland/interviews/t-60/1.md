Robert Jordan tidbits

Summary of various talks and chats with Robert Jordan at the East of the Sun fantasy convention, Stockholm, Sweden the 16-18 of June 1995.

Summary written by Karl-Johan Norén

All errors are made by me, and no one else, especially not Robert Jordan.

The answers are pretty mixed up from two group chats I had with him, two seminars (one on the use on myth in fantasy and the other on why to use fantasy as a medium) and a moderated public interview with pre-written questions. I can't guarantee any quotes, since I didn't have a recorder but just made notes.
