#### Robert Jordan

There is nothing he would have done basically different with hindsight in the writing of TWoT. Originally
*The Eye of the World*
was half as large as it was printed, but the later books have been written so "tight" from the start that it has been impossible to shorten them.

His writing technique with the WoT books he described as "simply stretch out and run".
