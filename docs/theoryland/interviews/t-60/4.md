#### Robert Jordan

On linking he stated that six men is the maximum number of men present in a link, and 66 is the limit for women. He also said that the "one more women than men rule" in the
*Lord of Chaos*
glossary was invalid. Complete rules for linking would be found in the WoT Guide.

#### Footnote

Six men is the minimum number necessary for a circle of 72, which is the maximum size circle (and that would leave 66 spots for women), but there can be as many as 35 men in a full circle.
