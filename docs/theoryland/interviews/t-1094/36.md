#### Question

I'm not sure if it was duralumin or something but the Feruchemical ability to store Connection, is that how Hoid worldhops? It stores Connection to another world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a good question, it doesn't have anything to do with worldhopping
*but*
what it does do is once you have worldhopped you can change your Connection to which planet you are on, which helps you with magic systems.
