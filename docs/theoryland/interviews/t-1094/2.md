# [Interview #1094: Salt Lake City Comic-Con 2014, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1094#2)

#### Question

My one question is how do you make it so writing isn't work, because if I'm writing for work I don't write as well. How do you get in the mind set?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know for me, taking a walk before hand, listening to some awesome music, and just imagining why this scene is going to be awesome and the emotional impact of it really helps. But at the same time writing is always going to be a little bit work and there is no getting around that. I mean, it's hard sometimes and so-- I don't know. For me I've enjoyed it more as it has become work and I can devote more time to it and things like that. But... Try that.

#### Question

Just get in the mood...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Listen to music and put myself in that scene, what it feels like, what it sounds like, smells like. Just put myself here and think about what is going to make it incredible and I'll get really excited about writing it. Excitement translates I think at least for me onto the page.
