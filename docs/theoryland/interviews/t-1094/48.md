#### Question

What's lerasium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is the bead of metal that Elend finds at the end of Book 2, that Vin finds and gives to Elend.

#### Question

Oh so there were only two and the Lord Ruler kind of left it there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There actually were a bunch of them, and the first Mistborn came from people who ate that. The Lord Ruler took one for himself and he left others there to use if he needed them.
