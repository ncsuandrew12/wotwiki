#### Question

Is the level of burning [in Allomancy] a continuous distribution, can I burn 0.1 level of steel all the way up to flaring? Or is it just I burn or I flare?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The more skilled you are, the more you have the ability to moderate that. For most people it is burn or flare. But you can kind of burn up to a flare, does that make sense? Going below is really hard.

#### Question

Can you push a flare?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
