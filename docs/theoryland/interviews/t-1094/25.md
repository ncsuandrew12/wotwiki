# [Interview #1094: Salt Lake City Comic-Con 2014, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1094#25)

#### Question

Who is your favorite character you've written, if you had to pick one?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a hard question, I can't pick a favorite character. Dalinar is what I normally say, just because I've been working on him the longest. Honestly, I don't know. It's whoever I'm working on at the time.

#### Question

Dalinar is a good character, I like Kaladin a lot too.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kaladin has really worked out well. It's interesting because Kaladin-- the first time I wrote
*The Way of Kings*
, in 2002, did not work and I had to rip him out and try a completely different personality and things for him. So it's cool to see it finally working.
