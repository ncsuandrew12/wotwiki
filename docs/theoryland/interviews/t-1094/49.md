# [Interview #1094: Salt Lake City Comic-Con 2014, Entry #49](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1094#49)

#### Question

Is there anything in the works right now roleplaying-wise for any of your other works?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not yet, the response to the Mistborn rpg has been good so I do think we'll do something eventually but right now we just want to support that. It takes a lot of effort to keep one of these supported, because they make it but we have to read everything and talk about continuity and stuff. Maybe eventually.
