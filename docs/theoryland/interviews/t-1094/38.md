#### Question

So Stormlight and Breath are both just different manifestations of Investiture.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's correct.

#### Question

So Nightblood and Shardblades are both kind of powered by Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, in fact you can call Nightblood kind of a miss-made, evil Shardblade-- more miss-made than evil but yes.

#### Question

But a Shardblade wouldn't shear through Nightblood.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes a Shardblade would not shear through Nightblood. In fact I wrote
*The Way of Kings*
first and then I wrote
*Warbreaker*
and
*The Way of Kings*
came out after
*Warbreaker*
but in my mind
*Warbreaker*
is a prequel to
*The Way of Kings*
, where I was telling Vasher's backstory.

#### Question

Oh really, so the
*Warbreaker*
we know takes place after
*The Way of Kings*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it takes place before, it's a prequel meaning I wrote
*The Way of Kings*
and then I went back in time and told Vasher's backstory but
*Warbreaker*
ended up coming out first because
*The Way of Kings*
wasn't ready yet.
