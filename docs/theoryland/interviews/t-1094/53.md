#### Question

How many different kinds of magic does Hoid know how to use? I know you can't tell me exactly but is it hundreds or like dozens?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on your definition of types of magic, in some ways you could say they are all one. He knows multiple varieties, but not hundreds.
