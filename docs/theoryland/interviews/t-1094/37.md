# [Interview #1094: Salt Lake City Comic-Con 2014, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1094#37)

#### Question

So do Inquisitors, when they use Allomancy, have to actually ingest the metals?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They actually do. So what is happening is Hemalurgy rips off a piece of one person's soul and spikes it somebody else and so it is basically taking off the piece of someone's soul that makes them an Allomancer and adding it to someone else instead and so then they act as an Allomancer just as it would happen.
