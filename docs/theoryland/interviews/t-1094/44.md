#### Question

In The Wheel of Time at the end when they start to use Gateways to spy on the other battlefields, was that your idea or Robert Jordanâ€™s idea?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had for years wanted them to use Gateways for things like that, because I'm kind of a magic system guy, right and it's like I'm writing these books now, they are going to use Gateways smart.
