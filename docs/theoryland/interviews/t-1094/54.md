#### Question

I assume I'm going to learn a lot more about this in Stormlight 3 but Nightblood, is he more dangerous or less dangerous now that he-- obviously he needs Investiture that is why [audio obscured] any investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd say more dangerous, a little bit easier to get the Stormlight.

#### Question

I assumed I'd learn a lot more about him...

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will, and he's pretty dangerous, but he is also less dangerous because other people have Shardblades, if that makes sense.
