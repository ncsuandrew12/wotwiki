#### Question

Is there any reference material for doing cosplay?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on the costume that you want to make. We have lots for
*The Stormlight Archive*
, less for other books. So if you want reference material for Stormlight costumes you can write us and we'll send you the concept art we are using.
