#### Question

The magic in
*The Emperor's Soul*
, is that the only magic you've written that there is a Spiritual part to it in your magic trio?

#### Brandon

Umm... All of them have some little dabbling in it, it is the most related to the Spiritual Realm-- Of the ones I have shown, certainly it is the most related.
