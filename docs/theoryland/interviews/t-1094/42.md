#### Question

So I'm reading
*The Alloy of Law*
right now, do you have a date for the sequel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah November next year.

#### Question

Is that one going to be a trilogy as well? Or just two books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's probably four.

#### Question

Oh four, okay, wow.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But it depends, that's what I've plotted right now. But it depends on how long it takes me to write The Stormlight Archive, because I want to do them in between Stormlight Archive books.
