# [Interview #1094: Salt Lake City Comic-Con 2014, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1094#15)

#### Question

Did you do the same thing with Kaladin's depression?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I did but that one is a little closer to home, [several people in Brandon's life have depression].

#### Question

I have depression as well, it's pretty inspiring to me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I had never seen a hero who had depression and I was like "I need to do a real, legitimate that it's not about their depression, they just have it" Does that make sense? Like whenever I read a book it is all about them having depression. And I'm like "No, your life is not about you having depression, your life-- that is part of your life but--" So it was very important to me that I get that one right.

#### Question

I just, yeah I just find your book so inspiring so I just really appreciate you doing all this for us.

#### Footnote

This questioner is different from the preceding one, they followed immediately after so overheard the previous answer.
