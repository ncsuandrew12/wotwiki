#### Question

Who is Wit?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is a character who has been in all of the books so far and is somehow getting between all of the different planets these are taking place on and is somehow surviving the fact that these books are hundreds of years apart.

#### Question

I have a good idea that he's a Mistborn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well he did steal a bead of lerasium.

#### Question

And he has extra Breath because he said it was easier with perfect pitch.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He did indeed say that didn't he... I will eventually write a book series that is about him, but it is a ways off.
