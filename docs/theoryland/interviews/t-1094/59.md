And I was trying to figure out how jazz could possibly develop on Scadrial in
*The Alloy of Law*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

How what?

#### theravenchilde

How Jazz could develop on Scadrial.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Jazz? Okay.

#### theravenchilde

[audio obscured] Would it be appropriate to compare the Steel Ministry to the Catholic Church? Not so much in doctrine but...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sure, that would be appropriate. I mean when I'm writing Alloy of Law era they are only hitting big band stuff.

#### theravenchilde

That's what I figured.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Their music would lag behind ours.

#### theravenchilde

'Cause big band stuff started around the 1920's

#### Brandon Sanderson

There not even quite there yet. In the second or the third... anyway one of the Alloy books Wax hears someone and they've added to a band brass and he's like "that's not right" he's expecting violin concertos or a pianoforte and he's hearing brass.
