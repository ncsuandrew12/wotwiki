#### Question

My brother and I disagreed, at the very end of
*Words of Radiance*
, the sword that-- Is it the same as in
*Warbreaker*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes it is, in fact Vasher is in the book.

#### Question

Is that Vasher?!? [Presumably referring to Nale]

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, look for somebody making color metaphors and when they are waking up they feel like they can sense other people's presence and things like that. There is one character who is Vasher. He doesn't go by that name anymore.
