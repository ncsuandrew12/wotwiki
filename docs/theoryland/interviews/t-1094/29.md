#### Question

So I've been told there is one character who is in each of the series.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes there is.

#### Question

Is that Wit by chance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is.

#### Question

Does he show up in some of the others?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, in this [
*Mistborn: The Final Empire*
] he shows up briefly, Kelsier meets with a blind beggar at one point who is introduced by the name Hoid and that is the name Wit uses through most of the books. If you read
*Warbreaker*
he's in that one, there is a storyteller who uses dust and sand. He's in most of them.
*The Way of Kings*
is where you see him the most, he's not in the other ones nearly as much, but he's mentioned by name in most of them.
