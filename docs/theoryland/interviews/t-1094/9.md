#### Question

I had a question about
*White Sand*
, we both read the draft of it, it's going to graphic novel. What's your involvement with that? Are you kind of passing over the draft?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We passed the book to the writer, the writer is sending us scripts, and we are commenting on them and things like that. There are a few big changes I've made to the story, that it needed, and things like that. But we are letting the script writer write the scripts and then we are reading them over.
