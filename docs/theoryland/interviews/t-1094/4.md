#### Question

I actually have a weird question. From the Mistborn series it says there are 16 Allomantic metals but then you go into
*The Alloy of Law*
and the 16 are listed there, minus the atium and another one, so are there really 18 metals?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, you see those two were not really metals. Those were pieces, fragments, of a god.

#### Question

I thought that might be it but the symbols are the same above them from-- the atium symbol is the same as--

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, it's a different symbol, it might be reversed though.
