#### Question

I heard once that Robert Jordan had like 10GB of just pure text...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, now most of that was the sort of stuff that ends up in the glossaries... Most of it you wouldn't want to read, 'cause most of it is very boring stuff. They're putting a lot of that into an encyclopedia that will be coming out next fall, they just released the date on that. Not this November but next November.
