# [Interview #1094: Salt Lake City Comic-Con 2014, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1094#13)

#### Question

I love that book [The Rithmatist], the world, I'm looking forward to thoseâ€¦

#### Brandon Sanderson

The sequel is going to be very fun, it's called
*The Aztlanian*
, it's taking place in South America.

#### Question

Where in South America?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I've rebuilt South America so it's kind of weird. The Aztek empire, which is the main name the Northerners have for it, they call it something else. The problem is I shrunk the planet, so I had to smash South America and Central America a little bit into each other so the islands that they are is it South America? Central America? What is it?

#### Question

So is it Spanish-speaking? Or...

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, the Spaniards got fought off, they actually speak Nahautl.

#### Question

No Portuguese or Spanish? It's all...

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a couple Portuguese/Spanish islands but-- They grabbed a few of them but the main empire speaks Nahuatl.
