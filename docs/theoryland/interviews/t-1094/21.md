#### Question

What differentiates a minor Shardworld like First of the Sun?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The amount of Investiture, and whether there is actually a Shard in presence.

#### Question

I'm assuming there is not one there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is not one there.

#### Question

So it's like a Splintered one from something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No what you'll find is that the worlds were all created with a level of-- a little bit of sort of ambient magic. What you'll find in worlds like that is things like,
*Shadows for Silence*
and things like this, the magic, it's not necessarily "people with magic" it's you can interact with nature...

#### Question

So there is inherent investiture...

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is inherent investiture in every world created but you are going to see-- You aren't going to find Mistborn on a world like that but what you might find is a way there are magic aspects to the setting. Spren could exist on a world like that but they would be like the minor spren, you wouldn't find Syl, but you would find something like lifespren.
