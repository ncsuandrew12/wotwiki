## Entry #1

#### PrncRny

I'm fairly certain this is spoiler free. If someone thinks otherwise, feel free to move the thread, but I'm pretty darn confident in it.

Content is about WoT, Mistborn, AND Stormlight, a few questions from each.

I'll just post the WoT related ones here. If people want Stormlight or Mistborn questions, let me know and I'll add those in.

## Entry #2

#### PrncRny

I was thinking about Moiraine's questions to the Aelfinn. We already know what one of them was, is there any hint as to the other two?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If they aren't revealed in the last book, they will probably be in the encyclopedia. We want to save a few things for that, just so you know.

## Entry #3

#### PrncRny

I was thinking about the Bloodknives' rings. What are the stones that they have? Are they Shayol Ghul rocks or something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

\*long pause\* Finding Shayol Ghul rocks in Seanchan hands would be a very difficult thing.

#### PrncRny

So that's a no.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't say no. I just said it would be a very difficult thing.

## Entry #4

#### PrncRny

Next question was Stormlight. Then Mistborn.

## Entry #5

#### PrncRny

Do we ever find out how strong in the power Tuon would be if she ever snapped and started channeling? Did RJ leave any notes about that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes he did. The problem is that that's not the sort of thing I can work into the books very easily. The issue is that her strength would be tied to, well, people's strength go up they practice and things. Yes he has the notes, but there's no way the characters can know for sure. That would be something for the outriggers, which maybe we can get into the encyclopedia. He left a big list for everyone and a number for their power level, their strength in the One Power, just for comparison's sake, which was cool because it would also say 'Here's the threshold for creating a gateway and here's the threshold for this' and its a really cool list and I hope they put it into the encyclopaedia but I don't know if they will.

#### PrncRny

Ok, so she's not going to snap in the next one and start channeling?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well. Even if she did, how powerful she would get would not be immediately evident. Does that make sense?

## Entry #6

#### PrncRny

After that I asked for book referrals. So that's all the WoT relevant stuff. :) If you want to know what else I asked, like I said, make a note and I'll put it in another post in this thread.
