#### Brandon Sanderson

Here's our weekly (kind of) update of an HTML
*Warbreaker*
chapter and a Mistborn 2 Annotation! Those of you who are reading the annotations, I hope to eventually be able to get back to doing two of these a week, but I want to post responses to
*New Spring*
and
*Knife of Dreams*
first.

[*Well of Ascension*
Annotation: Chapter Twenty-Nine](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/220/Mistborn-2-Chapter-Twenty-Nine)
