## [Entry #1](./t-706/1)

#### Orome

This post is for anything info that was gleaned at the recent signing at Forbidden Planet in London.

To start with, The question i asked him was, 'Is Shalash the lady smashing up the art in
*The Way of Kings*
?'

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was apprehensive to say it out loud, but he wrote in my copy of
*Alloy of Law*
'Shalash appears in
*The Way of Kings*
'! I shall get a scan of that once i am able, and ill put it up in here. He also said to me 'you'd be surprised at how many of the Heralds appear in the book', so i guess another re-read is in order!

#### Footnote

Brandon has also
[hinted](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=4001)
that Jezrien was in the book. (See

.)

## [Entry #2](./t-706/2)

#### Orome

I also asked what project he would like to tackle next.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm assuming he meant after Stormlight Two. He said he really would like to get
*Elantris*
2 out in time for the 10th anniversary addition of
*Elantris*
, which will have extra art and other bits in it. after that one, he says he would love to do another stand alone, and said
*The Silence Divine*
would be his choice.

## [Entry #3](./t-706/3)

#### Fejicus

Hey, so me and 3 of my friends flew over from Ireland to go to this signing, so as a result Brandon was very happy to give us extra time to ask questions, and even stayed around for an extra 25-30 mins talking to us after his 4 hours of study, he's such a nice guy!
Anyway, we asked him a tonne of questions, and i'll get my mates to register here to add their questions to this thread, or i'll make another post when they send me their info!

## [Entry #4](./t-706/4)

#### Fejicus

(something along the lines of how exactly is what you see when you burn gold determined)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that each time you burn gold, you see a different image, so it changes depending on your current situation.

## [Entry #5](./t-706/5)

#### Fejicus

What would happen if you burned Duralumin and Bendalloy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He gave us a big RAFO, and i think hinted at that it was going to play a part in future books, so its going to be important.

## [Entry #6](./t-706/6)

#### Fejicus

At the end of
*Alloy of Law*
, Marsh tells Marasi, that Wax is doing "his brothers work". Does this mean Kelsier is still meddling, or is this a continuation of his initial legacy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kelsier has never been good at doing what he's told. He's still interfering.

## [Entry #7](./t-706/7)

#### Fejicus

The Stormlight Archive is going to be in two 5-book arcs; will there be a big gap between these (story time wise)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said there would be a small gap, nothing as big as Mistborn and
*Alloy of Law*
, but it would be there.

## [Entry #8](./t-706/8)

#### Fejicus

Is the size of speed bubbles affected by the strength of the allomancer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #9](./t-706/9)

#### Fejicus

Is Officer Brettin Tensoon at the end of the book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. (He let on during the signing that TenSoon made an appearance, and my friend Joe guessed it was Brettin, and Brandon confirmed it then later to us)

## [Entry #10](./t-706/10)

#### Fejicus

I made a comment about the role mythology plays in WoT, and if Brandon was planning on using any real world mythological parallels for the Stormlight Archive.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he said that while they play a huge role in WoT, that if he were to include mythological parallels in Stormlight, that they would be parallels of Roshar's own mythology. (So perhaps were going to see Kaladin/Dalinar paralleling the Heralds?)

## [Entry #11](./t-706/11)

#### Fejicus

Concerning the Radiants' shardplates, and the glyphs on them that Dalinar had never seen before, is there any relation to these and the AonDor? Could they perhaps act as an added focus?

#### Brandon Sanderson

From what I recall, he didn't really give a definitive answer on this one, but he seemed as if we were in the right direction.

## [Entry #12](./t-706/12)

#### Fejicus

Oh, and another little tidbit,

#### Brandon Sanderson

The person who gave Wax his earring was the kandra, MeLaan.

Also, that Kandra are working as "Sazed's Angels". And their role is primarily to go along fixing things by Sazed's Will. Brettin was killed towards the end of the book, but not in the storyline related plot. Sazed saw this, and told Tensoon to go get his bones, which is why he wasnt able to imitate him properly.

## [Entry #13](./t-706/13)

#### Fejicus

The person who wrote the Ars Arcanum in
*Alloy of Law*
, is that the same person who wrote the Letter in
*Way of Kings*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Its not confirmed, but it's either Hoid, or someone in the 17th Shard. (However, thinking back, I'm not sure if he fully heard/understood the question, and perhaps he was expecting it to be something else. But it seems to me that if he namedropped Hoid, that he may have misunderstood the question, as it seems very likely that Hoid wrote the Letter, I dont think he'd let something slip like that. So i would count this information as rather tenuous.)
