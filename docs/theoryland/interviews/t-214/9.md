# [Interview #214: Robert Jordan's Blog: AND ONE MORE TIME, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=214#9)

#### Robert Jordan

For jofraz, I have gay and lesbian characters in my books, but the only time it has really come into the open is with the Aes Sedai because I haven't been inside the heads of any other characters who are either gay or bi. For the most part, in this world such things are taken as a matter of course. Remember, Cadsuane is surprised that Shalon and Ailil were so hot to hide that they had been sharing a bed even knowing how prim and proper Cairhienin are on the surface. Well, for many it is just on the surface.
