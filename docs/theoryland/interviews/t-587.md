## [Entry #1](./t-587/1)

#### Sarayne

Q & A Session

## [Entry #2](./t-587/2)

#### Question

Do we see Verin in
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know what you're trying to figure out. (Who's Nakomi?) R.A.F.O. (Read And Find Out.)

## [Entry #3](./t-587/3)

#### Question

Since his epiphany, does Rand recite his list any more?

#### Brandon Sanderson

R.A.F.O. because we don't really see much of what Rand is thinking in
*Towers of Midnight*
. We are saving that for the next book.

## [Entry #4](./t-587/4)

#### Question

What is up with the red veils? Have we seen that before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The red veils are a complete R.A.F.O.

## [Entry #5](./t-587/5)

#### Question

Do we see someone get turned by 13 Aes Sedai and 13 Myrddraal in this book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

R.A.F.O.

## [Entry #6](./t-587/6)

#### Tower Guards

(It was at this point Brandon said we had the longest running set of R.A.F.O.s.)

## [Entry #7](./t-587/7)

#### Question

Can Rand still access the True Power since his epiphany?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not going to answer that!

#### Footnote

Brandon said elsewhere that he can
[still sense it](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#155)
, which means he can still use it, and simply chooses not to.

## [Entry #8](./t-587/8)

#### Question

In the early books, when Mat speaks in the Old Tongue without realizing it, he speaks with a certain voice that seems different from when it happens in
*Towers of Midnight*
, why is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The simple answer is that Mat is now getting more comfortable with who he is and the memories in his head, so it's coming out smoother now. Some of the difference is that the earlier books were completely written by Robert Jordan and I can't know what he was thinking at the time he wrote them.

#### Alan Romanczuk

Also, the Old Tongue is constantly shifting and idiomatic. It is very fluid, and certain words can mean more than just one word. There will be a lot more of the Old Tongue in
*A Memory of Light*
and the Encyclopedia. (Old Tongue is one of Alan's specialties!)

## [Entry #9](./t-587/9)

#### Question

Is Padan Fain going to turn out like Gollum?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he is not going to be like that. I am aware of the comparisons, and I am trying to distance him from that. The scene in
*Towers of Midnight*
with Padan Fain was originally written differently, and when I submitted it to Harriet she said, "Oh no, he's much crazier than that!" So I changed it accordingly.

## [Entry #10](./t-587/10)

#### Question

How is it writing from someone else's outline as opposed to your own?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's easier than I thought. I base my outlines off focal points and build backward to what would make that scene happen. RJ would work on scenes he found important and write them first. And so the notes that I was handed were list of important scenes without any connecting material. But in a lot of cases, the very important scenes were either indicated to me or written completely or left with a line or a paragraph or a dictation telling me what to do. And when I built this it fell very naturally into my type of outline. I have complete creative control, so long as I can convince the rest of Team Jordan.

## [Entry #11](./t-587/11)

#### Question

What exactly does
*Mah'alleinir*
mean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It means 'He who Soars'.

## [Entry #12](./t-587/12)

#### Question

Why do Mat, Perrin and Rand always stop the swirling colors when they have visions of each other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Their personalities. A piece of them still feel that they are still those small village boys and don't want to be involved. It's the nature of the beast.

#### Maria Simons

And sometimes they see things they really don't want to see!

## [Entry #13](./t-587/13)

#### Question

Do you already have an outline for
*A Memory of Light*
? Is it partially built or do you have to do the whole thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's partially done. I have an outline, but Team Jordan hasn't read it yet. They will in March. I am also going to read through the entire series again before I start the last book.

## [Entry #14](./t-587/14)

#### Question

Will people just be able to win at 'Snakes and Foxes' all the time now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nothing has fundamentally changed in the game. Interpret the end of the book how you would like!

## [Entry #15](./t-587/15)

#### Question

Where is Bela right now?

#### Maria Simons

The last time we saw her was when Siuan rode her when going to rescue Egewne. She is probably in the Tower stables.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harriet tossed in an ominous, "She's, of course, communing with the Dark One!" (Joking, of course!)

## [Entry #16](./t-587/16)

#### Question

Have there been any female
*ta'veren*
?

#### Maria Simons

None in the main series, but they can be. Some people think Egwene may be
*ta'veren*
, but I don't think she is. (A fan pointed out that someone would have seen her as
*ta'veren*
and Maria agreed that she is not.)

#### Alan Romanczuk

The Dragon is always a man.

## [Entry #17](./t-587/17)

#### Tower Guards

Q & A from the table

## [Entry #18](./t-587/18)

#### Question

Will you be doing a signing in Toronto next year?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I wanted to do an entire Canadian tour next year.

## [Entry #19](./t-587/19)

#### Question

What have you written and what has RJ written? Will you publish the outline?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd love to, but it's up to Harriet!

## [Entry #20](./t-587/20)

#### Question

Do you intentionally put a character that everyone seems to hate in every book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Sometimes your friends annoy you and sometimes you get along. Different characters appeal to different people, and sometimes at different times.

## [Entry #21](./t-587/21)

#### Question

RJ was able to write the fighting and military scenes so well because of his military background. How do you deal with those scenes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I rely a lot on Alan, and I read a lot of military history.

## [Entry #22](./t-587/22)

#### Question

What was your favorite non Wheel of Time book to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say
*The Way of Kings*
.

## [Entry #23](./t-587/23)

#### Question

Has anyone called you Branderson?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It has been heard.

## [Entry #24](./t-587/24)

#### Question

Does Rand sheathe the sword in the Last Battle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know I'm going to R.A.F.O. that!

## [Entry #25](./t-587/25)

#### Question

When you were just another reader of the Wheel of Time was there anything you didn't like?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was not a big fan of Cadsuane.

## [Entry #26](./t-587/26)

#### Question

Which kind of Misting would you want to be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A Coinshot so I could jump around.

## [Entry #27](./t-587/27)

#### Question

Can you give us a hint on who the second woman will be in Rand's circle? (with
*Callandor*
)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not really, but I can give you a tiny bit of information. She has already been introduced.

#### Footnote

[It's Moiraine.](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=766#4)

## [Entry #28](./t-587/28)

#### Question

How's your hand doing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Pretty good. It was sore after the first few days, but I'm used to it now!

## [Entry #29](./t-587/29)

#### Question

Did dragons ever exist in the Wheel of Time? Are they actual mythological creatures? (In the Wheel of Time)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The creatures don't exist in life. They know the symbol is a dragon, but they don't know where it came from. Maybe it's one of those things where the symbol remained, but the meaning was lost.

## [Entry #30](./t-587/30)

#### Question

What was the most exciting/shocking thing you found out when you got to read the notes?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Verin!

## [Entry #31](./t-587/31)

#### Question

Can I shake your hand?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sure!

## [Entry #32](./t-587/32)

#### Question

Will we see the Ogier again?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. There will be more of them in the last book. Not a lot but they will be there.

## [Entry #33](./t-587/33)

#### Question

Who is your favorite character to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aviendha, but she's also the hardest. I've just always liked her. Egwene was fun to write, particularly in
*The Gathering Storm*
.

## [Entry #34](./t-587/34)

#### Question

Is Aviendha a red-head or blonde?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Red-head.

## [Entry #35](./t-587/35)

#### Question

Are you having fun?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I am!

## [Entry #36](./t-587/36)

#### Question

Is Aviendha the only one to go forward in time through the
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As far as we know, yes.

## [Entry #37](./t-587/37)

#### Question

What do you get asked the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Who killed Asmodeanâ€”hands down.

## [Entry #38](./t-587/38)

#### Question

What's up with Szeth? (
*The Way of Kings*
)

#### Brandon Sanderson

He's very bound by his honor, but very messed up psychologically.

## [Entry #39](./t-587/39)

#### Question

Who makes it all the way to the end?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Bela.

#### Footnote

Explanation

.

## [Entry #40](./t-587/40)

#### Question

How long is the last book going to be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably about the size of
*Towers of Midnight*
. Not shorter, maybe longer, but about that size.

## [Entry #41](./t-587/41)

#### Question

There was a really strong channeler. Will she be back?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's likely.

#### Footnote

This might refer to either Sharina or Talaan.

## [Entry #42](./t-587/42)

#### Question

Will there be an overlying plot for the future of
*Mistborn*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but it may not be immediately obvious.

## [Entry #43](./t-587/43)

#### Question

How can you keep all the details in mind?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Part of it is how my brain works, but I also read some scenes that RJ wrote in a certain character's viewpoint before I write in their point of view.

## [Entry #44](./t-587/44)

#### Question

When will you come out with the next Stormlight book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A year after
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### Question

Are all the time lines caught up?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Black Tower is still behind.

## [Entry #46](./t-587/46)

I was scared of someone else writing this, but you did a great job!

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was scared myself! Thank you.
