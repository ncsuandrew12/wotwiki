#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's episode of Writing Excuses . . . wait, now that I think about it,
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
should also be eligible for a Best Related Work Hugo nomination. Huh . . . that would be an even more unlikely coup than
[our Parsec Award win last year](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/09/13/writing-excuses-parsec-award-acceptance-speech/)
. Well anyway,
[this week's podcast episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/01/03/)
discusses collaboration.

In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations, I talk about
[Lord Fedre and some spoilers](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/318/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Forty-Nine-Part-2)
as well as
[Vin's attempt to defeat the sedative](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/319/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fifty)
.
