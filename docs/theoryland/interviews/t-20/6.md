# [Interview #20: Stories from the LOC Signing Tour, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=20#6)

#### Grey Culberson

(question about series genesis)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ responded that the crux of the series was based on a disbelieving boy being told he was the savior of mankind, then that youth reluctantly realizing the truth of the matter but unwilling to admit it, and finally the boy assenting to the savior role and that only left puzzling out what he would do as the savior. When asked why RJ had chosen to go into so much depth and detail so as to confuse and overburden the reader, RJ responded, "It's all right there in front of you. Surely, something I've thought about for fifteen years and written about for nine is something you can work out over a weekend."
