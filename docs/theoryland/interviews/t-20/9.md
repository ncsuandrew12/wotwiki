# [Interview #20: Stories from the LOC Signing Tour, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=20#9)

#### John-Mark Turner

RJ was very patient and enthusiastic. He looked different than the picture mostly due to the dark tint in his glasses.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ also mentioned being unable to attend West Point due to poor vision in his left eye. Shannon Faulkner and the Citadel...he feels she should not be allowed to attend the Citadel because she lied on her application by not revealing her gender. He also feels that single sex education is beneficial for both men and women. He said men tend to be more successful in a competitive environment while women tend to excel in cooperative environments (e.g., studies have shown that girls that go to all girl colleges have less math fear, stress, etc. than coeds). He also mentioned that he personally feels that the physical standards suffer at military institutions when women attend. He talked about himself being shot down in a helicopter and having to run twenty-five miles literally and anyone who would have been unable to do that would not have survived.
