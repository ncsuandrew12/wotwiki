#### Grey Culberson

What's the story with the limited editions?

#### Robert Jordan

So far there have been only limited edition of
*The Shadow Rising, The Fires of Heaven*
, and
*Lord of Chaos*
, however the publisher will be soon going back to the first three novels and will produce limited editions of those as well. According to the blurbs in the limited editions, RJ gets 25 of the less than 200 published but RJ refuted that saying he only signs them and then the publisher hands them out to important types. The publisher's 25 editions are lettered from A to Z (minus I) whereas the public editions are numbered. RJ expressed his disappointment in never getting limited editions to hand out and also his astonishment that people are willing to dole out the greenbacks it takes to purchase one.
