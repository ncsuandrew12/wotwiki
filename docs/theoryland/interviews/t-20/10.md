# [Interview #20, Entry #10]: Stories from the LOC Signing Tour](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=20#10)

#### Kris Quinn

Like you, John, I discussed \*P and said that I was one of probably dozens who had sent him one of those free subscription packets (I have no idea if \*P still does it). Turned out it was a revelation to him.

#### Robert Jordan

"I was wondering why I kept getting subscriptions in the mail occasionally!" And we had a whole discussion on the net, which boils down to that he wasn't really crazy about getting onto the nets (Compuserve, \*P, etc.) because he saw how addicting it is for a friend of his, but that occasionally he gets copies of stuff from the various nets...All in all, a REAL nice guy.

#### Footnote

\*P is probably supposed to be P\*, an abbreviation for Prodigy, which was a competitor of Compuserve, the main Internet Service Provider in the US at the time (before AOL).
