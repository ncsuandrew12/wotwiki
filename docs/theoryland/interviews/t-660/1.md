# [Interview #660: KOD Signing Report - Phoenix Hunter, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=660#1)

#### Phoenix Hunter

Even though I still have a signed, and mostly unread copy of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
sitting on my shelf, something compelled me to drive over to my local book store for the
*Knife of Dreams*
book signing. I got there early enough to hear Robert Jordan answer a few questions, including my own regarding whether or not he would take a break after finishing the Wheel of Time series (short answer, no).

However it was about two hours later when I finally got to step up and get my copy signed that I asked the one question I hadn't thought of asking until the moment he turned his head up to receive me.
