# [Interview #282: Robert Jordan's Blog: NO CHAMPAGNE YET, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=282#6)

#### Robert Jordan

By the way, I've seen posts various places suggesting that I've had Trollocs using gateways in previous books. I think this stems from the attack on the Stone of Tear where I speak of Trollocs and Myrddraal "leaping out of thin air." This was not meant to convey gateways—no openings in the air were mentioned—but rather the suddenness of their appearance. A cliche, I know. Later, in
*The Shadow Rising*
I think, I explained that they had been smuggled into the Stone using barges and wagons.
