# [Interview #282: Robert Jordan's Blog: NO CHAMPAGNE YET, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=282#11)

#### Robert Jordan

For those who think I have adapted some name or other from another novel or series of novels, I have not. The names come from my head, from mythology and legend, from history, from the foreign news, often with a twist I give them to make them less a reflection of reality or less familiar. But never from anyone else's novels. Never.
