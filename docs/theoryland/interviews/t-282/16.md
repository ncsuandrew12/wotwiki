# [Interview #282, Entry #16]: Robert Jordan's Blog: NO CHAMPAGNE YET](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=282#16)

#### Robert Jordan

That's about it for now, guys. Liston took the first round on points, but the bell has rung for the second round. I just have to keep my hands up, keep the left jabbing, use the right to work the head and the short ribs. I am going to take this sucker down. You can bet on it.

Talk to you again soon.

RJ
