# [Interview #282: Robert Jordan's Blog: NO CHAMPAGNE YET, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=282#5)

#### Robert Jordan

For Richard Scholten, I have never discussed anything whatsoever with Terry Goodkind. I suggest that you check the publication dates of his books and mine. Of course, he says he has never read me, or so I'm told, and I would never contradict a statement like that. Just check out the pub dates on his books, and the pub dates on mine, those that contain the similarities you speak of.
