# [Interview #219: Radio Dead Air Interview, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=219#2)

I should probably ask a question first: If you can't tell, this is my first weekend to be doing these interviews, and I've enjoyed it immensely. You've been interviewed by many different people about the Wheel of Time series and the like. What thing would you tell anyone approaching your series for the first time about it?

#### Robert Jordan

Start with a book called
*The Eye of the World*
, because if you start anywhere else, you will get twenty pages, and say, "I don't understand who these people are. I don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it," and you will throw the book down in disgust and frustration. And you can find
*The Eye of the World*
at any bookstore, but if you can't find it, they'll order it for you.

That makes sense.
