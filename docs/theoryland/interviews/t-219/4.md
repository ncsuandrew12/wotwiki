#### Glas Durboraw

What influences you and your writing? Can you pinpoint anything in particular?

#### Robert Jordan

I believe the major influences on my writing
*style*
were Jane Austen, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Louis L'Amour, Robert Heinlein, and John D. MacDonald. They also happen to be my favorite authors of all time, but I believe they probably had the biggest influences.

#### Glas Durboraw

Sounds like very notable influences.
