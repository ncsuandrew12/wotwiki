#### Glas Durboraw

Where are you both from?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, we both grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. We live in a house that was bought by her grandmother in the 1920s because she had been widowed, and she thought this house was small and manageable, and that house that she'd lived in was too big for a widow. And people laugh when we tell them that, and we laugh bitterly, because it's
*not*
a small house, and it's a handful to keep up with.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

We paint it one side at a time.

#### Robert Jordan

Well, because painting all four sides of the house at once is a major expense. Major, maaaaajor.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

And it's [?], so it has to be painted every now and again, particularly since they took the lead out of house paint. It doesn't stick any more the way it used to.

#### Glas Durboraw

I remember the houses of Charleston, when I lived in Columbia, SC, and that is a beautiful area.
