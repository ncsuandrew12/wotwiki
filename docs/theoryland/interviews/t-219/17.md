# [Interview #219, Entry #17]: Radio Dead Air Interview](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=219#17)

#### Glas Durboraw

Well thank you all very much for your time; I greatly appreciate it. Again this is Glas with Nash Bozard's Radio Dead Air, and we've just been interviewing Robert Jordan and Harriet McDougal, his wife, who make up a writer and author team well-known to many of Nash's readers...uh, listeners. Readers/listeners...why do I keep making that mistake?

#### Robert Jordan

Well, you called us also a writer-author team.

#### Glas Durboraw

Oh, god.

#### Robert Jordan

We're a writer-editor team.

#### Glas Durboraw

Oh, NO! Sorry!

#### Robert Jordan

It's okay; you can edit it.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

We knew what you meant.
