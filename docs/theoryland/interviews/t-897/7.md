So . . . While the plane was landing, I had a great idea for fixing
*Death By Pizza*
, a novel I abandoned a few years ago. NOT RIGHT NOW, BRAIN.

Yay!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289159899944996864)

Lol. Have you even read that one?

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/289160469367906304)

No. But I wanted to react anyway.

You and your ideas on planes! Isn't that how
*Legion*
got started?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289159564367114240)

Yeah, traveling does that to me. Mistborn started while I was driving on a road trip.

Given I don't know anything about you besides the fact that you're a ridiculously talented writer, that title and you don't seem in-sync.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289159734190297088)

Heh. It was one of my "breather projects." Stories I free-write (rather than planning in detail) between larger books.
