Warning: Churchiness follows! Just saw Bruce R. McConkie's
[final testimony](http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1985/04/the-purifying-power-of-gethsemane?lang=eng&media=video)
(from back in 1985) for the first time. Wow.

Amazing, isn't it? AMAZING. We watched it when I was in the

.

Yeah. I'm surprised I missed it. 18 months of cancer, this, then dead in about a week. Gave me chills.

Oh no, no church for me. I might fall asleep. Oh man, I'm horrible.

Lol. :)

I'm super surprised you haven't heard it before. It's, like, everywhere in the Church.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288187922505666560)

Yeah, I've heard it mentioned—but just never watched/heard it.
