# [Interview #897: Twitter 2013 (Non-WoT), Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=897#4)

I have yet to meet an SFF writer who thinks they could have done a better job finishing the WoT than @BrandSanderson has done.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288754319585579011)

Thanks, Brent. And congrats on making just about everyone's "best books of 2012" list. You deserve it.

Jumped on the internet on the plane flight. Thought "I'll check my email quickly." Ten billion new emails. Oh, right. New book out . . .

Sorry, I was overly excited about the book. My bad.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288816786290405376)

Ha. No, it makes me feel loved. Thanks! Unless you sent them all. Then you are scaring me.

How do you handle that? Interns? You can't possibly read them all yourself.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289087740266549248)

I try to at least look all of them over. Most can be answered quickly with a pre-written email.

HUMBLEBRAG SOME MORE, BRANDON.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288799166237388802)

WHAT DO YOU KNOW? YOU'RE JUST A DIRTY SELL-OUT! SCALZIIIII!!!! :)

#### [Christopher Turkel](https://twitter.com/zizban/status/288802857124253697)

I am taking bets on the impending @scalzi and @BrandSanderson knife match.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288804549643345921)

Scalzi writes SF. He'd bring a laser rifle. This is why I only taunt him from 30k feet in the air.

#### [John Scalzi](http://twitter.com/scalzi/status/288805413024047104)

IT'S A COHERENT BEAM, FANTASY BOY. ONLY THE CURVE OF THE EARTH WILL SAVE YOU NOW

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288811739439583233)

. . . Did you just call me your "fantasy boy?" I don't quite know how to take that.
