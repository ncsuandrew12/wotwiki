Your website says at the Atlanta signing priority "may be" given to those who purchased the book from hosting store.

Seems silly to deny loyal fans a chance for lack of buying the book at one specific store.

I used to be pretty annoyed by these kinds of restrictions (which are placed by the store, not by me or the publisher.)

Then I attended a signing with well over a hundred people, for which the store had to hire extra staff, stay open late...

And rearrange their store to accommodate. They sold six copies and lost money since everyone brought their Amazon books.

I can see how stores get annoyed by such things. It didn't used to happen, but e-sales have changed the game.
