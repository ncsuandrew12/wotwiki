Atlanta airport Simply Books in the A terminal center has signed books! (Same for the B terminal Buckhead books from yesterday.)

That's cool. Have you ever gotten in trouble somewhere like that for signing your own books?

Once in a while, until I show the picture in the back. Never in a busy airport, though, where more authors visit.
