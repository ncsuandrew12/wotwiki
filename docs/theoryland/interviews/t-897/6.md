Just finished
*A Memory of Light*
, by @BrandSanderson. Very well written, and satisfyingly conclusive. NOW MOAR STORMLIGHT. #crackswhip

Wow. That was fast. :)

You weren't at the signing last night, were you?

#### [Chris Kluwe](http://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/status/289146360429703168)

Was
[doing the Colbert Report](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/422719/january-08-2013/chris-kluwe)
. :( And then I saw you posted the signed copies in the airport after I already flew back :(:(

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289149068347863040)

Ha. Good. I'd hate to have you come & not have me recognize you. (Mark Tremonti did that to me.) PM if you want a signed copy.

#### [Chris Kluwe](http://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/status/289149553620447232)

I'll catch you at another one so I can bring all the other books I need signed :p

Sounds good! Thanks.
