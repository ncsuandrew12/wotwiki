Traveling through Minneapolis/St Paul? I managed to visit and sign
*A Memory of Light*
at 3 of the 4 airport bookstores (Main concourse and C gates.)

Always been curious about stealth signings. Do you say anything to bookstore employees or are you kind of sketchy about it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289120225297846272)

Depends. I usually try to introduce myself, but if they are busy or don't look interested, I'll just sign and go.

Even though I don't live in the US, I love how you sign random copies of your books in airports. Shows you care! :)

I do this in the UK when I visit, but authors randomly stopping by happens less there, so I tend to get into more trouble. :)
