Passing through Atlanta? Signed copies of
*A Memory of Light*
at the Buckhead books in the middle of the B terminal. (Look in new releases, not sf/f.)

I think the UNSIGNED copies are going to be a rare collectible item!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290137649648381952)

Ha. I've signed around 5k copies so far. So you aren't far off. Don't you still hold the one-day world record, though?

#### [Kevin J Anderson](https://twitter.com/TheKJA/status/290144080292352001)

I think Dave Wolverton broke my record, and then Howard Stern. But I still have my Guinness World Record certificate.

Hmm. Well I did do 9,400 in two days before the launch of
*Inheritance*
.

#### [Kevin J Anderson](https://twitter.com/TheKJA/status/290176848346882049)

Next time have a Guinness official looking over your shoulder. I do NOT intend to break that record again.

Pretty sure Dave's got the record. Not sure on quantity.
