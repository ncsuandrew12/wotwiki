Guys, Jordan is a great man! He was most accessible and likable...he answered questions for over an hour and signed lots of books..think Dany R Snow presented four books to autograph and he good-naturedly signed all four.

Also notable was the presence of Luke Trugenberger who presented Mr Jordan. Luke is a really delightful and accessible person and if he keeps his promise will come to visit us on the Barrier...(At this point the purchase of his book is a must for me ... but I spent all my money on the 22 euro
*The Shadow Rising*
).

#### FOOTNOTEâ€”LINDA TAGLIERI

Both men are writers, but the poster probably means Luca, since the Italian translation of
*The Shadow Rising*
was published in 2004, the year of this post.

## [Entry #2](./t-677/2)

#### Dany Snow R.

Yesss!! I took books to be signed, prepared questions and took a photo of us together...that man is great!

Jordan gave an amazing answer to mko's first question:

## [Entry #3](./t-677/3)

#### mko

Will Rand al'Thor's internal conflict be resolved?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

## [Entry #4](./t-677/4)

#### Robert Jordan

I also asked Jordan if he reads [GRR] Martin and he said he does and enjoys him a lot... and the same for Luca Trugenberger...

## [Entry #5](./t-677/5)

#### mko

I asked Jordan: "Will Rand al'Thor sooner or later win the internal conflict that gripped him by the second book?"

#### Robert Jordan

On the American websites there is a term used in these cases: RAFO - read and find out.

#### MKO

I personally also asked if anyone has been interested in making a film inspired by his books, he replied that someone was interested in doing a film of
*The Eye of the World*
.... but for now there is still nothing concrete.
