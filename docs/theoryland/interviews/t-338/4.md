#### Brandon Sanderson

(For you trivia buffs, the longest book I've ever written was 306k long. It was
*The Way of Kings*
, which was the book I wrote right before Mistborn. The first draft of
*Well of Ascension*
was second, topping out at 258k in first draft form, though we cut it to about 245k before it went to press. So yes,
*A Memory of Light*
is going to be the longest book I've ever worked on. Though, since Mr. Jordan left large chunks of writing for the book—including much of the beginning and ending—I don't know that this will technically be the longest book I've written, assuming you count only words I myself wrote.)
