# [Interview #338: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Reader Mail: AMoL Progress Bar, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=338#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

To start off, I wanted to mention that the
[personalized
*Elantris*
hardcover](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/store/item/9/Signed-Elantris-Harback)
sale will end this Friday. (March 21st.) The books will still be for sale, but they'll jump from $22 to $25. So if you've been planning to get yourself a copy, this week would be a good time!
