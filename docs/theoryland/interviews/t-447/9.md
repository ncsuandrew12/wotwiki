# [Interview #447: BYU: TGS Midnight Release - Jennifer McBride, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=447#9)

#### Jennifer McBride

#### Brandon Sanderson

I only heard a couple, but one of them was "which Ajah would he be if he could pick an Ajah" and he answered: Brown. Given his love of the Borderlands, I was expecting Green.
