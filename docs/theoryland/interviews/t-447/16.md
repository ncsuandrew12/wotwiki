# [Interview #447: BYU: TGS Midnight Release - Jennifer McBride, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=447#16)

#### Katie

Why did you choose to be so open with your writing process?

#### Katie

It's because when I was trying to break into this business and learn to be a writer, the whole process seemed opaque to me. And I think that's because I was doing it before the era of the Internet really hit and now that we have this opportunity I figure I'll throw it out there and maybe what I'm talking about will really help other writers who are aspiring. And also on the other end of it, it gets a little frustrating waiting for books to come out and you never know what's going to happen and you never know what's going on. I figure with the Internet we have such a great opportunity to keep people in the loop to let people know what's going on. We don't have to be so shadowed anymore, so I want to make as best use of it as I can.
