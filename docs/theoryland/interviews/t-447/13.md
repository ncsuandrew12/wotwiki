# [Interview #447: BYU: TGS Midnight Release - Jennifer McBride, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=447#13)

#### Question

How extensive were RJ's notes about Lews Therin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

His notes about Lews Therin, I would say are about middle extensive, comparatively of different things that he has notes on. Less than some, more than others. They were extensive enough that I know enough things you don't know to make me excited, but not so extensive that you know, you are ever going to see a book about Lews Therin or anything like that.

#### Question

As a followup question, are the notes about Lews Therin the same notes about the voice of Lews Therin's?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know I think that's enough of a spoiler because there is still confusion or not confusion, wondering from people whether or not Lews Therin is the voice, I mean, of course Semirhage said that it is...Robert Jordan never really made that explicit himself. What I think and what you think may be different and so we'll just leave it. There are things about this in the book.
