#### Question

When will the book be released in New Zealand and South Africa?

#### Brandon Sanderson

New Zealand and South Africa I think are both part of the World English market which is the UK publishers job to get books shipped there. So it all depends on how quickly the UK publisher gets their edition out and how quickly they can get to shipping them. Australia should be very soon, however long it takes them, but it's not going to be a long time because I thought UK was releasing today. Alright? And South Africa should be the same.
