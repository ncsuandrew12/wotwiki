# [Interview #447: BYU: TGS Midnight Release - Jennifer McBride, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=447#18)

#### Question

Do you have any books coming out between the next two Wheel of Time books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have been working very hard on a book called
*The Way of Kings*
for about ten years now. It is the beginning of a large epic and I've always wanted to write one. I think it's almost ready. If the revisions work it will come out next fall. I don't think I will have one the year after that because the Wheel of Time is first priority. So, either between this one and the next one or between
*Towers of Midnight*
and
*A Memory of Light*
.
