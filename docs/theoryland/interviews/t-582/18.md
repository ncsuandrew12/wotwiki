# [Interview #582, Entry #18]: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#18)

#### Virginia

Okay. Well…I guess we'll just go into the pronunciations.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Well, our next little bit needs a little bit of a lead-in for our listeners who don't have access to our huge list of questions like we do. As part of our interview questions, we have a list of words, and we asked, "How do you pronounce each of these words?" And there are about 43 of them. There are probably some on here that don't need to be on here, and I know that there aren't some on here that should be, but these are the 43 that we came up with.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, Spencer got mad at me because I went and annotated the list, like…I gotta be exact, and he's like "No…"

#### SPENCER POWELL

I didn't get mad at you! I just took 'em off; I'm like, "Oh yeah, you're right; take that one off." Anyway. And so Maria, Alan…would you please go through the list and tell us how to pronounce these names and places?

#### Maria Simons

Okay, here we go. And I may, you know, be wrong on some. But others, I'm pretty sure of.

#### VIRGINIA

And feel free to add some in if something occurs to you as you're going.

#### MARIA SIMONS

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Do you want to go over the
*saidar*
/
*saidin*
thing we talked about?

#### MARIA SIMONS

In the glossaries of the books, Jim has it sah-ih-DEEN and sah-ih-DAHR, but I swear, I don't think he pronounced it that way; I mean you kind of give a little hint of the i but not much: sah-ee-DEEN, sah-ee-DAHR.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Yeah, he always seemed to be saying seye-DEEN and seye-DAHR.

#### SPENCER POWELL

I'm surprised at how many of those I thought I knew, but I didn't.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah. That's like, "Waait a second, that's not…but oh, I guess it is."

#### MARK

How do you pronounce the Traveling people again?

#### MARIA SIMONS

too-AH-thah-AHN.

#### VIRGINIA

There's something else with the double A there…

#### MARIA SIMONS

ah-tha-AHN mee-AIR. (Atha'an Miere)

#### VIRGINIA

Okay, great. Any others you can think of that are commonly mangled, that would have driven Jim crazy?

#### MARIA SIMONS

I think I've mentioned tah-EEM before, and egg-ee-AH-nin…

#### VIRGINIA

dee-MAN-dred? dee-MAHN-dred? DEE-man-dred?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Ehh...dee-MAHN-dred, I think…but I wouldn't
*swear*
dee-MAHN-dred. [glossary: DEE-man-drehd]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Pretty straightforward.

#### VIRGINIA

How about all of the Forsaken? A lot of them often get mangled, or a few. GRIN-doll?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Grindle, is how I say it. [glossary: GREHN-dahl] And it's interesting, just looking at a thing, and I pronounce CADD-in-soar (
*cadin'sor*
) wrong. [glossary: KAH-dihn-sohr]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Oh really?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah, because it's supposed to be cah-DIN-soar. [It's not, according to the glossary.]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Okay, because I say it the way you say it.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, I think… [inaudible] so that makes sense.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Oh! ish-AH-may-el, and SAM-may-el. [glossary: ih-SHAH-may-EHL, SAHM-may-EHL] [When RJ said it, the 'may' part was more like the German 'Mai'.]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yes. Those are really common mistakes; I hear that a lot.

#### VIRGINIA

Ben [?] was right; we had that famous tagline from the original podcast, and we had this thing…I think, "Sammael was pretty buff!" [laughter] We used that a lot, and it sort of went away when he did, I guess.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Another one that I have lots of problems with—and I can't believe I didn't get it on the list—but is the GOLL-um (
*gholam*
), or the…I can't even pronounce it right now.

#### MARK

GO-lem?

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yeah, the GO-lem, that's chasing Mat.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Yeah.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Gollum.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Gollum?

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, it's Gollum! [crosstalk]

#### MARIA SIMONS

I am not absolutely sure, but that's how I say it, so…

#### VIRGINIA

What about some of the other Seanchan beasts that made me think of, the
*grolm*
, then there were two of the others that…

#### MARIA SIMONS

ROCK-in (
*raken*
), and TOE-rock-in. (
*to'raken*
)

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, and then there was another one, the um…

#### MARIA SIMONS

*Torm*
…the book is right in front of me…

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, maybe it was the name of that…oh, Suroth's pet!

#### MARK

*S'redit*
?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh yes, that thing. I can't remember… [crosstalk]

#### VIRGINIA

Mandra…Mandragal?…Almandragal.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

The LOW-par (
*lopar*
)?

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, the lopar. Almandaragal was his name, or something like that?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Something like that. I would have to look it up.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

It was a LOW-par (
*lopar*
), wasn't it?

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah,
*lopar*
. I think there was another one that I couldn't…maybe I'm just hallucinating. [laughs]

#### MARIA SIMONS

Let's see…

#### VIRGINIA

I'm sure there's a zillion others I'll think of after you're off the air here with us…

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Oh, s'RED-dit (
*s'redit*
) is another one. Remember the elephant-like creature?

#### MARIA SIMONS

*Corlm*
, C-O-R-L-M (I like that word).
*Torm*
…that's all I can find.

#### VIRGINIA

What about Tuon's new name as Empress?

#### MARIA SIMONS

for-too-OH-nah?

#### VIRGINIA

Fortuona, okay. I'm not sure how else you could pronounce that, but I've been wrong before, so...

#### MARIA SIMONS

That, I'm assuming is right; I'm pretty sure I heard Jim pronounce it that way, because that was his choice of name.

#### VIRGINIA

There must be something else; there seems like a million things, and that I didn't add enough to the list.

#### MARIA SIMONS

OH-geer…

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

moe-TIE? (???)

#### VIRGINIA

Oh! What about—speaking of historical figures—LAH-tra…poe-SAI? Or poe-SAY? deh-KYU-meh? (Latra Posae Decume)

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Oh yeah, LA-tra (LA rhymes with laugh)…

#### VIRGINIA

I got the Latra, but I'm not sure about the second and third names.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Boy.

#### VIRGINIA

It's P-O-S-A-E, and then D-E-C-U-M-E.

#### MARIA SIMONS

po-SAY-uh deh-COO-may.

#### VIRGINIA

deh-COO-may, okay. [crosstalk]

#### MARIA SIMONS

That's totally off the top of my head. I see it (?) and think it, anyway. po-SAY-uh deh-COO-may, yeah.
