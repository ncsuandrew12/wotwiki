# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#13)

#### Mark

I actually have a question that leads more onto the line of channeling and weaves—and I think this might have been yours, Virginia, but it's also been tickling the back of my mind for a while. Why is that no other channelers have rediscovered any lost weaves—like they did with Traveling, Skimming,
*cuendillar*
,
*real*
Healing, and all that fun stuff—before the Wondergirls?

#### Maria Simons

Well, we don't really know no one did. If they did, they didn't share it, sure. You know, not all channelers are Aes Sedai, and even Aes Sedai don't always share things.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, they keep a lot back.

#### MARIA SIMONS

The Blue Ajah, you know, has all its little secret weaves, and I'm sure all the other Ajahs do as well. And two, there's always the whole thing that, 'the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills', and sometimes the Wheel weaves out what it needs, and with the Last Battle coming, it needs all the help it can get…so the really talented people, the really
*ta'veren*
people, they come out again. That's for most of them. For Healing, maybe there's a different answer. Aes Sedai…they know how to Heal people, and that's the way they do it, and they don't need to know anything better! I mean, it's just Aes Sedai being Aes Sedai. They think they know what they're doing, so they don't look for a better way to do it.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

And if they
*have*
discovered a better way to do it, they're probably not sharing it with other people, because every Aes Sedai is looking for an advantage over the others.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Right.

#### MARK

Oh, okay. So then that sort of partially answers the next half of my question, which is: How did some of these weaves get lost in the first place?

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, my favorite rant. All the Aes Sedai woke up one morning with amnesia. How did I Travel? I can't remember.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Well, part of it…I mean, I was reading, of all things, the Big White Book, and you know, the Breaking lasted a really long time, and things were
*really*
breaking. I mean, you might know how to Travel, but you didn't know if where you were trying to go was still there. You know, it might be in the middle of the ocean now, or on top of a mountain, so people probably
*weren't*
Traveling as much...and Aes Sedai were being killed right and left. There were all these crazy men, channelers wiping out entire cities, and the Aes Sedai women were trying to stop them, and sometimes they succeeded, and sometimes not…so, things really went to hell in a handbasket. Fast. And, you know, if a woman knew how to channel and she couldn't find anyone else who had the strength to channel, she couldn't really teach anybody to channel.

#### VIRGINIA

That's true.

#### MARIA SIMONS

To Travel, is what I meant to say.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Yeah, there was a time of course when the White Tower wasn't there. You know, the White Tower was a recent innovation in the grand scheme of things, and so the Aes Sedai after the Breaking were everywhere, so there wasn't that institutional memory in all things at that point, and things were lost.

#### VIRGINIA

So the Hall of the Servants, then, basically was a much looser organization than the somewhat hierarchical White Tower…

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Mmhmm.

#### VIRGINIA

…than we have now.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Mmhmm.

#### VIRGINIA

So we have a sort of central storing place for knowledge, or anything like that.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Right.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, think of what would happen to us if there was a horrible disaster that wiped out the internet. We would lose all of our knowledge except for, you know, the stuff that we still have in books. But you know, a good portion of our knowledge and communication that is electronic now would be gone.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

But this podcast would remain in people's hearts. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Well, you got me on that one, Maria, because if my computer was suddenly taken away and there were no others to replace it, I think I would probably have the equivalent of amnesia. It's my plastic brain, and I really need it.
[laughter]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I've always thought that the lost talents were related to strength, because the modern Aes Sedai are weaker than the Age of Legends Aes Sedai, and a lot of these rediscovered weaves require a certain level of strength that just doesn't exist in those Aes Sedai.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Right, and also talent, because to do this Healing, you have to have a certain Talent for Healing. To make
*cuendillar*
...Janya couldn't make
*cuendillar*
worth a darn, and…she didn't have that Talent, so if somebody knew it, but there was nobody they could teach it to, it's gone!

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah.

#### MARK

Well, the thing is though…leading up to that comment: remember in—I believe it was
*Crossroads*
, but it might have been
*Knife of Dreams*
—when Sorilea (soar-ih-LAY-uh)—I have no idea if this is how it's pronounced...

#### MARIA SIMONS

(soar-ih-LEE-uh)

#### MARK

She taught Cadsuane how to Travel, even though she couldn't make the weave work herself. So just because you don't have the strength to make the weave finish doesn't mean you can't form the weave anyway.

#### MARIA SIMONS

That's true, but...okay. We've got our nameless Aes Sedai after the Breaking, and she's found a little crew of people, and none of them are strong enough to Travel. Well, she's going to show them how to do it anyway and hopefully one day they'll find somebody strong enough but, you know, they never do. So we've got the same thing, and you know, sooner or later it's going to…if you can't actually use it for anything, you're going to put it aside and not pay any attention to it, and it will get lost.

#### VIRGINIA

Or, by the time that bunch of people finds someone who is [strong enough], it might have gone through several iterations and they might have the weave just a little bit wrong, so that it doesn't work either.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

And—correct me if I'm wrong on this—but I don't think it's possible to write down how to do a weave. I think it's something that you have to learn through demonstration. You can't just write it down, and be like, 'Well, I'll put this on the shelf, and some day a hundred years from now someone will come along and pick it up and figure out how to weave...whatever from this. I feel like you have to be
*shown*
how to do a weave.

#### MARIA SIMONS

That is...I mean, that's how they do it. You know, the novices don't run around with heavy books; they run around being taught by actual people. It's my belief that writing might could give clues or something, but you have to be able to show it or work it out on your own.

#### VIRGINIA

Of course, I was going to say they could just check on YouTube and find out how, but then, would the One Power weaves even show up on video?
[laughter] If they even had that...

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh, that's a good question!

#### VIRGINIA

I actually was just wondering about that; I wonder if any these things—I'm sure that the effects would—but I presume that if most non-channelers can't see weaves that probably there's nothing there for a video to pick up, either...but it's an interesting question.

#### MARIA SIMONS

That is.

#### VIRGINIA

How to detect channeling: Whip out your camcorder!
[laughter]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

With a wi-fi finder.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, okay. I'm going to be good now. That would be too funny. It's a shame Jessi couldn't be with us. She really wanted to be, but she had to work, and couldn't get off. One of her favorite premises is, you know, how drastically the Wheel of Time story would all be changed if they had access to cell phones and texting and the internet and everything.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh yeah. There would be no story.

#### SPENCER POWELL

They do though! Elayne has the communication
*ter'angreal*
. They
*have*
cell phones...ish. They just don't use them! [laughter]

#### MARIA SIMONS

Give 'em time.

#### VIRGINIA

I sort of [?] a couple of the guys before one time when we were podcasting and I had to get up in the office; I was working and I had to turn a phone off, and I came back and I said "I just had to disable that callbox
*ter'angreal*
." And they said, "Oh, you are such a geek." [laughter]

#### SPENCER POWELL

It's true.

#### VIRGINIA

A 'dork' is what actually they said.

#### MARK

No, you are a geek, because dorks have no social status whereas geeks are more knowledgeable in one or two given fields, and since we are all major WoT nerds—we qualify as nerds, not dorks.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, we got some cred there anyway.
