# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#6)

#### Mark

While we're talking about non-existent or 'gone' people here, why don't I ask a question that's been irking me for about five or six books now. Where did Gaidal Cain go?

#### Maria Simons

Birgitte thinks he's been reborn into the world.

#### SPENCER POWELL

That's a nice answer.

#### MARK

No kidding.

#### SPENCER POWELL

*Birgitte*
thinks he's been reborn?

#### VIRGINIA

She's mooning over all the ugly boy-children she can get her hands on, thinking "Ohh, maybe this is him!"

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

But keep in mind the only way she thinks that is because she hadn't seen him for a while in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
before she was yanked out by Moghedien. So we don't even know if that's true, do we? (I just threw that out for what it's worth.)

#### VIRGINIA

But she did always say that he was usually born before her, but we don't know how long in real world time, so he could be more than a child, hopefully. Or he could still be lurking in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
.

#### SPENCER POWELL

But there's no way he could be more than a child. Correct me if I'm wrong, Alan, but the entirety of the books we have isn't more than a couple of years, is it?

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, it's been about twenty-four months for the main characters. Alan would know for sure.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Yes, I'm not saying this is true. Well, of course I know, but I can give you various possibilities: he could be born as a child right now; he could still be lurking in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
; he could have been ripped out the same way Birgitte had been, in which case he would be an adult, right?

#### SPENCER POWELL

Unless he was dead. Because wouldn't it require someone to bond him after he gets ripped out? Wasn't that kind of the deal with Birgitte?

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Mmhmm.

#### VIRGINIA

Well, maybe he's stronger than she was…maybe he's…

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

There are a lot of possibilities.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Unless somebody has a really ugly Warder they're not talking about…
[laughter]

#### MARK

Not all Warders are beautiful. I mean…

#### VIRGINIA

Go check Myrelle's quarters. I know Myrelle has a real penchant for hiding extra Warders around…
[laughter]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, but she likes hers pretty.

#### SPENCER POWELL

She got Lan.

#### VIRGINIA

Lan's impressive, but I don't know if anybody would call him pretty any more. [laughter]
