# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#16)

#### Spencer Powell

How close was Verin's approximation on her accuracy in detecting the members of the Black that she had written in the amazing book that she gave to Egwene?

#### Maria Simons

It was pretty close. She did a good job.

#### VIRGINIA

That is interesting, because I'm still speculating that there may be other Black Ajah working around that haven't been discovered, and actually I have a whole load of questions I'd love to ask, but I just know they're all gonna be…you know, "Read and Find Out" answers. It always amazes me that Egwene spent so much time under Halima's thumb, in a way, that I can't believe that the only weaves that she laid on her were producing migraines. It makes you wonder if there isn't some hidden Compulsion weave going on there, that we'll find out later that maybe some of the Black Ajah in the White Tower could take advantage of. You know, there are so many things like that that I just know…

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah, I don't wanna go there.

#### SPENCER POWELL

I don't think that there's any Black Ajah left in the White Tower currently.

#### VIRGINIA

I wouldn't wanna bet my life on that. I don't think there are many.

#### MARK

Other than Mesaana who's hiding somewhere because she can defeat the Oath Rod, or so thinks Egwene herself in the end of
*The Gathering Storm*
.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Well, you still have the Black Ajah that escaped, too.

#### VIRGINIA

Mm-hmm.

#### MARK

Yeah, there was a lot of those that got out.

#### SPENCER POWELL

And we have Maria and Alan just sitting there going, "Yep, yep; you do." [laughter]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

No, I was just thinking that she was minimizing headaches. What a horrible thing for migraine-sufferers.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, listen…I get migraines. I have complete and total sympathy for anybody that gets migraines, but it seems to me like that probably wasn't the most…probably wasn't the only thing that she was doing to poor Egwene.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Well, the consensus that we…that was in the WoTFAQ when I was editing that article this summer was that Halima doing something to suppress Egwene's Dreaming talent so that she was not getting messages about the future any more, from whatever causes this to happen, and so the headache is the side-effect of that. I don't know if this is true or not; this is just the fan speculation from the WoTFAQ, but it is very telling that as soon as she gets away from Halima and is in the White Tower, her Dreaming ability comes back, because she had been having nightmares that she couldn't remember before about being chased by something, or something like that, and then when she gets into the White Tower, she stops having those nightmares, and she starts having the prophetic dreams again.

#### SPENCER POWELL

And she stops having headaches as well.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, and the headaches go away. And she does not make the connection in
*Knife of Dreams*
when she first sees this happen. I don't remember if she makes the connection in
*The Gathering Storm*
when she finds out about Halima's infiltration of the Salidar Aes Sedai. I have to go back and reread
*The Gathering Storm*
in the next couple of weeks, because I'm a little fuzzy on the details there.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Mm-hmm. Well, it certainly seems plausible. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

I'm not surprised that you guys have got this down to an art.

#### MARK

You guys give the perfect Aes Sedai answers.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I love it when I ask Maria and Alan things that relate to FAQ, and they'll just kind of smile and nod at me and go, 'That's a good guess!'

#### VIRGINIA

I was going to say another Aes Sedai answer, but then...I wonder if we’re going to get the Asha’man known for convoluted answers, but then they don’t have the oath rod to get around. They can say whatever they want to at all times.

#### SPENCER POWELL

They'll just blow you up and have done with it.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah. They are refreshingly direct about their methods.
