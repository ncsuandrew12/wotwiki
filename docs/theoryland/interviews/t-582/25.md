# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#25)

#### Andrew Gelos

Once again, I just want to thank Jennifer, Alan, and Maria for being able to join us today. It's phenomenal talking to all three of you; it is just amazing to be able to get to interact so closely with people who are so closely ingrained with the series. It's been a very true pleasure.

#### VIRGINIA

We sure do appreciate you coming out, and it's…

#### Maria Simons

It's been a blast; this has been fun.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

It's been an honor, and thank you so much for having us, and we hope to see you at one of the cons.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yes.

#### VIRGINIA

I hope so too. And we want to issue an open invitation, if you ever have, you know, any time at all, and you want to, we'll make it work if you want to talk with us again. Maybe after the next release or something…any time. Just…we'll make it work.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Okay.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Okay! And if you have a spare couch where you live…[laughter]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I have a spare bedroom.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yeah, if you wanna come to know where I know (?)…

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

It's a date.

#### VIRGINIA

I actually live in Nowhere, California (?) We're one of the last really rural areas in California; I joke that it's like the Two Rivers, only without the amenities. [laughter]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Without the water.

#### VIRGINIA

We don't even have an inn! We have no inn. [laughter]

#### MARIA SIMONS

Wow.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Alright! Well, thanks so much.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Thank you.

#### ANDREW GELOS

Thank you.

#### VIRGINIA

We wanna thank everybody who showed up for this; we really appreciate it.

#### ANDREW GELOS

And thank you Jennifer.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Oh, thank you! Gave me something to do this afternoon besides beat my head against that paper I'm trying to write. [laughter]

#### SPENCER POWELL

Then maybe we shouldn't have…no.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I'm actually ahead of schedule on this paper, so it's okay.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Alright.

#### VIRGINIA

Well, anyway. Thank you Alan, thank you Maria, Jennifer, Mark, Spencer, and Andrew for showing up, and I think that'll pretty much wrap up this episode, so this is Virginia, saying "May the Light illumine you", until we meet again, or until Brandon gives me my catch-phrase in the Old Tongue.

#### MARK

Alright, well thanks again for coming out. For Maria and Alan; you guys have been great, and thanks again for having me on the podcast; it's always great to be here.

#### SPENCER POWELL

And until next time, may you find water and shade.

#### ANDREW GELOS

And for myself, Andrew Gelos, and everyone here at The 4th Age:
