# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#15)

#### Mark

So, here's one that—I think this actually might have been yours, Spencer, cause it sounds like almost your mental acumen that would have asked this one—with the exception of Rand, who is Lews Therin Telamon reborn, are there any of the other characters that are reincarnations of prominent historical figures?

#### Maria Simons

There's Birgitte.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, but apart from Birgitte, yeah. I've always had this sort of fantasy in my mind that Nynaeve might be the reincarnation of Eldrene, the last queen of Manetheren, or something like that. And Mat, you know…gosh, he seems like...before he even left the Two Rivers, the Old Blood was coming out really strongly in him; it makes me wonder if he's not the actual rebirth of some extraordinary battle hero from Mathetheren. [silence]

#### MARIA SIMONS

Um...

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Interesting speculation. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Which is going to go nowhere!

#### MARK

We're not putting answers into their mouths! We're supposed to be getting answers from them, not giving them answers to give back to us! [laughter]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Oh, was that a question?

#### VIRGINIA

Well, sort of!

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

No, you're doing well; keep going. [laughter]

#### MARK

He's going to do what he always does; he's going to sit back and listen to all the answers until he finds one that he likes, and he says, "You know what? That was it!" [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Well, I guess this is something that we're just gonna have to hopefully read and find out...

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah...

#### VIRGINIA

…or I hope some of these questions are not going to be Brandon has said that Robert Jordan just said that 'this does not get resolved', you know...

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

That would be a shame. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

I'm not sure where that will leave us. Endlessly speculating till the Wheel stops turning…

#### MARIA SIMONS

There's no beginning or ending to the Wheel of Time.

#### MARK

Virginia will be reborn again once she passes and she will still be even more into WoT than she was now. [laughter] I can see it.

#### VIRGINIA

Impossible.

#### MARK

I can see it.

#### VIRGINIA

Physically impossible.

#### MARK

You'll learn your letters so you can read Robert Jordan in the cradle. [laughter]

#### SPENCER POWELL

I think you'll have a huge advantage, cause all the books will be out by then and you'll just be able to read 'em one after the other.

#### VIRGINIA

That's right, although I was going to say that I think I have the advantage, I was probably reading Robert Jordan when a couple of you guys were in the cradle.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yeah, probably.

#### ANDREW GELOS

Yeah, probably.

#### MARK

Well, not in the cradle, but I was itty bitty when the first book came out.

#### SPENCER POWELL

I think I was still in the cradle.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Wow. I feel old.

#### MARK

Yeah, that's cause he…that's cause you're just…

#### SPENCER POWELL

I am twenty. I'm not even twenty yet, so...

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh my gosh!

#### MARK

You weren't even born when the first book came out, buddy.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Oh, wow.

#### VIRGINIA

There you go.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Whoa.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh, wow.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, but they still put up with me, and I think I'm older than Cad-swayne. Is that right? Cad-swayne? Cad-swanee?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Cad-swayne!

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, yay! Whew. So far I'm...

#### SPENCER POWELL

Except that we know that Cadsuane is a couple
*hundred*
years old, which, you know, is older than the country.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah.

#### VIRGINIA

Okay, so I'm not
*quite*
older than Cadsuane...

#### MARK

You come close.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, I feel like it. Anyway, enough of that...

#### MARK

You're as old as Re-anne. Or is it Re-annie?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Re-AH-nah.

#### VIRGINIA

Re-AH-nah, okay.

#### MARK

Ah.

#### SPENCER POWELL

That's on that list.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, I've been saying that one wrong the whole time.

#### VIRGINIA

In general, are ending Es pronounced in the Wheel of Time names, like Reanne?

#### MARIA SIMONS

It varies. He wasn't really…I mean, sometimes yes, and sometimes…I mean, I was thinking about this, because if Cadsuane's final e was pronounced, she would be Cad-soo-ae-nah, like Macarena, and you could do a whole dance. But… [laughter] There doesn't really seem to be a rule. It's just how he felt that day I think, or how it sounded to him.

#### VIRGINIA

Some are, and some aren't, you know. It is kind of confusing, but we don't know for sure, if we're even right when we guess that, so you be the arbiter on this one. Unless, as Brandon said in our interview to him, unless Robert Jordan comes down to us in a beam of white light and sets us straight, some of these things may not ever be known for sure, so you have to tell us as best you can. Speaking of names that end in E , two that almost kind of strike me are, um…I started out saying muh-RELL, and then I kind of went to muh-RELL-uh, because of the presumption that the final Es were pronounced, so I don't know for sure which one is right on that; I go back and forth between that.

#### MARIA SIMONS

That's interesting. I say my-RELL. I'm not absolutely sure that's the way Jim said it.

#### VIRGINIA

Okay, what about lee-AHN, or is it lee-AHN-uh?

#### MARIA SIMONS

lee-AHN-uh is correct. That one is Leanne. And Reanne.

#### VIRGINIA

Yay!

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

I believe that Myrelle…it's my-RELL.

#### VIRGINIA

my-RELL?

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

my-RELL.

#### VIRGINIA

You pronounce the Y?

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Mm-hmm. Like 'my'.

#### VIRGINIA

Okay, good.
