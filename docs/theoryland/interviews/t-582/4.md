#### Mark

Okay. So, I got a question that actually goes all the way back to the very beginning of the series.

#### Maria Simons

Mkay.

#### MARK

Will we ever find out whose voice it was at the end of
*The Eye of the World*
?

#### MARIA SIMONS

[pause] [in a sing-song voice] RAFO! (ray-foe)

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, that's a RAFO. (raffo)

#### MARIA SIMONS

Score!

#### MARK

I figured, but I had to ask.

#### MARIA SIMONS

I wondered how long it would take.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Maria and I have spent some time trying to figure out different ways to say 'read and find out', so we're going to be trying out some of them today, and we'll see how it goes.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, great.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Oh, this will be fun. Let me see if I can get you another trial run here. Um...Asmodean?
[laughter]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Who's he?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah. Who's that guy?

#### VIRGINIA

He's toast, that's who he is.

#### SPENCER POWELL

No, Sammael's toast.

#### ANDREW GELOS

Yeah, I was going to say.

#### VIRGINIA

Well, I think he is too.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Um, if anybody sees the back of my car, they will see that
*I*
killed Asmodean. That's all I'm gonna say.
[laughter]

#### MARK

I thought it was Bela!

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I do like the 'Bela killed him' theory. That one is just insane enough to be true.

#### MARIA SIMONS

I like that Bela is the Neigh'blis.
[laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Terrible puns are always a good thing.

#### VIRGINIA

I love it.

#### MARIA SIMONS

And the master of the terrible pun is on this call.

#### VIRGINIA

Ahh.

#### MARIA SIMONS

In Jim's office.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Ahhhh.

#### VIRGINIA

Well feel free.
[laugher]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

I am, I am.

#### VIRGINIA

Pun away. Well, we've got two...you pronounce it 'raffo', right? Not 'rayfo'?

#### MARIA SIMONS

I say 'rayfo'. I don't know that there's a real pronunciation for that one.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

She says 'raffo', I say 'rayfo', so let's call the whole thing off.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, well we got two right off the bat. I don't know what else we're going to....well, probably everything.
