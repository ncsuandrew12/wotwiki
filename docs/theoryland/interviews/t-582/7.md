# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#7)

#### Spencer Powell

Speaking of which, what is the latest update on Lan, and are we going to hear anything in [
*Towers of Midnight*
]?

#### Maria Simons

Um…Peruse and Find Out. [laughter]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

If you look on the forums at Dragonmount, you can find a thread about the reading that Brandon did at DragonCon a couple weeks ago, and Brandon read us a portion of the prologue that was a Lan point of view.

#### VIRGINIA

Huh. I missed that.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

There's a real possibility he has saddle sores about now. [laughter]

#### SPENCER POWELL

Probably.

#### MARK

I would think so. I mean, he's been riding since World's End at Saldaea, so…I hope I said that right.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

He got as far as Kandor in the passage that Brandon read us.

#### MARK

Okay.

#### MARIA SIMONS

A pretty good distance.

#### ANDREW GELOS

It's actually kind of a circular tie-in with Lan having gone to Kandor in
*New Spring*
.

#### VIRGINIA

Mmhmm. He's come full circle since
*New Spring*
.
