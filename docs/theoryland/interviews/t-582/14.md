# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#14)

#### Virginia

So I guess the next question I want to ask is "Okay, how about those quadruplets?"

#### Maria Simons

How 'bout those Yankees? [laughter]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Alright, well there are...I believe there are four. Is that right, Maria?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah, four. Uh-huh.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Four. Alright, so what else do you want to know?

#### VIRGINIA

Wow. When are we going to find out about the quadruplets? I mean, we presume that they're working on the generation of them at some point here, but they're running out of time before the Last Battle. I mean, are these going to be born post-Tarmon Gai'don, or pre-Tarmon Gai'don, or are we just going to have to read and find out?

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Interesting question.

#### VIRGINIA

They are running out of time.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah.

#### SPENCER POWELL

And Aviendha's somewhere in the Waste, or on her way to the Waste.

#### VIRGINIA

Well
*now*
she is, but she was with Rand for quite a while, so...

#### MARIA SIMONS

[something about Min]

#### ANDREW GELOS

Yeah, but she didn't have her honor, remember?

#### VIRGINIA

I know, but that doesn't mean that she couldn't have hooked up, uh...you know, I don't know.

#### MARIA SIMONS

No, Aviendha [something]

#### VIRGINIA

[interrupts] That's what I'm wondering; that's what I'm wondering. Have they even started yet? If they're not started yet, I don't see how they could be born before Tarmon Gai'don, unless that's the odd thing, that she does a Star Trek sort of plot and has, you know, fully-grown...

#### JENNIFER LIANG

[something about MTV?]

#### MARIA SIMONS

I'm just gonna say, read and find out.

#### VIRGINIA

\*sigh\* Well you know we will.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Well, then.

#### VIRGINIA

When you tell somebody that, does anyone ever just go, "Well that's it; I'm done. I've had it! Never reading the Wheel of Time again!" No, noâ€¦they all come back and read.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yup, yup.

#### MARK

I tried that once. I put the book down for a sum total of about two days, and I'm like, "To hell with it; I gotta keep going!"

#### JENNIFER LIANG

It is a very oddly addicting series.

#### MARK

Yeah.
