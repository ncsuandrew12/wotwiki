#### Virginia

Another question that I've always wondered about—well, for a very long time anyways—is the idea of a channeler being able to be turned to the Dark One by the combination of thirteen Dreadlords—or presumably Black Ajah—channeling through thirteen Myrddraal, and I've speculated like everybody has who it might be, but can you tell us without a RAFO, have we yet met someone who has been turned against their will, and is there a way to detect it?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Not that we know of.

#### VIRGINIA

We don't know that we've met anyone yet?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Right.

#### VIRGINIA

Okay. Think they'll discover a way to be able to detect someone who
*has*
been turned?

#### MARIA SIMONS

Anything is possible. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

More Aes Sedai answers. But I guess I expected that!

#### MARK

Well, what do you expect? You are of the Brown Ajah there...

#### VIRGINIA

Green. I'm Green. If I were Aes Sedai I'd be Green.
