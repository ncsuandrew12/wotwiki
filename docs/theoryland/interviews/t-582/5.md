# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#5)

#### Virginia

Okay, so...my pet peeve is the famous library
*ter'angreal*
that was uncovered in Ebou Dar. Why is it that….is all that non-fictional knowledge ever going to come into play, and what's wrong with Elayne that she's not
*using*
it to find out some things that they probably desperately need to know? Or I guess she's using it as a doorstop.

#### Maria Simons

Well, 1) we haven't seen Elayne in a whole book; we don't really know what she's doing, and 2) she has problems channeling because of this pregnancy deal, and 3) everything's going to be in the Old Tongue and she's a little busy to sit down and translate documents.

#### VIRGINIA

That's true.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

But you don't understand the significance of that
*ter'angreal*
: Jim foreshadowed the creation of the Kindle. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, no!

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Mmhmm, he did. And actually, Elayne—right now as we speak—is in her bed reading fiction on that.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I bet they're dirty romance novels.

#### SPENCER POWELL

I was going to peg her for an urban fantasy fan.

#### MARK

No, no, no, no, no. She loves the Harlequins. Case closed.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, the Harlequins. Yeah.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yes, totally.

#### MARK

Either her or Aviendha, but one of those two is definitely into the Harlequin super-romance.

#### VIRGINIA

How can she get all excited about the cover art of Fabio when she's got
*Rand*
?
[laughter]

#### ANDREW GELOS

Have you
*seen*
the cover of
*Lord of Chaos*
?

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, I'm telling you! No comparison.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah, that one was nicknamed at our house 'Passion of the Aes Sedai'. I actually had to take the dust jacket off of that one when I would take it to school, when I was in high school, because I was like, "I
*do*
not want people to think I'm reading some kind of filthy romance novel in class."

#### VIRGINIA

Well, I'm thinking more of, what was it?
*A Crown of Swords*
? Where he's got the, uh…all he needs is some baby oil and a little less clothes and he looks like he's posing…

#### JENNIFER LIANG

We love fist-pumping, body-building Rand.

#### MARK

Don't make me get out the water bottle to squirt you ladies. Jeez…
[laughter]

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I have a big cardboard cut-out of fist-pumping, baby-oil Rand in my garage right now. I use it as a [decoration] at conventions. [Amusingly, it was stolen at JordanCon 2011, a few months after this interview.]

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, cool.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Is that cool, or is that creepy?

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Well, it's a little insane I think.
