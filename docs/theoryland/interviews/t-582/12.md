# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#12)

#### Spencer Powell

Well, because it is obviously expected, as we're doing an interview with a member of Team Jordan…Who was the last person to see Asmodean alive? [laughter]

#### Alan Romanczuk

His murderer. [laughter] [ba-dum-tish]

#### MARK

Everybody knew that was coming.

#### VIRGINIA

And who did you say that was, Maria?
[mumbling]

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Who indeed?

#### VIRGINIA

Well, we knew that wasn't going to be answered so…

#### MARIA SIMONS

No.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yup.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

It was a good one, though. Good try.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Well, thanks. Probably not as good as some of the Theorylanders would come up with, but I'm not at that level yet.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Theorylanders are scary good at thinking up those tricky questions.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh yeah.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yes. Very much so, yes.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah. Any time I think I know a lot about what's going on in this series, I go read their boards, and I'm like, 'Nevermind! There's no way I know all this stuff!'

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yeah.

#### VIRGINIA

I know. It's kind of humbling.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

[???] 'Are they even reading the same books I am?'
[laughter]

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah.
