#### AND NOW, FOR YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN...

#### Maria Simons

Want me to tell you about my dreams? I keep dreaming it's the Last Battle, and it's not just, you know, in the book; I'm
*at*
the Last Battle, and this is a recurring dream kind of thing, and like, one night was the Last Battle, and Napoleon showed up with his dirigibles to fight the side of the line (?), and we were trying to find out if they were hydrogen or helium, because it, you know, made a big difference.

#### VIRGINIA

Makes a difference, yeah.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

(?) talking to you…

#### MARIA SIMONS

Another night, Darth Vader—the original one, not Whiny Boy [laughter]—showed up to fight for the Dark One…you know, it just keeps going on and on, and it's fun. Sort of. Sometimes it's scary. There was one where we were fighting the Last Battle in a gated community, and Tam al'Thor showed up, and then we realized it wasn't really Tam al'Thor; it was the Dark One, and so we had to escape. And so we did, and then after that, here comes Wilson Grooms! And, you know, I love Wilson! Wilson is one of my favorite people on earth! And then we realized it wasn't really Wilson, and we had to fight him! And I had a sword, and I had to hit Wilson with—what looked like Wilson—with a sword, and it was just really scary! And unpleasant. And I was glad to wake up for that one...but usually they're fun. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

You must be a Dreamer!

#### MARIA SIMONS

Uhh…yeah, yeah; I dream. I had a dream once that...

#### MARK

I want whatever you're on. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, I was just thinking that. Send it here immediately!

#### SPENCER POWELL

I think it's called Wheel of Time.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yeah.
