# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#24)

#### Virginia

Now that…obviously no one can fill the hole that Jim Rigney did. I mean, no one can take his place. But we have Brandon now, and you're working with Brandon, but now it's a long-distance relationship. How is that working out? And he's such a maniac for work; I cannot imagine how any human being gets the amount of writing that he does done, and all the other things that he does.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I'm convinced he's a robot. [crosstalk]

#### VIRGINIA

He's an android, yeah; he's an android; I'm sure of it. He's a big cuddly android, but I think, you know…really suspect!

#### Maria Simons

He's pretty amazing, I mean…but the work ethic he has is just incredible. I mean…
*The Way of Kings*
and
*Towers of Midnight*
, the same year. It's amazing.

#### VIRGINIA

I know! And Alcatraz too, I think…and a tour! Two tours!

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh yeah! Two tours, and a couple of cons—or more, actually, than a couple. But the long-distance thing…you know, living in the future makes it easy, and we actually, here, all of us, um…older farts in Charleston made the jump to digital editing for
*Towers of Midnight*
which made it a lot easier than
*The Gathering Storm*
when we were still doing everything on paper.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Oh, wow! I didn't realize you guys did that all on paper!

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh yeah…oh yeah.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I can't even imagine how complicated it would be to do it on paper.

#### MARIA SIMONS

It was pretty, uh…it worked. We got it done, but we made [?], and it was still kinda complicated because I had no idea how to do some things, and I have to email, and Peter—Brandon's assistant—would tell me how to do it. Peter's great; Peter is
*fabulous*
, and…

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I know; I heart Peter.

#### MARIA SIMONS

I wish I could have been at DragonCon, just so I could have met him.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, me too.

#### MARIA SIMONS

But, um…you know, it's…it works. You know, we've got email, we email back and forth; occasionally we do the phone call; occasionally we actually get together, and it's...

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Yeah, probably the most difficult thing is the time difference, and…not only is he, what, three hours behind us, but Brandon does so much of his work, ah, in the evening, and in the early hours, and consequently doesn't get up at five in the morning…

#### MARIA SIMONS

That's usually when he goes to bed.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

…and so, if he has to ask us something quickly in the middle of work, or if we have to ask him something quickly, you know, we might have to wait for one or the other to wake up and get to the office.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

He might as well be in New Zealand, as far as the time overlap.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Exactly.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah. But, you know, we made it work.

#### VIRGINIA

Cool. Well, I think Peter's probably got Dream Job #2.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yeah.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh, I dunno, how do you keep up with somebody who's like that? He's just…I mean, just talking to him in person—and I'm sure that probably Robert Jordan was the same way—I think it's a little overwhelming. There's so much creativity going on, and you can see that the mind is working so fast, it's almost like two or three different things going on at one time. And you know it's not, but it just almost seems that way, and you can almost get a little overwhelmed just trying to keep up with the flow of ideas, you know.

#### MARIA SIMONS

And that's very true, with Jim, and especially Jim and Harriet talking together sometimes. [Alan laughs] You know, it would be like, "Wow. What…what? Wow." Because they're just so incredibly bright, and it was just…very cool.
