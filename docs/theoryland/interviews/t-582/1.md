# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#1)

#### Andrew Gelos

Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of the 4th Age. I of course am Andrew Gelos, and with me this episode is Virginia.

#### VIRGINIA

Hi, Andrew. It's great to be here as always, and also with us we have—back from the wild—Mark.

#### MARK

Hey Virginia. Thank you, and glad to be back. And with us we have Spencer.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Hi everyone. We have a great show tonight. We have several special guests with us tonight. Joining us tonight is the Amyrlin Seat of Dragonmount, responsible for JordanCon and the Wheel of Time track at DragonCon, Jennifer Liang.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I'm actually retired Amyrlin at Dragonmount; I don't do that anymore. But thank you.

#### ANDREW GELOS

And in addition to Jennifer being on the podcast, we are also very, very happy to have with us Team Jordan. First and foremost, Alan Romanczuk.

#### Alan Romanczuk

Hello everyone, from sunny Charleston. It's good to be with you.

#### VIRGINIA

Well it's great to have you here Alan, and also we have with us Robert Jordan's right arm and—I don't know how you would say...maybe the Amyrlin Seat of Team Jordan? I don't know—but anyway, Maria Simons, we're so happy to have you here with us.

#### MARIA SIMONS

I am so happy to be here! And I think Harriet would have to be the Amyrlin Seat of Team Jordan.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

Yes, totally.

#### MARK

Well, I guess that would make you the Keeper.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, Keeper of the Chronicles; there you go.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Yes. I am the Keeper, yes.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I could see Maria being a Keeper.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yes, it's really great to have you both here. Quickly, though, before we jump into our questions, we need to give our customary spoiler warning.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Alright, this is Brandon Sanderson, giving you a warning that this podcast includes spoilers. Spoiler alert! Don't listen unless you've read all the books. Otherwise, we will hunt you down and beat you up. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

Gotta love Brandon.

#### MARK

God, how funny that is.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh, that's great.

#### ANDREW GELOS

Yeah, honestly I think we've set it up pretty well. We'll be discussing almost anything that we can possibly think of to ask. We're on a limited time basis obviously, so without any further introduction, I think we'll just launch in, and try to keep it simple, and get as much as we possibly can, because I know I could probably fill up a couple of hours by myself in just random questions as they come to my mind.

#### VIRGINIA

Yeah, absolutely.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Okay.
