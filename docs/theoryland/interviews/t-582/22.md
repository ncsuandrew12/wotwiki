# [Interview #582, Entry #22]: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#22)

#### Spencer Powell

And secondly, I had forgotten about this until I checked my Twitter earlier this morning, but today actually is the anniversary of the passing of Robert Jordan…

#### Maria Simons

The third, yes.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh! I had forgotten that myself. That's scary.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Yeah. So, first off I think we should probably take a real quick moment of silence, and then after that, Maria and Alan, if you two would like to say something, anything to commemorate it for the podcast, we will get this out shortly so it won't be outdated. So, just a couple of seconds, and then if you two would like to say something.

#### MARIA SIMONS

"He came like the wind, like the wind touched everything, and like the wind was gone." And I miss him still.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Very much.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I think we all do.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Very much missed.

#### MARK

As do we all.

#### VIRGINIA

Well, there will never be another like him. That's all I can say.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

And I should say, that's the first time I've ever heard anyone purposely have silence on the radio.

#### VIRGINIA

Well, it'll be a first, I suppose. I think I've heard it done before, but...

#### MARK

We've done it before.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Really?

#### VIRGINIA

Ah, yeah.

#### MARK

Like when we first found out about his passing, we had a quick—like very, very fast…

#### SPENCER POWELL

We had a quick recorded moment of silence.

#### MARK

…and we had a quick moment of silence, exactly.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Hmm. Sweet.
