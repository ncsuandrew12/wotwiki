# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#2)

#### Andrew Gelos

One of the questions—and this is a really weird one, at least for me—I was wondering—and obviously we know that if it's pertaining too much to things that are going to be coming out in the books that haven't been released yet, we know that they can't be discussed, and that's completely and totally understandable—but I was really wondering: I've recently started yet another re-read of the series with my wife, and I got to thinking about the Horn of Valere (rhymes with full-AIR)...or Valere (full-EAR)—and once again, I sometimes flip back and forth between the way I originally heard it and the way it probably should be pronounced—but how does the Horn function? Is it actually an old
*ter'angreal*
, or is it completely unrelated to the One Power?

#### Alan Romanczuk

Hmm.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Okay...we don't really know. No one really knows. It's an ancient artifact, probably not a
*ter'angreal*
.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Excuse me, Maria, I have to interrupt for just a moment. I actually found some notes on this, in the bottom of Jim's desk.

#### MARIA SIMONS

Oh, really?

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

I don't know if anyone's interested.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh yes.

#### SPENCER POWELL

Just a little?

#### MARK

Please, please?

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

The Horn of Valere, as Maria said, it was created by mortals—we know that; Jim has said as much publicly—and the Horn was created in the Age before the Age of Legends, or at least one Age before; it was not known how far back. But I've discovered that the Horn actually was the original Horn played by Dizzy Gillespie. [laughter] It was manufactured by King—it was the silver flare model. And something happened after this Age...there was so much Bebop imbued in this instrument that it took on its own magical qualities, and when it was found during the Age of Legends, the bent bell was refashioned into a curve, and they put in the Old Tongue inscription inside the bell. [laughter]

#### ANDREW GELOS

That is awesome.

#### VIRGINIA

Wow. I never would have guessed that.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

Well, it's really obscure. The power of Bebop is unlimited, and it just transformed through the last couple of Ages, to get into Rand's world, with its current...now, originally, when he blew it, musicians would appear.

#### VIRGINIA

AH. Backup band.

#### ALAN ROMANCZUK

But because of the needs of the time, you know, it suddenly became, Heroes would emerge when it was played. So, that's all we can really say about it. Do you have anything else to add, Maria?

#### MARIA SIMONS

No.

#### JENNIFER LIANG

I can't wait until the Theorylanders get ahold of that.

#### VIRGINIA

Oh yeah. So now we know that the Wheel even weaves inanimate objects into the Pattern, and makes use of them as it wishes.

#### MARK

Now, that story I expect to see in the next Great White Book, version two. [laughter]
