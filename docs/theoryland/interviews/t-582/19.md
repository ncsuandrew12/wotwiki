# [Interview #582: 4th Age Podcast Interview with Team Jordan, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=582#19)

#### Virginia

I want to just throw something in at the last minute, because it just popped into my mind because of that, and I'm sure this is going to be another Read And Find Out. Can you tell us anything about the lack of Lews Therin's voice now that Rand has had his so-called 'epiphany' on Dragonmountâ€¦is that an actual 'merging' of the characters? Are we done with the voice of Lews Therin?

#### Maria Simons

I need to learn Old Tongue for 'Read And Find Out'. [laughter]

#### VIRGINIA

I'm still waiting for 'May the Light illumine you'! [laughs] I was hoping somebody'd pop up with that for the podcast, and that's how I try to close each episode, so that's why I asked Brandon for it. I'm just gonna have to hound him.
