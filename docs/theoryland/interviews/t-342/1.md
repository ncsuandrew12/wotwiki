#### Brandon Sanderson

Remember,
[the sale of
*Elantris*
hardcovers ends today](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/store/item/9/Signed-Elantris-Harback)
! Sometime during the day on Saturday (though, realistically, it probably won't get done until Sunday or Monday) we will be changing the price for the personalized hardcovers. (They'll go up from $22 to $25.) So, get yours today!
