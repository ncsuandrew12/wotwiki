# [Interview #730: KOD Signing Report - Congo Red Jr., Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=730#2)

#### Congo Red Jr.

I found Mr. Jordan to be a good guy overall, patient and quite funny. I went through the line a few times and got my wife to participate as well, so I got all eleven of first print hardcovers signed. Yay! His wife Harriet was downright cool; she and my wife talked extensively on whatever women talk about and seemed to get on fine. Well anyway thought I'd fill y'all in. Take care.
