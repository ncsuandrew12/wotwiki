# [Interview #730: KOD Signing Report - Congo Red Jr., Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=730#1)

#### Congo Red Jr.

Well I asked Mr. Jordan about
[this theory](http://www.theoryland.com/theories.php?func=5&rec=131&theo=2372)
, in brief, at a booksigning in Santa Cruz. I did this while getting my books autographed.

#### Robert Jordan

He said the Forsaken are using balefire to help unravel the Pattern. That was all he'd say on it, told me the books provide enough evidence for it.

#### CONGO RED JR.

At any rate I'm not sure whether or not this helps anyone's arguments as I haven't read all of them; y'all write too much.
