#### Question

Any news on the movies of the books?

#### Robert Jordan

He just got back from Hollywood where he was had extensive talks with the producers. It appears that they are about 8 weeks from a draft of the script. He was happy with the screenwriters and the plot summary. He had extensive input and veto/suggestion type powers, but he will not have any input into actor choices.
