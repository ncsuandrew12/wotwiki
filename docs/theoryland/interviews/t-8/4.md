# [Interview #8: KOD Signing Report - Karana Majin, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=8#4)

#### Question

During Moiraine's practice for the test for Aes Sedai, she works on a weave that produces a coin that is cool to the touch. She thinks the weave is useless. Is this some sort of component of the weaves that made Mat's medallion?

#### Robert Jordan

No.
