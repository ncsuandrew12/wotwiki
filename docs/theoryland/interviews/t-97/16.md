# [Interview #97: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#16)

#### Robert Jordan

Book timings:

—Four years to write
*The Eye of the World*
; the next five took 14-16 months each.

—
*A Crown of Swords*
took 22-23 months to write.

—The Guide to the Wheel of Time took 5-6 months; there was a lot of work he had to do on it that he didn't expect to need to do. I think he expected a few weeks of work from him directly, with it mostly being done by others.

—
*New Spring*
took 2-3 months.

—
*The Strike At Shayol Ghul*
was written from the perspective of a scholar trying to attract funding for a more complete version (i.e., grant money) and was his first piece of short fiction.
