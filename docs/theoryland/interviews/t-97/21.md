# [Interview #97: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#21)

#### Matthew Hunter

Lots of minor comments thinly veiled towards the net-jordanites. I got the impression he thinks we're a bit obsessive but appreciates it. Some of the more interesting ones:

#### Robert Jordan

—"I like the idea of Bela as a Darkfriend."

—"There is an alphanumeric code in the copyright page." He expects us to decode it shortly. Let's get cracking!

—"How do you know Mat isn't back as Cyndane?"

—"Any crazy rumors I can start on the Web are good."
