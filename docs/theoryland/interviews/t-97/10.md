# [Interview #97: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#10)

#### Mat

Who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

It should be "intuitively obvious". There ARE clues in later books. They may not be necessary, but they are there.

#### Matthew Hunter

I am not sure if he said "later" or "latest", though.

He does indeed mean "intuitively obvious" in the sense that his math teachers would use when describing a proof, as speculated on rasfwr-j. "I always hated that."
