# [Interview #97: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#5)

#### Matthew Hunter

I chimed in later on to ask if "there was a physical resemblance between Cyndane and a certain height-challenged Aes Sedai".

#### Robert Jordan

He said "We don't know yet."

#### Matthew Hunter

I think that means yes, which is interesting. If there hadn't been one, he could have said no, and he has written the descriptions of Cyndane ambiguously enough to prevent any proof either way.

#### Footnote

Matthew is probably referring to the
[theory](http://www.steelypips.org/wotfaq/1_dark/1.2_forsaken2/1.2.4_cyndane.html)
that Lanfear had been put into Cabriana Mecandes' body, which was later debunked by Maria. Cabriana wasn't described as short, though, so if he was referring to Moiraine, then of course this was debunked in
*Towers of Midnight*
at the latest (not that there was ever much resemblance there aside from height).
