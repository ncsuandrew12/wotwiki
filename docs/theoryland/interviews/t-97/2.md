# [Interview #97: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#2)

#### Matthew Hunter

The first "intuitively obvious" question was from someone else: The old standby, "Who killed Asmodean?"

#### Robert Jordan

He added that there have been clues in (at least some, maybe all of) the books published since then.

#### Matthew Hunter

I take this statement to mean that Graendal is the killer; she's the only one for whom the case could be called "intuitively obvious", as it is mostly built up through a process of elimination and a few supporting comments.
