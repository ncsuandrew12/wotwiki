# [Interview #97: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#4)

#### Matthew Hunter

The third was someone else again, and I didn't hear the question clearly, but I think it was about the weird Power effects. Assuming I heard correctly, this should support the Bowl theory, due to the lack of effects in Andor despite the gateway detonation and the timing of the effect first showing up. Of course, he didn't say so explicitly, but that is what would seem to be the intuitively obvious explanation.
