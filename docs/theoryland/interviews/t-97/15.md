# [Interview #97, Entry #15]: TPOD Signing Report - Matthew Hunter](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=97#15)

#### Robert Jordan

Someone asked about signing multiple books. Jordan said that the rule was that you had to go through the line for every two books, and that he would "enforce the rules with my bullwhip if necessary"; a bookstore employee(?) commented that it was more of a guideline really. General laughter and bullwhip comments ensued, culminating with "Just so no one asks, 'Can I fondle your bullwhip?'" from Jordan.

#### Matthew Hunter

(I didn't catch all of this. I regretted it. Oh well.)
