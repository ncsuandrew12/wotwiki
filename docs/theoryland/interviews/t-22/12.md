# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#12)

#### Erica Sadun

Erica asked Jordan about Shannon Faulkner, the female attempting to get into The Citadel.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan immediately said "She's a liar," and explained how she misrepresented herself on her application. The Citadel has an honor code that views lying as a very serious offense. He thinks the military is one role where men are physically more able to do the job, and if one can't meet the same requirements then they shouldn't be accepted. He frowned on the practice of West Point no longer having women march in combat boots. He mentioned that in Vietnam he had to run for twenty-some miles, and if he hadn't been able to make it he wouldn't be here today. He says in some fields though women would naturally replace men if tradition didn't keep men involved, such as law.
