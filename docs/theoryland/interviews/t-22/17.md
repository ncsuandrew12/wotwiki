# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#17)

#### [Daniel RoukÂ (18 October 1994)](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/msg/da92bee7eae49851)

There were some really interesting collector's items to be signed. One ex-Tor representative (who says he remembers you, Patrick) had Advanced Reading Copies from
*The Eye of the World*
.
*The Eye of the World*
's and
*The Great Hunt*
's advance copies were both nicely bound with cover art on them. From
*The Dragon Reborn*
on they are bound in yellow or red construction paper. The first three advance copies seem to be single-spaced single volumes. I don't know about the others, but
*Lord of Chaos*
's advance bound copy was double-spaced and in two volumes. Another fellow had a large fold-out map that was included in one of the advance copies. It was black and white, and Jordan said it is an early copy from which the modern maps were made. I noticed attractive drawings of several places along the border. One I think was Tar Valon.

#### Robert Jordan

The recent
[freebie first half of
*The Eye of the World*](https://p.twimg.com/ArXa4nHCMAMxxJr.jpg)
was the impetus that got his elder brother to read the books. Apparently his older brother doesn't read much fantasy, and hadn't read any of Jordan's books until he saw the freebie in the store and picked it up.
