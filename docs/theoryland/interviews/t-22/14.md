#### Robert Jordan

Jordan confirmed that this book [
*Lord of Chaos*
] is really much as people have said, the first part of a two-part story. (So what is a two-book series in a nine-book series called? Of course since he also said he hasn't finished the next book, or even really knows how far along he is, this may or may not be true.)
