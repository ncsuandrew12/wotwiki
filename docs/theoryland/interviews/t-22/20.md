#### [Robert JordanÂ (18 October 1994)](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/msg/da92bee7eae49851)

Jordan doesn't like his first book, but is scared to throw it away because he thinks his luck might be tied to it. He detailed how he sent it to a publisher and it was accepted. When he asked for a few minor changes be made to his contract, they sent a letter dropping him. Since he now knew he could write, he set about doing so.
