# [Interview #22, Entry #5]: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#5)

#### Daniel Rouk

Jordan answered any spoilers about the story pretty much as follows. First question where this occurred is below:

What about Jain Farstrider? Will we see him again?

#### Robert Jordan

"If, by the end of the last page of the last book you haven't read any more about him, then I guess there was nothing more to say."

He mentioned that he isn't going to offer any windows into the story other than the text. If it's not readily apparent, then he isn't going to illuminate it further. Thus no mind-shattering revelations about the plot here!
