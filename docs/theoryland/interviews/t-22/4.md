# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#4)

#### Daniel Rouk

No Jordan quotes are exact... I didn't write anything down or have a tape of it. (sorry)

#### Robert Jordan

Robert Jordan began writing after a pretty severe (the description grossed Erica out) knee injury kept him idle. He was in the government service at the time, and after using the time to write his first book, his boss thought he was faking the injury simply to write. Jordan was upset because his boss's boss believed that, and put in a resignation with two weeks notice. Upset that he was leaving, his boss asked him to stay, mentioning that he was needed on current projects. Jordan had cleaned up his desk and finished those however. The boss mentioned that he was needed on future projects. Jordan mentioned that he had submitted his resignation. The boss mentioned that if he quit Jordan would never be able to work in the government again. Jordan asked if he could have that in writing.

He says his wife disbelieves this ever happened, but Jordan swears it's true!
