# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#10)

#### Daniel Rouk

I asked how far along he is [with
*A Crown of Swords*
].

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan said he didn't really know, as he is constantly writing and cutting parts. He writes from the beginning of the story to the end, and then cuts and edits large chunks, pulling together threads. He doesn't even think about a working title, but lets the story determine it.

He says there will be at least three more books, maybe four.

Jordan knows the very last part of the final book, but doesn't know how long it will be till he'll put it in.

One humorous story mentions the quote saying he will continue writing until the day the nails are put into his coffin. One elderly lady apparently told him that she was a lot closer to that than he was so he had better hurry up.
