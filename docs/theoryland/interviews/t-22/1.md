# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#1)

#### Daniel Rouk

I just got back from the first Jordan signing, held at the Mystery and Science Fiction Bookstore in Atlanta. It was lots of fun! I arrived about 10 after 6 and was given a post card showing the cover scene from
*The Fires of Heaven*
, with a hand-writen number on it. (46)

Those earlier than I were awarded with poster-sized versions of the Randland map (new color one). I'll get one tomorrow or die trying!
