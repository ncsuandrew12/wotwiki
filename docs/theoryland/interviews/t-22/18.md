#### [Robert JordanÂ (18 October 1994)](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/msg/da92bee7eae49851)

Jordan reads voraciously, a book a night. He says if he sat down for an evening's reading he could probably put away two books the size of
*Lord of Chaos*
easily. When tested in grade school he was sent to the principal because the teachers were sure he had cheated. No one could read as fast as he did with as much comprehension as he had at that age. Jordan recalls that being called to the principal didn't upset him as much as not being apologized to afterward. Apparently the library where he grew up restricted children under twelve to the kids' department. This rankled the young Jordan, who read all he wanted to from that department in two days. He thus swiped books from tables and sat in a corner to read them. His main supply of literature as a kid was through his older brother. (10 years older)
