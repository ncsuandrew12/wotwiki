# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#24)

#### [Jared S. SametÂ (31 October 1994)](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/6IPEHsoWmEk/J1T2le3_juEJ)

Is RJ trying to insinuate that the Red Ajah is made up of lesbians?

#### Daniel Rouk

Someone (Erica?) asked this question at the first Atlanta Signing.

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan said that he doesn't know how this idea caught on. The Red Ajah does have women who hate men, but not all do. He went on to say that its a bad logical jump to say that just because a woman hates men means that she is a lesbian.

He then went on to say that he had a lesbian friend and they went out together looking for women and made a good team that way. (Erica, do you remember when this was? I have an idea that he meant over in Vietnam.)

#### Daniel Rouk

My impression is that RJ is not in the slightest bigoted about lesbians. He does have theories about female vs male roles in the army though, but that is a different topic.
