# [Interview #22, Entry #2]: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#2)

#### Daniel Rouk

The only net personality I knew was Erica. She took notes so will have much more info when she posts tonight. The bookstore was packed with probably about 100 people. I left just after my book was signed. This took about two hours to get to my number as many people had several copies of each of the series to sign. Nobody seemed to mind. There are LOTS of internet lurkers out there in the world though. Too bad more of them don't post, but the ones I talked to mentioned the volume as too heavy.
