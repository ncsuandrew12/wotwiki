# [Interview #22: LOC Signing Report - Daniel Rouk, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=22#13)

#### Robert Jordan

On why the combat scenes are not more involved: Because in combat things never really are clear. Also they are not really important.

Well, that's all I can really think of at the moment... I'm sure Erica will have some to say too, or more details on the above. I'll add more after tomorrow's signing at Oxford Books!

May the Wheel keep turning!
