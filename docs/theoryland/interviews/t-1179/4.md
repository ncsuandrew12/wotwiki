# [Interview #1179, Entry #4]: Borderlands SF-AU Tour](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#4)

#### Question

Is it possible to reliably deduce what a Shardworld's Cognitive realm will look like if we knew a lot about its Physical realm? For example, mists in Scadrial, spheres in Roshar etc.

#### Question

Yes, but it works in odd ways. So it may not work in the logical way that you think.
