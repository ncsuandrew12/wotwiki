#### Necarion

Is Taldain orbiting at a Lagrangian point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughs]

#### Necarion

It would make the orbits work

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Long pause] I’m not sure the implications, I have to think through implications before answering questions

#### Necarion

The situation I’m thinking of, it would orbit the big star but at the same period as the smaller star.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, well, I’ll just say ‘yes’, but I want to make sure I’m not saying ‘yes’, without...well, yes that’s how it has to work

#### Necarion

Right

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because [Taldain] I want to be not like Roshar where we have unstable orbits and things. Uh, but I… I’m saying yes, but I hope that doesn’t get me into trouble scientifically.

#### Footnote

[Necarion’s note 1: While the L1 Lagrange point is an equilibrium point in the three-body problem, it is technically an unstable one. However, this seems a system that could be corrected with a small input of Shardic intervention, far less than would be required by any other astronomical arrangement I can think of]
[Necarion’s note 2: Note the comment about ‘unstable orbits’ in the Rosharan system. This might account for the rapid variation in seasons on the planet]
