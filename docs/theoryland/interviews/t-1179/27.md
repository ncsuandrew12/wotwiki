# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#27)

#### Question

Now, do things actually move unpredictable at the edge [of a speed bubble] or do they refract out? Is it just that geometry is hard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I have a level of unpredictability, I mean we’re Chaos Theory. The idea being, you could predict if you had a perfect closed system and things like this, but it’s unfeasible for most technology and minds to be able to predict.
