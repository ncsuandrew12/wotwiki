#### Question

What about Hemalurgy in other worlds other than Mistborn?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. (I again asked with the exception of Kandra, have seen Hemalurgy such as people who may have been spiked. He repeated "You have seen Hemalurgy in other worlds." (In other words he is tight-lipped about Kandra part - neither yes or no)
