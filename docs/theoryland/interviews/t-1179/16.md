# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#16)

#### Question

I asked if Nazh's knife didn't glow to Kelsier's eyes because the metal wasn't from Scadrial generally or whether it was a metal with some particular property.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't even get to finish the second half of that before he got that smile and I knew what was coming next. Sure enough, I collected a shiny RAFO card.
