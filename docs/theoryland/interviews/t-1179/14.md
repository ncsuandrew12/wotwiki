# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#14)

#### Question

What would have happened if Kelsier hasn't taken Preservation or later Sazed hasn't taken Ruin and Preservation powers? Would the earth have been destroyed due to so much raw power much before the actual destruction due to Ruin's actions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. Bad things would have happened (Me - "Like Sel?" Him - "Not going to answer that. Just bad things would have happened")

#### Footnote

Scadrial, not Earth
