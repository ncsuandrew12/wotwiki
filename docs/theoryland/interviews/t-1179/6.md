#### Question

How do we pronounce Bavadin? Have we see his/her influence on other worlds till now â€“ like Austre in Nalthis or other religions which Sazed studied on Scadrial for example.

#### Brandon Sanderson

ba-va-din (ba as in batman, va as in want, din as in dinner). Yes you have seen her influence in other worlds other than Taldain. He wouldn't confirm if it is Nalthis or Scadrial or any other planet.
