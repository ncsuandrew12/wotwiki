# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#17)

#### Question

On the less serious side, I asked what Hoid's favorite flavor of instant noodles is.

#### Brandon Sanderson

At first I think he misheard me asking what his own favorite is ('spicy Korean ramen' apparently, though I don't remember the exact specifics) so I clarified. He said that Hoid is looking forward to instant noodles but they aren't Yolenese and he knows about them via the same method that he knows where he needs to be in the Cosmere.
