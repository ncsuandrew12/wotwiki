# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#22)

#### Necarion

Do Vessels have any flexibility in expressing the intent of a Shard, particularly if the Intent is open to many interpretations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes they do. So, the Vesselâ€™s mind and how they perceive is going to have a large influence on how things are expressed and I think all of them have some wiggle room. But there are some deterministic things that are also going to push them. You know, holding Ruin, Harmony may not go down the same path that happened to Ati.
