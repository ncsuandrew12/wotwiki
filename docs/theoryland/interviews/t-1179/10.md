# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#10)

#### Question

Do Ym, Stump belong to Edgedancer? Will we see Stump again in the future?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ym is not an Edgedancer. You will see Stump in the future novels though you may not see Tashikki much again.

#### Footnote

Peter Ahlstrom added this commentary in a facebook chat: "Both types of spren were initially considering Ym. I thought that was obvious. Add at the end: That's my interpretation of Wyndle's comments." This is in reference to Wyndle saying to Lift that he was considering bonding a cobbler who is nice to children.
