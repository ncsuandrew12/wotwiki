#### Question

Is there more significance to the 10 other planets around the Rosharian start system and them being gaseous? We know that Roshar's moons have unnatural orbits; so there seems to be some astronomical manipulation in the system.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes there is significance of 16 in cosmere and 10 in Rosharian system.
