# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#18)

#### Question

That gave me the opportunity to ask one last question, about feruchemical chromium and whether storing fortune would cause you to risk experiencing really improbable things, like the entropy curse in The Dresden Files.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said he wasn't going to answer questions about fortune, that the MAG shouldn't be taken as gospel on this point (I don't remember how it works there and didn't mention it, he brought it up on his own) and that he's planning something different than we might be thinking, for how that mechanic will function.
