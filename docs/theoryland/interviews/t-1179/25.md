# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#25)

#### Necarion

Would a Mistborn have to worry about accidentally burning her copper IUD?

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Footnote

[Necarion's note: this confirms that metal does not have to be in the stomach to be burned]
