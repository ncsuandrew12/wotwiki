#### Necarion

The compounding trick that the Lord Ruler performed. When you’re storing investiture, are you storing your ‘mistborn-ness’ or all the powers individually?

#### Brandon Sanderson

All of the powers individually.

#### Necarion

[Surprised, because this dashed a favorite theory of mine] Oh okay!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, the compounding trick. Really what’s happening is you’re fueling feruchemy with the power of allomancy, but you’re filtering it through you, and then you’re storing it.

#### Necarion

So it’s not that you’re a more powerful mistborn when you’ve tapped [investiture]

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, good question.
