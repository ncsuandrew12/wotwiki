#### Necarion

One other speed bubble question. Is the speed of light the same inside and outside a speed bubble?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, yes. The speed of light is the same. Good question, you’re trying to figure out the FTL.

#### Necarion

Also, it would eliminate the redshift if the speed of light…

#### Brandon Sanderson

If the speed of light were similar . That’s one thing we considered, but it felt too non-intuitive, plus it’s just not how I imagined things working. So, no it is not, but that’s a good question. It is something we considered.

#### Question

I just want to setup a lab in a speed bubble and do fun things.

#### Footnote

[Necarion’s note: there would be no redshift if the speed of light were directly proportional to the ‘speed of time’. Alas this theory doesn’t seem to be valid]
