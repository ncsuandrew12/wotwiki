# [Interview #1179: Borderlands SF-AU Tour, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#15)

#### Question

I asked if someone who had a lot of Breath would have it weaken collectively, in the same way that the single Breaths of children are more vibrant than others and move one slightly closer to a Heightening, then weaken as they grow older (and contribute slightly less towards a Heightening).

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that it wouldn't be noticeable once you accumulate enough Breath and, for example, Hoid wouldn't find himself suddenly losing perfect pitch as a function of time.
