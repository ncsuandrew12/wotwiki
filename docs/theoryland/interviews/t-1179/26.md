# [Interview #1179, Entry #26]: Borderlands SF-AU Tour](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1179#26)

#### Question

So my quick question: Can you use Identity (I love the speed bubbles!) to anchor speed bubbles to yourself?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh, this is possible. That’s less a matter of Identity. What’s gonna happen there, like, the more someone uses the powers, the more familiar and intermingled with their soul the powers become, and they are able to accomplish things that others can’t. This would be like a mistborn learning to hover a coin, right, which they can do, but most think you can’t. That’s the sort of level we’re going with.

#### Necarion

So a savant could?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A savant could totally do that. The problem is, things moving in and out of a speed bubble, there’s a transference of energy. This is how we keep speed bubbles from irradiating people when light moves through them, right, red shift. And so there’s a transfer of energy directly from the spiritual realm, which means that moving with a speed bubble, you’re gonna run into that, and it’s gonna be, it’s gonna cause all kinds of problems, but it would be possible.

#### Footnote

[Necarion’s note: This might be a very interesting method of harnessing energy, much more efficient than my earlier Terris Wheel idea]
