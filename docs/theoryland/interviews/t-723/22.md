*We also meet three other people who can travel between the worlds, two of whom we've met before (one in
*Elantris*
and one in Mistborn), who are apparently trying to track Hoid down.*

Brilliant, just brilliant.

This really makes me excited to meet Blunt from

Blunt is NOT from
*Dragonsteel*

Brandon later
[said](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1034#21)
