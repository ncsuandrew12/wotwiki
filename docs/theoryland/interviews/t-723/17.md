[Brandon Sanderson to Launch NW YA New Fantasy Series titled
*STEELHEART*

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks, all, for the good wishes on this.

I first started talking about
*Steelheart*
a number of years ago. (Five, maybe six?) It was one of the projects I'd been planning to do in 2007 when the Wheel of Time came along and kind of distracted me.

Unable to work on it for years, I instead did up a proposal and started shopping it in Hollywood. I got interest, but everyone said "We'd be more comfortable if the book were done." So, over the years, I slowly pieced together an outline in my spare time and did chapters when I could. (I think a reading I did of the prologue of this last year is floating around on-line somewhere.)

One of the problems with working on the Wheel of Time is that it's so time-consuming, I basically can't work on any other big project while writing it. I stay creative by changing to new ideas and new concepts whenever I start feeling burned out—I work on them for a short time, then get my groove back and turn to the larger project.

That's why you see all kinds of little projects popping out here and there from me. I can't do Stormlight 2 at the same time as WoT. Two big series are just too much to do at once; one would suffer. Yet, I still need artistic liberation now and then to try something new and refresh myself.

The two novellas I'm releasing this year (
*Legion*
,
*The Emperor's Soul*
) and the short Mistborn novel last year (
*Alloy of Law*
) are things that came out of these side deviations.
*Steelheart*
is another. Shouldn't affect Stormlight 2 very much. I always like to have one large project and a handful of smaller ones running at the same time.

It may seem like a lot to have on my plate, but if you add
*Alloy of Law*
,
*Steelheart*
, and the two novellas together they are combined around half the length of
*The Way of Kings*
. (And took about 1/10 the brain space...)

I don't want to make excuses for not doing Stormlight 2, but this might give a little insight as to why you keep seeing all of these other projects popping up.

Are any of these stories within the cosmere?

*The Emperor's Soul*
, a novella, is in the cosmere.
