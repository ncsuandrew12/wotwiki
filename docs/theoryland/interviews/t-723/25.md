Just finished
*The Way of Kings*
Stormlight Achives.

If you, like me read Mistborn and wanted more then do not hesitate to read this book. It is definitely slower, but this book is fast on so many other levels. I really wanted B Sanderson to immediately finish more Mistborn books. Now, I do not care if he eats, sleeps or spends time with his family. I am willing to sell my house and buy him a lifetime supply of Red Bull so that he can finish the rest of these books. Great books and stories. I wish that damned wax would hurry off 75%!

Whelp, guess I'd better get off of reddit and go back to writing again.
