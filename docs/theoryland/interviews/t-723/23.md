Correct me if I am wrong. But has Brandon not been planning sequels for
*Elantris*
and
*Warbreaker*
?

#### ERICMM76

BUt writing a sequel after the fact does not mean the first book is not Stand-Alone.

The question will be whether the 2nd book is as stand-alone as
*Warbreaker*
was, for instance.

#### SENAE

Totally true! That's why
*Fellowship of the Ring*
,
*Eye of the World*
,
*A Game of Thrones*
,
*A New Hope*
, and
*The Final Empire*
were all standalones!

(In less snarky terms,
*Elantris*
and
*Warbreaker*
may both be less obviously part of a series, but there's pretty obviously a ton of story hooks for potential sequels. Hell,
*Warbreaker*
ended with two characters going off on adventures! Brandon has said he's always planned on them being part of series.)

Brandon also adds story hooks even if he never plans on writing more. That's because books with no story hooks feel artificial to him. He wants to give a sense that the characters lived before the book started and will continue to live on (at least, those who don't get killed) after the book ends.
