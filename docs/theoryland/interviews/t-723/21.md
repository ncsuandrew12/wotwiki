I also love how you evolved the world for
*The Alloy of Law*
. Despite it not being as "heavy" as some other stuff like
*Way of Kings*
and the trilogy, it was almost my favorite things you've written. I know it was supposed to be a "bridge" novel between trilogies, but is there any chance we'll see those characters again? Wax and Wayne are probably my favorite literary pairing since Tehol and Bugg or Arthur and Ford. :)

I am working on a sequel, as I was fond of the book too. It will be a side project, however, so I can't promise when it would be out.
