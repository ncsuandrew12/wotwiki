Came for the ass kicking, left cause of ass kissing.

...You do realize that Brandon wrote this?

Sadly yes, I heard about him writing it last week, was extremely hype for it. And all for this, something that reads like mediocre fan-fiction. With great expectations comes great disappointment.

In that direction lay a trap.

I've stated before that I am uncomfortable with these cage matches because the pairings are often silly, and because I have trouble believing some of the characters would actually fight one another for any reason.

Because the nature of the whole things is so ridiculous to me, I couldn't possibly play it straight. And if I did, the effort required to make it work would distract me from other projects&madshand I would have to write both characters out of character to the point that it would just come off as lame.

And so, you get a silly conversation. That was really my only option here, I'm afraid.
