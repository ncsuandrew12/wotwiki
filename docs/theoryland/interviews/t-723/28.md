*As I write this, my novella
*Legion*
is being uploaded to the various ebook stores. It should now be for sale everywhere at $2.99.*

Except Europe where it's $5.74 on Kindle.

That's odd. It shouldn't be that expensive. We did the ebook ourselves, so maybe we got a wire crossed somewhere.

Just checked, and it's the right price at Amazon.co.uk. Amazon France and Amazon Germany have it at close to the right price. In which country is it showing up that expensive? I'll go get it fixed.

Even though you can set the prices individually for each country, I think the actual sale price is often more expensive in Europe. This is a
[2011 thread](http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle/Tx3UJ047O18XCU4?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG)
about it on the amazon forums. So I think there's nothing you can do about that.

One alternative: Smashwords is a good way to sell ebooks to people in other countries. Whenever someone from another country has a hard time buying my novel, I usually point them there.

If it's been going on since January 2011 as Moses says, and that does seem to be the case, then it looks like all we can do is tell people to buy elsewhere than Amazon.

All of the versions are DRM-free, so you can buy it elsewhere and then convert it for your Kindle. Or you can just buy it from Dragonmount; they include both mobi and epub, and you can put the mobi right on your Kindle.

I did email Amazon about it earlier today but we'll see if they say anything different.

I've seen people in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland report it as being $5.74, and someone in Mexico sees a $4.99 price. It's very annoying.
