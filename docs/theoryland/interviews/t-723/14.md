|Wax's earring is Invested. (Or, in other terms, it's a Hemalurgic spike.)

Doesn't that imply it was shoved through someone's heart at one point (ala Steel Inquisitor creation process)?

Yes, the metal would have to have been part of a spike that at one point was used to kill someone and rip off a piece of their soul.
