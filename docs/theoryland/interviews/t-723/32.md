Is
*The Emperor's Soul*
available as an ebook?

I know the paper copy is available from many retailers, but I've pretty much switched to reading books on my laptop or Kindle. Is there a way for me to buy a copy of
*The Emperor's Soul*
in a digital format?

Yup, Monday, I believe. The March date is for the UK publisher's ebook release. Until then, you'll be able to get it from me, and once they release theirs I will withdraw mine from the UK store and let them sell it.

Sorry it took a little extra time—we weren't expecting the print book to go live as soon as it did. Do note, however, that (like
*Legion*
) I will send you a free ebook if you buy the print edition.
