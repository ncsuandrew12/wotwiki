[My Dad's moving, so he let me pick through his book collection and choose some to take home with me. It's like Christmas in July.](http://imgur.com/a/XzvhG#0)

My Dad got me into reading fantasy and scifi when I was in Elementary School, but he wouldn't let me read many of these because of cough mature content cough (I'm looking at you,
*Wizard's First Rule*
&
*Stranger in a Strange Land*
). It was really, really cool to be able to go through his collection and pick up some older books in the genre that I had never even heard of.

List:

*Dune*
,
*Children of Dune*
, and
*Dune Messiah*
by Frank Herbert

*A Heinlein Trio*
by Robert A. Heinlein

*Sword*
,
*Elfstones*
,
*Elf Queen*
,
*Druid*
,
*Wishsong*
and
*Talismans of Shannara*
by Terry Brooks

*Kingdom of Summer*
by Gillian Bradshaw

*The Dragonstone*
by Dennis L. McKiernan

*The Dragonriders of Pern*
by Anne McCaffrey

*Wizard's First Rule*
by Terry Goodkind (I know, I know, the first book's not bad on its own though)

*The Lost Swords*
(The First and Second Triads) and
*The Complete Book of Swords*
by Fred Saberhagen

*The Once and Future King*
by T.H. White

*The Hollow Hills*
,
*The Crystal Cave*
, and
*The Last Enchantment*
by Mary Stewart

*Demons & Dreams (The Best Science Fiction and Horror)*
, edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling (This one has a short story by George R. R. Martin)

*Darkspell*
by Katharine Kerr

*Stranger in a Strange Land*
(uncut) by Robert A. Heinlein

*The Book of Lost Tales*
by J.R.R. Tolkien

*The Bardic Voices Trilogy*
by Mercedes Lackey

*The Bachman Books*
by Stephen King

and finally,

*Buck Rogers*
hardcover collection

I've only read about half of these. The covers on some of them are so deliciously 80s and 90s...

#### [Brandon Sanderson ()](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/vwfq8/my_dads_moving_so_he_let_me_pick_through_his_book/c58967h)

I haven't seen a number of those covers in a long, long time.

I'll second the Saberhagen, by the way. I really enjoyed those books. (And, of course, if you haven't read
*Dune*
or
*Dragonriders*
, they're both awesome.)
