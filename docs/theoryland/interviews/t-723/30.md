#### [Question (September 2012)](http://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/108gch/who_do_you_see_as_the_lead_in_the_legion_tv_show/?sort=old)

Who do you see as the lead in the
*Legion*
tv show?

Personally, I can see Hugh Laurie being brilliant in that role.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Fun fact: I usually don't 'cast' people in my books. They are who they are in my head, and that is not any actor in specific. However, for some reason, in writing
*Legion*
I didn't follow this. The aspects all naturally became either actors or people I know—perhaps because they are fabrications within a fabrication.

Anyway, the main three—Ivy, JC, and Tobias—are all based on famous actors. The other aspects are generally people I've met that I found interesting.
