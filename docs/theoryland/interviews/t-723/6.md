I'm going to write the dialogue and have a lot to do with the story. That's the only part I can really guarantee, but these guys are pretty awesome.

Also, I've seen early gameplay demos of Pushing and Pulling with Allomancy. It gave me chills.

Can you tell us what genre it's going to be (action, rpg, etc...) or is that confidential information?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/ranx7/mistborn_birthright_website_is_up/c44ov0d)

Action RPG.

Looking at LittleOrbit's web site, I think we shouldn't be expecting Skyrim here...

Little steps. I've pitched an open-world, Skyrim-like RPG (set in a new world I designed) to game developers before, but I don't have the video game experience to persuade them.

These guys are solid. The games they've done before were to stabilize the company, but guys on the Mistborn team worked on Fallout (the original ones) and others worked on Baldur's Gate.

Our goal is a third-person action RPG like Demons' Souls or The Force Unleashed with a heavier storytelling focus and a good system for Allomantic powers. If I can get the city to be somewhat open-world, like Infamous, I'd like to go that way—that may or may not be viable. We don't know for sure at this point.
