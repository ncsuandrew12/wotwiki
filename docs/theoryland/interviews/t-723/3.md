Does he have an AMA? I want to ask him if he accidentally writes a whole novel when he trips over furniture. Does he have a typewriter glued to each hand? How can anyone type that much? I should go do the math on average word written per minute to fire out that many books.

It looks a little more impressive than it is. A few things to consider:

I sold
*Elantris*
in 2003, but it wasn't scheduled to come out until 2005. Therefore, I had a three year period until
*Mistborn*
was scheduled (in 2006). I wrote the trilogy 2003-4-5, then wrote
*Warbreaker*
in 2006. In 2007, I wrote a book that I didn't believe was good enough, so scrapped it.

In 2007, the Wheel of Time was offered to me. I wrote book 12 in 2008, for a 2009 release. However,
*Warbreaker*
was still in the pipeline, and also scheduled for 2009.

2009 was the hard year, the one that makes me look super prolific. I wrote both WoT 13 and
*The Way of Kings*
. And really, the two were done over an 18 month period, stretching well into 2010.

2010 was, then, a recovery year. That's why
*Alloy of Law*
is my only full-length release this year, as it was written last year. This year I've written the final WoT book (and I'm not done yet...)

So, what you're seeing IS the result of a lot of hard work, but it looks far more impressive than it really is. The big reason for that is that I had a long running start, with several books in the pipeline.
