Ha. I saw this one the other day, and did a double take myself. For the record (if it needs to be said) I didn't write the review. I assume that a person can input whatever name they wish when writing reviews.

Who cares where it's posted, just buy the book and read it.

Just admit it. You're so proud of it, you decided to put your Brandon it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/n95w1/this_book_is_pretty_good/c37br6l)

Nice try, Brandon.
  
(...somebody was going to say it. Might as well get the sweet, sweet, karma myself.)

#### LAYINBRIX

Brandon has actually perfectly orchestrated this entire thread. They may appear to be separate accounts, with separate account ages, but it's all been designed to fit the marketing strategy. Now, you might need to ask yourself, am I Brandon too...? Or, more importantly, are YOU Brandon?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/n95w1/this_book_is_pretty_good/c37bu62)

Some people said to me, "Brandon, I know a man has to have goals, but you do realize how tough it will be to become ALL OF REDDIT, don't you?"

I replied that if I could not invent millions of fake accounts on a website and contrive fake conversations between them to give a semblance of life, what kind of writer would I be?

#### [Honor\_Bound](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/n95w1/this_book_is_pretty_good/c37b0xg)

Then... That would mean that you, Brandon, are concerned about a conspiracy that you started... And that I, also Brandon, am replying to you (me) about my(your) conspiracy that we are all me.

Coincidence? We'll let

decide.

"And on that fateful night, the 'Nice try, Brandon' meme was born."

#### [JA50N](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/n95w1/this_book_is_pretty_good/c37b92j)

And on the morrow, "Nice try, Brandon" was buried in concrete, weighed with heavy things, and thrown in the depths of the ocean, never to be heard from again.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/n95w1/this_book_is_pretty_good/c37bv9k)

Please, gods of reddit, let it be so. A good meme must be given freedom to die—not forced on in a cruel mockery of life, like the lifeless horrors of Chuck Testa's lab.
