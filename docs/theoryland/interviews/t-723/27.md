Great effort from Brandon!

Hey all,

I just wanted to share with you this mail I got from Subterranean Press, through which Brandon sells his new book Legion.

[Here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/PR5ZI.png)

I think this is a great development, and I hope this experiment succeeds. Keep up the good work, Brandon!

That is fantastic. Brandon appears to be approaching the ebook market in a really wonderful way, embracing it, and delivering intuitively. Now that I have an ereader, I don't buy physical books as much, but I love having the actual paper copy, too.

~~I wonder if this is for anyone who buys it hereon out, as well? The website doesn't seem to have those details available.~~

I will happily purchase the paper copy of books if an ebook comes along with it. Does anyone know which version, the paper vs. electronic, gives more to the author? Ultimately, I want to pay my dues here! Brandon is a really great author, and I'd love to support him as best I can. (Would it be weird to check out a copy from the library, then paypal/mail Brandon the retail price of the book? He's an exception- I wouldn't do that for every author!)

Anyway, I love ebooks and this is a great step towards helping and forwarding the market. Kudos Brandon, thank you for all you do, and for furthering this cause.

The offer will last the life of the book.

In this case, I make about the same from either copy, so don't worry about that. Do remember that this is a novella, however, so either think of it as a very long short story or a very, very short novel. At $20, that length can be a bit pricy for some wallets, which is one reason for the $2.99 ebook.

If you ever read my books from the library, don't feel bad about me money wise. I love libraries, and your interest in my books there makes them order in more copies. If you want to give something back to me in that case, just loan one of my books that you own to someone else and get them to read it. That can do wonders for an author.

Just a heads-up: you may want to have the folks at Dragonmount.com work on their SEO a bit. The page to purchase the ebook version of
*Legion*
doesn't come in the first page of search results for "Sanderson Legion ebook."

#### Brandon Sanderson

Ha. Okay, I'll give them a heads up. Thanks. :)
