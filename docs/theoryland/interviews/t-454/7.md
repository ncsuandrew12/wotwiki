About the Upcoming Epic Magic Battle Between Brandon and Jason Denzel:

#### Brandon Sanderson

See, I’m expecting...the reason why I’m doing it like I’m doing it. I’m giving myself a handicap. I’m not going to draw back into my stock of super cards like I could do. I’m only going to use the cards I’ve been given. It’s the natural, smaller pool. I’m expecting him to go and build the uber-super-deck. He can reach to any cards he wants and build the perfect deck...he’s going to need the fans to tell him what to make and then to make it...I don’t feel sorry for Jason at all. He’s going to come at me with some uber-deck perfected by fans at tournaments...oh he’s good at getting sympathy, but I’m going to expose him for what he is...
