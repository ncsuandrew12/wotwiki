#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon summarizes why the next book will be a bit more chaotic than
*The Gathering Storm*
, which may make
*Towers of Midnight*
a longer book.
*The Gathering Storm*
feels focused, whereas the
*Towers of Midnight*
may not feel that way.

Brandon discusses Mistborn questions.

Brandon mentioned that Peter knows the secret.
