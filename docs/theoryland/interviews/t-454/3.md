# [Interview #454: BYU Stormleader Dinner - Matt Hatch, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=454#3)

#### Matt Hatch

Did Robert Jordan leave a power to time comparison, as to how much time is burned back on a thread using balefire. Is there a calculation that says x amount of power will burn back x amount of time on a thread?

#### Brandon Sanderson

M.A.F.O—Maria and Find Out. What he did leave, he left a lot of stuff, there is discussion of these things in the notes. I need to look and see if there is an actual equation. He was very focused on strength of the Power and things like that. He has probably told you before, I think I’ve seen a copy of that on notes and things. He did leave scales on exactly how powerful each person is...

#### [MARIA SIMONS (VIA LUCKERS)](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/46013-mafo-answers/)

RAFO. Sorry, but we are doing an encyclopedia, and I have to reserve some things in case we want to put them in there.

#### Footnote

This is answered in more detail below, at entry #5.
