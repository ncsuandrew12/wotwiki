# [Interview #804: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Final 2012 Creative Writing Lecture + Updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=804#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Two more Writing Excuses podcast episodes are up. The first covers what we call
[the problem of originality](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/07/02/)
: Is it possible to be too original? Do we overvalue originality? Then the second episode is another one of our "project in depth" episodes; this time we cover Mary Robinette Kowal's latest novel,
[Glamour in Glass.](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/07/08/)
(Earlier we did the same thing with my novel
[The Way of Kings](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/06/10/)
and Howard's graphic novel volume
[Force Multiplication](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/05/20/)
.)
