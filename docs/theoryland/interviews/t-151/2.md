# [Interview #151: COT Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=151#2)

#### Robert Jordan

[inaudible] Well, I don’t know what I’m supposed to say, so I think I will start off by giving you some pronunciations.

#### Audience

[LAUGHS, CHEERS]

#### Robert Jordan

[inaudible] ...use pronunciations that I’m not quite sure where they came from. It’s Nynaeve Al’Meara and Siuan Sanche. Aiel, Aiel, not ale. Ale is a drink. Egwene al’Vere. That seems to be a fairly obvious one to me, but...it’s one I labored over the most, because I knew exactly how I wanted it to sound. I used [inaudible] in the first draft spelled, 14 different spellings of her name...I thought it was obvious to even the most casual observer [slightly inaudible, but same phrase as he’s used with Asmodean] everyone will see this and know exactly how to pronounce this name...but I was wrong. [More like this] Mazrim Taim, Moridin, Moghedien, Semirhage (don’t forget her. If you forget her, she gets very upset), Ba’alzamon.

#### Audience

Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

(The pronunciation of) Asmodean is quite correct.

#### Audience

Who killed him? [LAUGHS]

#### Robert Jordan

I no longer have to worry about that, because someone has actually deduced who killed him, using the evidence that was available two books ago, perhaps three books ago. And I’d said that that evidence should have been sufficient to tell us who killed Asmodean and so someone has posted it.

#### Audience

Where?

#### Robert Jordan

It’s out there. The evidence is there. [inaudible. Apparently, an audience member asked, “Was it Bela?”] Bela has an alibi. A shaky alibi, yeah. OK, I will take just a few questions, because then we’re gonna have to get all of you guys to here (point to table), to sign your books.
