#### Question

The question is, with Rand and Lews Therin, do they have one soul or two souls in the body?

#### Robert Jordan

They have one soul with two personalities. The reincarnation of souls does not mean reincarnation of personalities. The personality develops with each reincarnation of the soul. This is the cosmology that I have cobbled together.
