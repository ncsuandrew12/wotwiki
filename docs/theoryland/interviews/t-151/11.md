# [Interview #151: COT Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=151#11)

#### David Funke

When RJ signed my copies of
*Winter's Heart*
and
*Crossroads of Twilight*
, I asked him a question. Because of wording he uses when describing the Finn and their meeting with Mat, I thought that maybe Min’s viewings had some relation to them. RJ describes the Finn as looking, not at Mat, but at the air around Mat’s head. I thought this was similar to the way Min sees her viewings. Are they related, I asked him?

#### Robert Jordan

No, he said flatly.

#### David Funke

Shucks, I said to his assistant. I was so sure!
