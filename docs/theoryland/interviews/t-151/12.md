# [Interview #151: COT Signing Report - David Funke, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=151#12)

#### David Funke

Then I wished him a pleasant book-signing tour, and he thanked me for it. RJ, if you read this, thank YOU! A note to all: At this particular signing, we were limited: He’d only sign two hardcover books per person, and no softcovers. He DID sign my friend’s hardcover copy of the Illustrated Guide, though.

I did this because over the past few weeks, I've been visiting Dragonmount almost daily. Also, I've examined a good portion of the WoTFAQ. I wanted to give something back to community, even something as small as this. I hope everyone enjoys this! And Thanks. You do a great job with Dragonmount.com.
