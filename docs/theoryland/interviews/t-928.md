## [Entry #1](./t-928/1)

#### crovax33

I asked Sanderson if we'll ever find out how Rand lit the pipe in the epilogue.

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

He said that nowhere in Jordan's notes did it say how the pipe was lit, but that Harriet had a couple of theories, the main one being: with it being a new Age, there's a new way of doing things, and even some new magic.

## [Entry #2](./t-928/2)

#### crovax33

I also asked about Nakomi, and he confirmed that he has been sworn to secrecy on her identity. That's all the detail I was able to get out of him before being moved ahead in line.
