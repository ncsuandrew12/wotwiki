# [Interview #99: TPOD Signing Report - Scott Cantor, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=99#2)

#### Scott Cantor

When I reached the signing table, I asked him if he had a better idea now how many novels there would be than he might have had previously, knowing it was a lame question, but he answered it politely.

#### Robert Jordan

He said he knew there would be at least three more, and that he generally finds himself with twice as much planned for a novel as he can pull off in 700 pages, which happened with the new one. This suggested to me that 5-6 more books would not be surprising.
