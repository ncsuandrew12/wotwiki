# [Interview #821: COT Signing Report - Dave Rothgery, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=821#2)

#### Dave Rothgery

If I go to another signing, I'm showing up early, with a hundred copies of transcripts from the most recent online chat, and handing them out. There were all of two questions asked that weren't reruns, and one was basically a RAFO, while the other was mine.

#### Robert Jordan

My looney theory on the Ways was wrongâ€”despite a 2500 year lag before anything noticeable happened, the darkening was really a taint side effect.
