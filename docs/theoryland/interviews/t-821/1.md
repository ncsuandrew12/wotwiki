# [Interview #821, Entry #1]: COT Signing Report - Dave Rothgery](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=821#1)

#### Dave Rothgery

I think that's dropped into his stock answers; he certainly said something similar at the San Diego signing last week. When a non-rasfwrj-ian friend who I ran into at the signing asked me about that, my response was that since every character who could plausibly have done it (and some who are quite implausible) has been proposed by hundreds of different people, of course someone's figured it out correctly by now.

#### Footnote

This comment was made about RJ's statement at numerous signings that someone 'on the internet' had figured out who killed Asmodean.
