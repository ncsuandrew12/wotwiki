What exactly is a dueling cane anyhow?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136150651527892992)

Depends. Some are flexible, like sparring swords, and are used for duels where blood is not needed.

Others are basically a big length of wood for hitting people, like a tonfa without the grip.

#### ERICPETERS

Do canes have a hilt like a sparring sword then? I always picture something like

being used

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Many have a hilt. However for most, there is no crossguard or the like.

And most don't taper like that one. They are often of a uniform diameter all the way down.
