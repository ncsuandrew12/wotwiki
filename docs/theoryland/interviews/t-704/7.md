What is your favorite book you've written?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136145655604322304)

Favorite is hard to pin down. I'm most proud of either
*The Gathering Storm*
or
*The Way of Kings*
, as they were among the hardest and most satisfying.
