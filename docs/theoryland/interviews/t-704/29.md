How does your approach differ in writing science fiction and then fantasy? Both stylistically and conceptually.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136154710498480128)

For SF I take many more things for granted, meaning I focus more on story and less on worldbuilding.

In SF, I will also generally focus on a handful of ideas instead of a whole ton of them.

This usually makes my sf shorter than my fantasy.
