Did you ever study a martial art yourself? Did studying a foreign language change the way you write?

My only martial arts study comes from reading and watching, with the occasional 'one shot' go learn some basics.

Studying a foreign language was extremely helpful in opening my eyes to other cultures, and my own language.
