Do you have a trick for plowing through writer's block?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 November 2011)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/136146973744054273)

Yes. I just write anyway, telling myself I don't have to use what I write. I write it poorly, then try again.

For me, that gets my brain working. You can't be afraid to 'throw away' what you've done for a day and try again.

With that in mind, you can have the most random of things happen, knowing you won't keep them. Just to get jump-started.
