Any suggestions for finding time to write for a full time dad with a full time non-writing job?

It depends on whether or not your day job is creatively draining. If it is writing/programming, etc (more)

You'll have a much harder time, as those jobs flex the same muscles as novel writing.

The people I've known who do it tend to get up an hour early, before their brain is worn out, and write then.

Basically, you'll have to give something up. Television, video games, golf, something. (But not family time.)
