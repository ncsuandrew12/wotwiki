how old were you when you first started writing? any advice for young writers, given economy at the moment?

I started at age 15 or 16, but didn't finish a novel until in my 20s. As for new writers, don't worry about the money.

It will probably take a few years to get published, or to be making money, so focus on the craft first.

Think of becoming a writer like becoming a doctor. It can take 6-8 yrs. Who knows what the economy will be like?
