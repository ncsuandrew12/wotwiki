Hello Fellow Sharders!
So today, Brandon answered several questions on twitter.com during a #torchat, and there are quite a few interesting questions. When I orignially saw it, I panicked a bit,but thankfully the Inseperable Peter Ahlstrom came to the rescue and posted Brandon's tweets for the past two weeks today. Thanks Peter!

#### Footnote

Only the Cosmere and Brandon questions are on here. The WoT questions are in the Twitter WoT 2011 thread.
