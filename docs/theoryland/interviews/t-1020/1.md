2013 has been one helluva year for Brandon Sandersonâ€”he recently took home his first two Hugo Awards (for the novella
*The Emperor's Soul*
and the podcast Writing Excuses) and he released his first young adult work
*The Rithmatist*
to critical acclaimâ€”but it's about to get exponentially better.

Reading Sanderson's latest release, a blockbuster of a thriller entitled
*Steelheart*
(out September 24), will have fans of superhero fantasy feeling like they've stumbled into their own Herbal Essences commercial ("Yes, yes, yes!"). It's a mind-blowing experienceâ€”easily one of the most satisfying novels I've read all year.

Set in a near future where the appearance of a bright red star in the sky (known as Calamity) has given some ordinary people extraordinary powers, this novelâ€”which is the first installment of his Reckoners seriesâ€”is nothing short of a masterwork.

The story is kick assâ€”it's breakneck paced and action packed. Subtle foreshadowing and allegory abound. The chapters are relatively short and all end with cliffhangers. As the story progresses, Sanderson begins revealing jaw-dropping plot twists. Everything comes together in a climax that will have readers not only standing up and applauding but instantly agonizing because they now have to wait a year until the next novel (
*Firefight*
) is released.

Bottom line:
*Steelheart*
is an absolute must-read for anyone who is a fan of superhero fiction. And while it's marketed as a young adult read (ages 12 and up), it's not really so much a young adult novel as a novel that can be read and enjoyed by young adults.

The following exclusive interview with Sanderson is transcribed from audio that he recorded specifically for the Barnes & Noble Blog.
