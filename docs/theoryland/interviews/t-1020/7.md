# [Interview #1020: The Great Salty One: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1020#7)

#### Paul Goat Allen

Will this series be a trilogy or is it open-ended at this point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A trilogy, but I can't tell you if it's open-ended, Paul! I can't reveal the ending of the third book, or anything about it, while the first book is just barely out! So, you'll have to wait and see.

#### Paul Goat Allen

That response was pure evil, Great Salty One. Pure evil...
