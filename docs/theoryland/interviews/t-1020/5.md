#### Paul Goat Allen

I couldn't help but imagine
*Steelheart*
being made into an amazing movie as I was reading it. There were so many visually and thematically stunning sequences: the Steelheart/Deathpoint conflict, the Reckoners' attempt to murder Conflux, the death of Nightwielder, the battle in Soldier Field, etc. This could be one of the coolest superhero movies ever made. Any thoughts on a
*Steelheart*
movie?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think a
*Steelheart*
movie would be awesome. Ever since I wrote the prologueâ€”which was the first thing I wrote for thisâ€”I've visualized it as a movie. I've tried very hard to get it made, but I have no power in Hollywood, so if your uncle's Joss Whedon, have him call me.

I feel the best film adaptations are those that are more strongly adapted. I love when filmmakers are respectful of the source material, but when they try to stick too closely to it, I feel that the films aren't as good. I would love to be involved in making a film, but not having practiced the screenwriting skillset as much as I have novel writing, my instincts are to find people I trust to make a good film and allow them to use their talents to adapt the novel.
