# [Interview #1020, Entry #2]: The Great Salty One: An Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1020#2)

#### Paul Goat Allen

Brandon, first off, congratulations on the Hugo wins! Has it all sunken in yet? And how do you think these Hugo Awards will affect your writing going forward?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you very much! I don't know if winning the Hugo has sunk in yet. Writing something worthy of winning the Hugo has been a lifelong goal of mine. I don't know if it will change me other than the fact that there will be a whole lot less pressure to future Hugo Awards ceremonies for me. Being able to do it once is kind of a proof of concept to me, if that makes any sense. I feel really satisfied.
