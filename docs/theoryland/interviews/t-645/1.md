BTW, did Sydo Zandstra (spelling?) show up at any of the signings? We met him at the LVDFS a couple of years ago.

#### SYDO ZANDSTRA

How nice to be remembered... \*grin\*, hi Pat! Yes, I managed to be present at one of the sessions at the Fantasy Fair (on Saturday), although I must say I actually went there to see and hear Terry Pratchett. RJ's presence being a welcome bonus to me, I let him sign four of my hardcovers and asked him a couple of questions. Most of those have already been covered by the original poster, but one of them might be of some interest to some people here, so I might as well throw it in right now. (I wanted to post this earlier, but somehow it has slipped my mind)
