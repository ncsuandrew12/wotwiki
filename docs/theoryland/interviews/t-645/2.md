# [Interview #645: Elf Fantasy Fair - Sydo Zandstra, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=645#2)

#### Sydo Zandstra

In one or two threads I have been wondering for a while why Erian Boroleos (Green) wasn't assigned to one of the circles that were defending Rand while he and Nynaeve were cleansing
*saidin*
. (See Pam's
*Winter's Heart*
notes for the details; IIRC it has been placed under the header 'possible screw-ups') So I asked RJ when I had the chance:

Me: "Could you tell me if Erian was present in the battle near Shadar Logoth, when Rand was cleansing
*saidin*
?"

#### Robert Jordan

[looking up] Who?

#### SYDO ZANDSTRA

Erian, one of the captured Green sisters who swore fealty to Rand. Did she take part in the battle, or was she somewhere else?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Oh. Yes, she was there. RAFO.

#### SYDO ZANDSTRA

This could either mean that Erian did something special that we don't know about, or that RJ forgot about her while writing the last chapters. On the other hand, possibly RJ thought I meant Elsa (who was definitely there). Perhaps Erian wasn't there but went to Tear with Alanna instead. I guess we'll find out in a year or so...
