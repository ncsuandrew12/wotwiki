A tale of two signings: part one

OK folks, here's my report on the NYC area signings. I was planning on only going to the City signing, but I got so little info there I decided to schlepp out to Huntington for the 8:00 signing as well.

First the NYC signing.

#### NaClH2O

Deadsy had sent me a
[Question of the Week](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=4#8)
that she had asked, the one about the configuration of the roof of the White Tower. The Barnes & Noble (or Tor I'm not sure which) clone said that it was against the rules to have this signed. I protested a bit and she called in a higher level clone.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ was listening to all this and said, "It's okay, I'd be happy to sign it. I'll sign anything as long as it's not certain male body parts." So I got it signed. And gave him the CD Deadsy had sent as well. He mentioned that bribes did not work and Deadsy would still not know the answer to "Boxers or Briefs". He seemed to be in a very jocular mood.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=27#3)

#### NaClH2O

As he was signing I asked, "Who arranged for the stabbing of Demira Sedai?"

#### Robert Jordan

I got a RAFO. He started to say something, and then said, "No I better not...it's a RAFO."

#### NaClH2O

I was then hustled out of the way by another Barnes & Noble/Tor clone. End of NYC signing. One question asked one RAFO gotten. I felt kinda cheated.
