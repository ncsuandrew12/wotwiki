#### billiam

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

While getting my books signed I asked Brandon how many books he had written before
*Elantris*
and he said seven, not all of which were epic fantasy. He also said that that number had risen to thirteen books by the time
*Elantris*
was published, making
*Mistborn*
the fourteenth book he had written.
