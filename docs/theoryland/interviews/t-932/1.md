Just got back from the Seattle signing. First off, I want to say that Brandon is really super cool; just a nice, personable guy. First and foremost the guy is just a fan.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He even said that the best part of being done with writing WoT is that he can go back to being a fan; discussing and theorizing with others, something he felt he couldn't do while still writing the books. He said that he can finally start talking to other people about the end of the series.
