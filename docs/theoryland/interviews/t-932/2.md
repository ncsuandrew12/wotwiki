# [Interview #932: AMOL Signing Report - billiam, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=932#2)

The best part of the night? My nine year old daughter got to fist bump Brandon when we got to the signing table. How cool is that?

The event went pretty much the same as the others described earlier, with pretty much the same questions being asked. Harriet was also there and read the "Wind" paragragh after the Q & A period.

I got to meet and talk with both Wetlandernw (who was dressed like Cadsuane, natch) and JeffS (who gave my daughter a "Bela is a darkfriend" bumpersticker for being there) who were both MKs.
