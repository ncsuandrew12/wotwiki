# [Interview #661: East of the Sun Con - Brandoch Daha, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=661#3)

#### Brandoch Daha

Another question I asked was why men and women keep talking past each other in the books.

#### Robert Jordan

His answer to that question was that that's how it really is. Men and women think too differently to really understand each other; that's a biological impossibility. His books simply reflect this fact.

#### BRANDOCH DAHA

However, I never asked why the main characters all have a mental age of thirteen. But as I said, a sympathetic Southern gentleman he is. (Though his wife was even nicer.)
