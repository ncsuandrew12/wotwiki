# [Interview #661: East of the Sun Con - Brandoch Daha, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=661#2)

#### Brandoch Daha

In 1995, I helped arrange a fantasy convention in Stockholm, "East of the Sun," and one of our author guests of honor was Robert Jordan. A very nice man, I might add. In my interview with him, I asked why he wrote so much (at the time, only the first six books had been published, nota bene).

#### Robert Jordan

His response was interesting and enlightening. You need many words to fully tell a story, was his answer, plain and simple. There's only one reason why authors
*don't*
write five, six, and ten book series: They are lazy. A good story is long, complete, and omits nothing.

#### BRANDOCH DAHA

In other words, Robert Jordan has absolutely no clue what a good literary text looks like.
