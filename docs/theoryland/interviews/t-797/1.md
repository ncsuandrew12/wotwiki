# [Interview #797, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Class Lecture on Characterization + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=797#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right now I'm in Las Vegas for this year's edition of the
[Superstars Writing Seminar](http://www.superstarswritingseminars.com/)
where I'm an instructor. I posted about this several times over the last few months, so I hope it's not a surprise to anyone!

[Hal-Con](http://hal-con.com/)
in Halifax, Nova Scotia has been added to my
[events calendar](http://brandonsanderson.com/events)
for October this year. I'm looking forward to meeting lots of Canadian readers! That should be my final convention for 2012, and then will come the book tour in January, which is in the planning stages. For my current schedule as it stands, see the previous link.
