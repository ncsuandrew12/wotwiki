#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
annotation covers one of my favorite chapters, number
[eleven](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/455/Alcatraz-Chapter-Eleven)
. It's the one where Alcatraz talks about how authors like to torture people. But that's not what makes it one of my favorites.
