# [Interview #172: COT Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#2)

#### John Nowacki

I asked a couple of questions, one of them from
[Zeynep's list](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=171)
. How much time elapsed between the last chapter of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
and the epilogue?

#### Robert Jordan

He thought for a second before giving an RAFO and adding it was not that much, certainly not months.
