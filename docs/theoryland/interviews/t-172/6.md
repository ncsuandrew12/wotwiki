# [Interview #172: COT Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#6)

#### Robert Jordan

Someone else said something about his health and got a lengthy recitation of Jordan's blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and so on.

#### John Nowacki

I didn't stay for the whole thing but caught most of it. I may be at tonight's signing in Bailey's Crossroads (someone who's out of town asked me to take her books in and I didn't have time get them all signed this afternoon), and if so, I'll post something about it later this evening.
