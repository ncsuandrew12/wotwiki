# [Interview #172: COT Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=172#1)

#### John Nowacki

Regarding this afternoon's signing at Olsson's in D.C.: Not much to report.

#### Robert Jordan

He started off with the usual intro about pronunciations, picture taking, the last scene, and so on. Repeated that Olver isn't Gaidal Cain and what's already been mentioned here about someone figuring out who killed Asmodean using material from "up through
*Winter's Heart*
. . . I think." Also the bit about enjoying watching some of us try to figure it out.
