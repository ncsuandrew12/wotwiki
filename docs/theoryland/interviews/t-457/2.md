# [Interview #457: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Updates, Signed Hardbacks, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=457#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

You also may have noticed that I've put up a new item in the storeâ€”a holiday bundle of all three Mistborn hardbacks (signed) at a special price with the popular Steel Alphabet Medallion thrown in. And a note on shipping for the holiday season: to make sure a package arrives by December 24th, December 7th is the last day my assistant Becky can take orders with standard shipping. Orders upgraded to Priority shipping can be made as late as December 12th (the Mistborn bundle gets a free upgrade).
