Right now, taking a (short) break from the WoT rewrite to spend an evening working on the Mistborn video game script.

XBox? PC?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159888847088521216)

Both.

I don't suppose you can tell us who's developing it yet, can you?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159889167378165760)

Afraid I'm not allowed to say yet.

#### [Abel Silva](http://twitter.com/abelsilva/status/159889667683127296)

Is Epic games developing? Is this how they got you to write the Infinity Blade novella?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159890360691208192)

I hope to do some projects with Epic in the future, but they are not doing this one.

Part of why I took that project, however, was to get more experience with video game storytelling and plotting.

Really looking forward to Mistborn game will it be xbox, do you get to be Kel?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160186601924853761)

It's set hundreds of years before the first book.
