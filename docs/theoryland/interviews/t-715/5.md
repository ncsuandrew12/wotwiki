Subterranean Press has announced preorder availability of my new novella "Legion," coming sometime in the summer/fall.

Did you know there's a Marvel Comics character called Legion who has abilities very similair to those found in your novella?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/165392919543554049)

Someone mentioned it to me yesterday. I'm afraid, though, it's impossible not to do things that Marve/DC haven't covered.

Magneto vs Allomancy, for example, or about a billion gravity manipulation superheroes vs Szeth.

When I write something, I can't ask "Has anyone done this before?" because the answer will ALWAYS be yes.

:) That said, it's amusing (but perhaps not surprising) that we both used the same idea with the name.

Have you ever felt the need to change anything in your writing that was TOO close to something already out there?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/165456650789072899)

Yes, I have—but only in the pre-publication stage. If I'd known about the Marvel character, for example

I probably would have used another name. Still, knowing now means I can change it if I do a full novel.
