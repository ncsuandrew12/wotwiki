# [Interview #58: East of the Sun Interview - Helena Lofgren, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=58#7)

#### Robert Jordan

On our FAQ, he stated that 30-35% is fully correct, 30-35% is close, but not quite correct, and the rest is "way off in the left field". He though saw it more as a conclusive document than a synopsis of earlier discussions.

He also noted that some things we have rooted out he thought he had hidden immensely deep in the books, and we still managed to deduce the right "answers", while some things he saw as fully clear we had missed entirely or were totally clueless on.
