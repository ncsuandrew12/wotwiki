#### Karl-Johan Norén

Robert Jordan Interview—Made at the East of the Sun fantasy convention, Stockholm, 17 June 1995 by Helena Löfgren.

Summary written by Karl-Johan Norén.

All errors are made by me, and no one else, especially not Robert Jordan. I can't guarantee any quotes, since I didn't have a recorder, but just took notes.
