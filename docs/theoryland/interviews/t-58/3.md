# [Interview #58: East of the Sun Interview - Helena Lofgren, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=58#3)

#### Robert Jordan

The story of TWoT evolved during a very long period, in part beginning in the middle of the seventies with the idea of the Breaking of the World, before he found the "final scene in the final book" and began to actually write
*The Eye of the World*
. The main impetus from the beginning was the notion of "
*men*
breaking the world" (my emphasis), and that men able to channel must be killed, controlled or stopped at all costs for 3,000 years. This led naturally to a society where women had great power and respect.

As an example of this, he puts forth Davram Bashere's reaction to Faile being a Hunter of the Horn. His initial negative response does not come from that Faile is a girl, but that she only is 17 years old. Her gender is irrelevant to the issue.
