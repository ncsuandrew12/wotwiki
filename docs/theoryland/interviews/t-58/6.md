# [Interview #58: East of the Sun Interview - Helena Lofgren, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=58#6)

#### Robert Jordan

With the final scene in the final book (which he eloquently said did not have to be identical with Tarmon Gai'don), all
*major*
plot lines will be resolved, and most minor ones. Some minor plot lines would still be unresolved, as a way to let the world continue to live and breathe. The surviving characters would still have lives to go on with, even if more "boring" ones. Robert Jordan though stated clearly that
*if*
he was going to write another book(s) in the WoT universe (something he thought was not going to happen), it would be placed at least 1,000 years apart from the events in the current books. There would
*not*
be any spin-off stories, or stories written by other authors set in the WoT universe, either.
