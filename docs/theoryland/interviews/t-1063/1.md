When word of a new fantasy book by Brandon Sanderson reaches the forests, the trees tremble. They know that sacrifices will have to be made by many of their sylvan sisters to provide enough paper to print his vision of another world.

The
*New York Times*
best-selling author, and Utah resident, started his epic fantasy series The Stormlight Archive in 2010 with the 1,007-page
[*The Way of Kings*](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700060795/Fantasy-writer-Brandon-Sanderson-has-had-quite-a-year.html?pg=all)
, a book that
*Publishers Weekly*
called "massive" and
*Booklist*
called "colossal."

Now in the wake of his Hugo Award-winning novella,
[*The Emperor's Soul*](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865569956/Book-review-The-Emperors-Soul-is-thought-provoking.html?pg=all)
, and the successes of his short novels
[*Steelheart*](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865586783/Brandon-Sandersons-young-adult-novel-Steelheart-delivers-epic-action.html?pg=all)
and
[*The Rithmatist*](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865580623/Brandon-Sandersons-debut-young-adult-novel-is-a-successful-break-into-the-genre.html?pg=all)
, Sanderson is poised to slay more trembling trees with the second offering in The Stormlight Archive series, titled
*Words of Radiance*
(Tor Books, $28.99), a 1,087-page book.
