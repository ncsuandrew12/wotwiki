# [Interview #1063: Words of wonder: Brandon Sanderson seeks, delivers 'something big' in epic fantasy, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1063#2)

#### Michael De Groote

The two Stormlight books together weigh almost 6 pounds and take up 5 inches on a bookshelf. That's wider than two full collections of Shakespeare and about the same width as
*The Complete Calvin and Hobbes*
.

With eight more books planned for the series, Sanderson is just getting started.

#### Brandon Sanderson

"What I love about the epic fantasy genre is the chance to do something bigâ€”lots of characters across a long time," Sanderson said recently in an interview at
[Weller Book Works at Trolley Square in Salt Lake City](http://www.wellerbookworks.com/)
. "The scope you can cover in a book like this, in a series like this, is fun for me to deal with. You can really dig into characters and show them changing over a large period of time."
