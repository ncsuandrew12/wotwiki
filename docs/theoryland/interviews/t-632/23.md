# [Interview #632: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#23)

#### Wetlandernw

Last thingâ€”BWS gave the name of the second shard on Sel to someone at the signing tonight, but I can't tell you what it is; it's his to reveal in his own way. When I know he's posted it for all the world, I'll add it here.
