#### Brandon Sanderson

Upcoming book plans:
*A Memory of Light*
is first, of course; he expects to follow that with Book 2 of the Stormlight Archive in March or April 2013. Book 2 will have Shallan as the focus character (like Kaladin was in book 1), followed in subsequent books by Szeth, Navani and Dalinar. Once the first 5 Stormlight books are out, he plans to do the second Mistborn trilogy, then books 6-10 of Stormlight. Interspersed with the first 5 Stormlight books, he'll do several more Wax and Wayne books; similar to
*Alloy of Law*
, they'll be shorter, lighter, more witty & adventurous than the epics.

*Warbreaker*
2 will be another "in between" book; he plans to use the same process as the first
*Warbreaker*
, posting sections on his website and getting feedback, using a very open and interactive process of development.
