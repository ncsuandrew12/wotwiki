# [Interview #632: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#5)

#### Wetlandernw

Is there a distinction between the "bubbles of evil" and the "Pattern unraveling" events?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a distinction, in that they are different manifestations of the same root cause: the bubbles come from the Dark One's prison and slide along the threads of the Pattern until they pop, while the Pattern unraveling is a result of balefire as well as the Dark One's direct influence. The "torn lace" icon is used for both.
