# [Interview #632: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#1)

#### Wetlandernw

Why do the Twinborn in
*Alloy of Law*
have only one feruchemical power, when all previous feruchemists, in spite of breeding programs, could use all the metals? (from travyl) Or were Ferrings always part of the system and we just didn't meet them in Mistborn? (my addition)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Ferrings are a new development since Mistborn, as the Feruchemists have been interbreeding with the Allomancers. Basically, the Allomancy genes interfere with the Feruchemistry genes, breaking it down and creating the limitations we see in
*Alloy of Law*
. (His response to this was really funâ€”he found it a very perceptive question, and enjoyed talking about it. I wish I'd had my recorder handy so I could give you the full transcript instead of the boiled-down version.)
