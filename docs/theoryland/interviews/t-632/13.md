#### Wetlandernw

Are there mature Worms in
*A Memory of Light*
? Would a mature Worm be a dragon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO! (With a smile and a look that indicated we'll see something significant along that line, anyway.) As to the second part, they wouldn't really know what a dragon looked like, so they wouldn't call it that, anyway.
