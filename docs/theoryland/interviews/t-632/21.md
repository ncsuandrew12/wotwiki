#### Brandon Sanderson

For anyone who didn't know yet, he's doing another Great Hunt on this tour; the text to be revealed is a piece of RJ's notes, to give us an idea of the kind of information collected in those 3,000,000 words. (No, he didn't slip a clue into my book this year. It was too much to hope for... and with my list of questions, I completely forgot to ask about the Hunt!)
