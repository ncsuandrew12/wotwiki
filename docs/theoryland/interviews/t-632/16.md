#### Brandon Sanderson

*A Memory of Light*
is already near 300,000 words (he's marked it 90% on his web page), plus there's about 20,000 for RJ's ending, and BWS needs about another 20,000 to get the two joined up. It will likely end up at around 340,000 words—roughly the size of
*Towers of Midnight*
. He needs 2-3 good solid weeks of writing to finish it up, which will have to wait until this signing tour is over. He expects to finish the first draft by early December. Final release date will depend on how much time Harriet needs for editing as well as the marketing people's choice for good timing—like not going directly up against another major competitor for the #1 spot on the NYT Bestseller List. Sometime between July and November next year.
