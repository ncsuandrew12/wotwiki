# [Interview #632: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#7)

#### Wetlandernw

Who do you consider a "main character"? (How do you define "main"? Is Nynaeve, per tordotcom discussion?)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I consider the five original Two Rivers people, plus Elayne, to be "main characters." Min and Aviendha are major, but not quite at the same level.
