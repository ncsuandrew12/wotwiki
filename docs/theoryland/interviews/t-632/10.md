If
*cuendillar*
is brought into
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, can it be destroyed in a nightmare (the same way Perrin destroyed the dreamspike)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you were strong enough in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, you could probably force it to break, but it would remanifest itself pretty quickly. (He compared it to how Perrin was able to force Hopper back together for a moment, but no more—it snapped back to "reality" pretty fast.) RJ was pretty strong on this point—it's really, really hard to destroy the stuff. Even an opening gateway wouldn't do it—either the edge would push the
*cuendillar*
object out of the way, or the object would block the gateway from opening or closing. (You could actually block a gateway open by sticking a piece of
*cuendillar*
in it.) RJ was firm: there are only two ways for
*cuendillar*
to be destroyed: the Pattern unraveling, and... one other thing. (From the way he said "one other thing" I think we'll be learning about it in
*A Memory of Light*
. He enjoyed that question too.)

#### Footnote

Brandon said in
[another interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#14)
that the second way to destroy
*cuendillar*
is with the True Power.
