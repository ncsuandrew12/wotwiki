# [Interview #632: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw, Entry #18](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#18)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The contract has been signed for the Mistborn game, but he can't announce the company yet; they want to do a big announcement with cool artwork and stuff, and they aren't ready yet. BWS will be writing all the dialog and the ending to make sure it's a satisfying wrap-up, but he won't interfere in the game content. He'll have some voting rights over characterizations/actors. The announcement should come in January; it will be set as a prequel to the first Mistborn trilogy.
