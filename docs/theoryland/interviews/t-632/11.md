# [Interview #632: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#11)

Min has said that Perrin would need to be there for Rand twice to save him from something very bad. Assuming Dumai's Wells was the first time (which BWS confirmed), was Perrin's presence in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
at Dragonmount during Rand's time there the second time? Or, in another phrasing, has the second time happened yet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, that was not it. We have not yet seen the second time, but we will. (In other words, it's coming in
*A Memory of Light*
.)
