#### Loialson

What happened to the Jenn Aiel? What was their fate after we saw them last in the WayBack
*ter'angreal*
? I'm curious on how they disappeared after partially building Rhuidean. Were they consumed in the making of Rhuidean like the Aes Sedai that made the Eye of the World were? Or did they just stop procreating thus dying off, or something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Aah. RAFO!

#### WETLANDERNW

(The exclamation point, and a smile, was clear in his voice and in his eyes. He liked that question and was pleased to have it asked. We will apparently find out soon! Loialson—I'm sorry, I should have gotten you a RAFO card too. I only actually asked the first question—since it got the RAFO, I figured there was no point in asking the rest.)
