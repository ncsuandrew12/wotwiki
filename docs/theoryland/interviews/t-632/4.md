# [Interview #632, Entry #4]: Alloy of Law Signing Report - Wetlandernw](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#4)

#### Wetlandernw

In whose voice is the "Ars Arcanum" written? Hoid's?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've avoided answering that question. It's either Hoid or a member of the Seventeenth Shard. That's as much answer as I'm giving anyone right now.

#### Footnote

Brandon has later stated that the Ars Arcana Author is
*not*
Hoid.
