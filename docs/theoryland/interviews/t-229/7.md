# [Interview #229: KOD Signing Report - Shannan Lieb, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=229#7)

#### Question

One question was for a role-playing group, and they asked, "Would an Aes Sedai who has sworn the Three Oaths be able to link into a circle, but not lead it, that would be used to kill someone (not Shadowsworn or attacking)?"

#### Robert Jordan

He answered that no, an Aes Sedai wouldn't be able to join the circle or participate in any way with anything that was against the Oaths.
