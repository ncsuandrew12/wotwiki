# [Interview #229: KOD Signing Report - Shannan Lieb, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=229#1)

#### Shannan Lieb

This past Friday, October 21st, I had the great opportunity to travel to Dayton, Ohio for Robert Jordan's book signing at Books & Co. This was an especially enjoyable experience for me, as I was able to share it with my parents. We arrived at the signing at six o'clock, after my parents had driven from Columbus to Cincinnati, and then we all drove from Cincinnati to Daytonâ€”about 175 miles together. By the time we arrived, the stage area was completely occupied, and we received line numbers 100, 101 and 102. We looked around the bookstore, and staked out a location near the stage in case Mr. Jordan would have time to speak.
