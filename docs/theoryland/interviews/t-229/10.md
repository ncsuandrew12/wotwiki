# [Interview #229: KOD Signing Report - Shannan Lieb, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=229#10)

#### Shannan Lieb

We got up to the table where he was signing and I said hello again and introduced my parents. We walked around the table and took the picture, and then gave him our books to sign. There wasn't too much time to chat because of the line, but I mentioned that we were all really enjoying the blog, and understood that he wouldn't be able to post more than once every couple of weeks or so.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that he probably wouldn't be able to post much more frequently than that, and I said that we all understood and were really enjoying whenever he had time.
