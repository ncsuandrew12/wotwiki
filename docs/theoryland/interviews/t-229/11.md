# [Interview #229: KOD Signing Report - Shannan Lieb, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=229#11)

#### Shannan Lieb

After my mom, dad, myself and Harriet exited the signing area, I told Harriet it was great to see her again, and that I hoped to see her back at Dragon\*Con again in a couple of years after the next book comes out. We all said goodbye and thanks, and my parents and I left to go have dinner.

It was a wonderful time, and I feel flattered that Mr. Jordan and especially Harriet took time to talk with me and my family and really make it a memorable occasion. I would encourage everyone to go to a signing if there will be one near your home, and to let us know how it goes.
