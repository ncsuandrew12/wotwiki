# [Interview #229: KOD Signing Report - Shannan Lieb, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=229#3)

#### Robert Jordan

RJ came out onto the stage just after seven, and started by saying that he knew some of the crowd would probably be newcomers "that just picked up the first book..." and that he would start by clarifying some things. First, "the next book will be out very shortly after I'm done writing it." Next, "the next book will be the last book, even if it's 2000 pages, and you need a luggage cart to carry it out of the bookstore."
