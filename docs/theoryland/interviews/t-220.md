## Entry #1

#### Githraine

I was at the West Chester PA signing as well and had a few thoughts to add.

#### Robert Jordan

As others have mentioned, RJ gave us the working title of book 12 (
*A Memory of Light*
) and threatened it could be a 2000 page monster.

## Entry #2

#### Robert Jordan

He also said he would reveal Asmodean's killer in book 12 if he could do it naturally, otherwise he will announce it when book 12 hits paperback.

## Entry #3

#### Robert Jordan

RJ also mentioned the possibility of several 'outrigger' novels, a reversal on previous comments.

## Entry #4

#### Robert Jordan

He answered a number of questions about Infinity of Heaven and his writing style, and several more technical questions (it IS possible to create heartstone chainmail).

## Entry #5

#### Robert Jordan

He signed anything put in front of him that I saw and conversed happily with all. The turn out was smaller than I expected, but was well balanced across gender, race and age. (There were even 2 children, one under 12 who got several questions answered and one still in an infant stroller.)
