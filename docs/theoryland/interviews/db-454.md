## Entry #1

#### Matt Hatch

Note to readers—I did not transcribe the entire hour long conversation. Instead, I picked what I thought were the most important plot related items.

Enjoy,
  
Matt

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon summarizes why the next book will be a bit more chaotic than
*The Gathering Storm*
, which may make
*Towers of Midnight*
a longer book.
*The Gathering Storm*
feels focused, whereas the
*Towers of Midnight*
may not feel that way.

Brandon discusses Mistborn questions.

Brandon mentioned that Peter knows the secret.

## Entry #3

#### Matt Hatch

Did Robert Jordan leave a power to time comparison, as to how much time is burned back on a thread using balefire. Is there a calculation that says x amount of power will burn back x amount of time on a thread?

#### Brandon Sanderson

M.A.F.O—Maria and Find Out. What he did leave, he left a lot of stuff, there is discussion of these things in the notes. I need to look and see if there is an actual equation. He was very focused on strength of the Power and things like that. He has probably told you before, I think I’ve seen a copy of that on notes and things. He did leave scales on exactly how powerful each person is...

#### [MARIA SIMONS (VIA LUCKERS)](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/46013-mafo-answers/)

RAFO. Sorry, but we are doing an encyclopedia, and I have to reserve some things in case we want to put them in there.

#### Footnote

This is answered in more detail below, at entry #5.

## Entry #4

#### Matt Hatch

The Choedan Kal, does it amplify your power? Is it a limited, for example, if I have a certain amount of power does it give me 10x what I have, or is it a certain amount of power I can access?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One of the things I’ve been doing when I answer questions is that I’ve been saying that this is my understanding and putting an asterisk at the bottom that is a—I am speaking from my understanding and not from specific knowledge from the notes, meaning yes I am probably right but these are the questions I could be wrong on...this one my understanding is that it is a reservoir of power. It is not necessarily a magnification. A very weak person with a very powerful
*sa’angreal*
is very powerful. I’m pretty sure on that one, but I will add the asterisk just in case. If you send me an email, I can go back and look to make sure. But I’m reasonably sure on that one, the reasons being things that are talked about in the notes mixed with the way
*angreal*
and
*sa’angreal*
worked previously in the books mixed with two specific things that he talked about in the notes when people using
*angreal*
and
*sa’angreal*
after they become very weak or after they are weak.

#### Footnote

Brandon is presumably talking about Siuan and Moiraine, both of whom are weaker and supplemented by a
*sa'angreal*
and a strong
*angreal*
respectively. However, Brandon's explanation wouldn't explain why Elayne thought it prudent to give the
*angreal*
to the strongest women when the Bowl of the Winds was used. If it were simply a reservoir of power, then it wouldn't matter who used the
*angreal*
in a circle.

## Entry #5

#### Matt Hatch

We know that in the Age of Legends that the Forsaken/Chosen, everyone agreed to stop using balefire because of its effects on the Pattern. Is it unrealistic then to say that a great amount of power could burn someone’s thread back a year or six months? Is that an unrealistic thing to say that there is enough power available to either one or multiple people to burn somebody back that far?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I see what you are getting at you are trying to figure out if killed Graendal with a whole lot of balefire would bring Asmodean back to life.

#### MATT HATCH

...like that could ever happen...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

That’s what you are digging for isn’t it?

#### MATT HATCH

Let’s say, if a Forsaken was responsible for killing another Forsaken...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Uh huh...

#### MATT HATCH

And said Forsaken was balefired...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

You are under the assumption...You are trying to figure out who killed Asmodean again. That’s what you are trying to do and I’m not going to get caught and let you know...

#### MATT HATCH

It’s a legit question...and I’m sure whatever is said at this table stays at this table...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

I’m sure, the leader of Theoryland and the guy taping this... [much laughter] Let’s divorce it. Rand balefires Rahvin as hardcore as he could and Rand is one of the most powerful people to live and he got us—what have you determined?—from the lightning killing Mat until balefire killed Rahvin, I’d guess fifteen minutes.

#### MATT HATCH

Well, he at least got us fifteen minutes. We don’t know how far back, we just know up to that moment.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Well, we do know because if it had been too much further than that we would have noticed a lot of discrepancies in the Pattern from things he’d done...

#### MATT HATCH

Let’s say thirty minutes to an hour, at the most...

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Alright, thirty minutes to an hour. Okay, let’s say the Choedan Kal amplifies his abilities 100-fold...let’s say it’s a 100 times more powerful than Rand. That’s giving us, lets say he got an hour, we’ve got four days, from the most powerful, one of the most powerful
*sa’angreal*
ever created. I think it is unrealistic to assume you can get back a year, but that’s not saying it is impossible. I think that if you did that to the Pattern the ramifications would be so dramatic you’d see the Pattern unraveling hardcore at that point, it’s like balefiring an entire city. When I first read that guess I just laughed, I’m like guys c’mon lets run the math on this.

#### MATT HATCH

Like I said to Jennifer, it is my job at Theoryland to entertain these ideas.

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Yes it is, it is your job to entertain them. But in the terms of Mythbusters let’s go ahead and call that one “Busted” in the realistic world. I’ve got to give you at least something, so I’ll at least give you that...If it were possible to do things like that, we’d have the Dark One just going and balefiring you know Tam so Rand never gets picked up off the mountain. [...] I think it is more loose guidelines than it is a formula.

## Entry #6

#### Matt Hatch

I don’t think Jordan ever, maybe somebody asked, in his notes does he ever say what the treaties were between the 'Finns and the people with whom they made them? Are those treaties actually written down somewhere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um—I think that you may see some of this in the encyclopedia. How is that for a Robert Jordan answer for you? The encyclopedia is coming. [Stuff about the Big White Book]. It is actually going to be an encyclopedia...Harriet, Maria and Alan are working on that.
*A Memory of Light*
comes first so they have to keep dividing their time. My guess would be 2012, but if we’re really on the ball, I would think releasing it the same year of the last volume would be a smart thing to do...Peter will you take a note to let Maria know that I told them that that might happen so she is not blind sided by it. She and Harriet will have to decide if that goes in if anything regarding that goes in. The original treaty between the Aelfinn and Eelfinn and mankind. Just remind me to talk to Harriet to talk to Maria about it.

#### MATT HATCH

Are the treaties different?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Different from what?

#### MATT HATCH

There are two treaties...(hard to hear what I ask next, but I’m clarifying Snakes and Foxes).

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

They are similar, how about that. They are similar enough that they could be considered functionally identical but there are little differences.

## Entry #7

#### Matt Hatch

About the Upcoming Epic Magic Battle Between Brandon and Jason Denzel:

#### Brandon Sanderson

See, I’m expecting...the reason why I’m doing it like I’m doing it. I’m giving myself a handicap. I’m not going to draw back into my stock of super cards like I could do. I’m only going to use the cards I’ve been given. It’s the natural, smaller pool. I’m expecting him to go and build the uber-super-deck. He can reach to any cards he wants and build the perfect deck...he’s going to need the fans to tell him what to make and then to make it...I don’t feel sorry for Jason at all. He’s going to come at me with some uber-deck perfected by fans at tournaments...oh he’s good at getting sympathy, but I’m going to expose him for what he is...
