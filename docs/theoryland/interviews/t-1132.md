## [Entry #1](./t-1132/1)

#### Vaidd

I just got through the signing line. Since it was a mile long, I only asked about the Reckoners.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The ratio of Epics to normal folks is about 1 in 10,000. Brandon then clarified, without prompting, that was pre-Calamity population and the ratio is much higher now because so many normal people died. He then gave an example of Newcago, which has about 1000 Epics in a population of 250,000, so in that particular case the ratio is 1:250. (He didn't say, but I'd expect that to vary from place to place depending on the local politics.)

## [Entry #2](./t-1132/2)

#### Esmale

Will we ever see full Mistborn and/or Feruchemists again?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but they may be cobbled together...

#### Question

I meant more along the lines of a natural born Mistborn.

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

#### Tags

Allomancy

Feruchemy

## [Entry #3](./t-1132/3)

#### Esmale

In Sixth of Dusk, the advanced society that's trying to take advantage, have we seen them before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They've been referenced elsewhere.

## [Entry #4](./t-1132/4)

#### Esmale

? about Perfect State

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sophie, the robot that Melhi made to mess with Kai, is Melhi: she made a robot duplicate of herself. Brandon said that she actually feels kind of bad about all of it now...but that she's also rather messed up.

## [Entry #5](./t-1132/5)

#### KayMyth

OK, so in the signing line, I asked the question about chromium vs a Compounder with both invested and uninvested metals in both their stomach and piercings.

#### Brandon Sanderson

1) Yes, the piercings will get burned off.

2) The noninvested metals go before the invested ones. He said that because invested metals are harder to effect, it takes a little extra time and effort to get them to burn off. So a Leecher trying to clean out a Compounder would have to get a good grip and hang on for a few seconds.

3) Chromium burns about as quickly as duralumin, so if you're trying to burn off a lot of metals, it is possible to run out of chromium before your target is clean. This would probably only be an issue when dealing with larger pieces (like jewelry) rather than your standard metal-flakes-in-the-stomach deal.

#### Footnote

Sorry I don't have exact quotes, but there was a line and no easy way to take notes. :D
But what it boils down to is this:

## [Entry #6](./t-1132/6)

#### KayMyth

Question about ratios of mistings/ferrings in a population.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Straight WoB: the numbers in the AoL MAG supplement are off. (It states the occurrence of Mistings/Ferrings is 1 in 50 people.) He said that they're not terrible, but they definitely are shown as somewhat more common than they really are. But he also said that they're not nearly as rare as people seem to think; for example, he stated that virtually everyone would know at least one Coinshot. So there are definitely a lot of Allomancers around.
And the occurrence of Twinborn would not be a normal statistical spread (alas). As folks opined before in this thread, the Terris folk do tend to keep somewhat to themselves, so there's not a huge amount of population mix. So Twinborn will be rarer.
I did point out that there had to be some mix, else we'd be seeing full Feruchemists around, and to that he mostly just smiled and looked mysterious. As he does. And then he proceeded to trounce me in a game of Magic.
