#### Michele Dula Baum

Like the merchandising maelstrom that surrounds the "Star Trek" franchise, "Star Wars" and Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings," there are now role-playing games and trading cards. A company called Museum Replicas is recreating weapons, belt buckles and some "Wheel of Time" clothing.

#### Robert Jordan

NBC bought an option to do a miniseries based on the first book, but Jordan said odds are against a television movie, at least for now.

"I've been told the key people involved in getting that contract together have left NBC," he said. "That means it's highly unlikely the option will be exercised."

He finds this amusing in light of an apparent resurgence in sword-and-sorcery epics. A "Lord of the Rings" film is now being made in New Zealand, and a "Dungeons and Dragons" movie is set to open December 8.

Still, such things "are all peripheral, anyway," said Jordan. "The books are what's important to me."
