Heaven knows Web sites devoted to the series have certainly covered the Internet.

Last year, Croatia native Sebastian Mileta found a virtual "Wheel of Time" game while surfing. He had never heard of the books, but thought the game compelling. The enthusiasm he saw in book forums convinced him to read a bit.

"In the next two weeks, I read the first seven books in the series available then," he said. "I added
*Path of Daggers*
this winter and
*Winter's Heart*
(November 8)."

Now a university student in Boston, Massachusetts, Mileta said his only complaint is that the series "is too addictive." Sometimes he doesn't "sleep or eat so I can read the book in one try."

Fans have developed role-playing personalities based on characters in the series, and virtual communities have sprung up, matured, died off and been reborn in cyberspace.

All this leaves Jordan astonished and somewhat bemused.

"I look at some of it occasionally, and I've been sent lists of addresses," the author said. "It's quite daunting."
