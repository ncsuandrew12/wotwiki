Good, evil and magic

At its core, the story is as old as time. Young Rand al'Thor and his friends Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon become aware that evil is touching their pastoral village of Emond's Fieldâ€”a place so far away from anywhere that no one has seen a royal tax collector for generations. Up until now, their lives have been the same boring routine that made Luke Skywalker sigh down on the moisture farm on Tattooine.

Before long, however, the shepherd al'Thor, the blacksmith's apprentice Aybara, and the mischievous Cauthon are forced to abandon their homes in a desperate flight from the forces of ultimate evil. Their adventures bring them allies and enemies. Magic is real, and dangerous fairy tales spring to life.

The magic comes from a priesthood class called Aes Sedai that is able to "channel" the One Power, or the Force that turns the Wheel of Time.

For reasons Rand and his hayseed friends cannot imagine, the Dark One is after them, and unless they can prevail, the Shadow will cover the world.
