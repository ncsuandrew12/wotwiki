#### Question

Bigger trouble-maker: Mat or Nynaeve?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm actually leaning toward contradicting myself from last year on this one. I used to see Nynaeve as a big trouble maker, since I often empathized with the Perrin/Mat/Rand crowd. (I started reading these books as a teenage boy, and saw Nynaeve as a frustrating older sister.) However, on a re-read, I found myself empathizing with her quite often.

I'd still call her a trouble-maker, but not as big a one. Problem is, Mat isn't much of one lately either. He's a whole lot of funâ€”perhaps the character who is the most purely fun to write. I think he's interesting and well-developed. But what kind of trouble has he been making lately? (Besides kidnapping the Seanchan almost-Empress, of course. I guess that was a little bit of trouble. Particularly if you happen to be a Deathwatch Guard.)

I'm going to call it a draw.
