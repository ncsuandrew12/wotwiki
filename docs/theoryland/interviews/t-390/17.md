#### Question

Coolest wife: Tuon, or Faile?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Still Tuon. Faile is fascinating because of her effect on Perrin, and I do enjoy writing about her. (I'm not in the 'hate Faile' camp. Come on, guys. It's not HER fault that she got kidnapped for a couple of books. Besides, she really grows up a lot during her time in captivity.)

But you said coolest, so I have to answer honestly. Tuon.
