# [Interview #390, Entry #20]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Big Wheel of Time Interview Retrospective](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=390#20)

#### Question

Do you have a personal message for all the Wheel of Time fans?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thank you for your support. The response has been fantastic. I get emails each day cheering me on.

Thank you for your understanding. I can't replace the man you lost. But I'm doing my best to give you the book you've been waiting for.

And finally, thank you for your patience. I'm working hard, I promise. But this book is a HUGE undertaking, and will likely be three times the size of previous books I've written. Even considering the parts Mr. Jordan finished, there's just a lot to do, and I don't want to rush an imperfect product to production. We hope to have something for you in stores by November 2009. But if it takes longer, it takes longer.

#### Question

How should fans get in touch with you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Same as before. Through my website. As always, thanks for reading.
