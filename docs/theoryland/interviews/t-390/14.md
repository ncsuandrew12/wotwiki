# [Interview #390: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Big Wheel of Time Interview Retrospective, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=390#14)

#### Question

Robert Jordan has talked many times about how he knew the last chapter of the last book very well. Are you able to tell us whether or not he wrote that chapter before he died, or will that be something you'll be putting to paper? If so, does that chapter in particular hold any particular challenge or significance for you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I talked about this above. He did write down the last part of the book. I have it. It will appear in the final novel.
