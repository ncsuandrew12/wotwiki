# [Interview #390: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Big Wheel of Time Interview Retrospective, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=390#19)

#### Question

Who killed Asmodean? Come on, just tell us. Please. I won't tell Harriet you told me.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I answered this last year, but I was just joking. Now I've read the notes and I REALLY know who did it. Keep this as a secret between you and me, but it was Narg.

#### Question

Ok, if you won't tell us, will you tell us in
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It will be there. I promise.
