#### Robert Jordan

Jordan said that many fans want to know what he'll write next, and many want to know if he'll ever write about the Age of Legends. He said that other than the Wheel of Time series and the forthcoming Illustrated Guide, he's (probably) not going to write anything else in the same setting. The Illustrated Guide to the Wheel of Time will contain:

> \* The history and rise of Artur Hawkwing
>   
> \* The formation of the modern Aes Sedai organization (i.e., post-Breaking)
>   
> \* The Aiel War, especially the Battle of the Shining Walls (which will be told from several different viewpoints)
>   
> \* Some things about the Seanchan not included in the WoT story
>   
> \* Art by someone other than Darrell K. Sweet

This is not a complete list of what will be in the Illustrated Guide.
