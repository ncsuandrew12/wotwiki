## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#1)

#### little wilson

Are any of the Lord Ruler's descendants kandra?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No.

#### little wilson

Have we seen any them in Era 2?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### little wilson

Where?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a lot of descendants, percentage-wise, but you're looking for something that isn't there. There are descendants of the Lord Ruler, but there's not some secret coven. It's not outside of reason to say that some of his descendants are part of a coven, but it's not like some super-secret magic society.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#2)

#### little wilson

You mentioned that "half-ish" of the existing Shards are whole at the time of Shadows of Self. Is that counting splinters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Splintered is one of the ways they are not considered whole. (He's thinking about Dominion and Devotion and says that's the opposite of whole)

#### little wilson

I was thinking about shattered versus splintered, and going with shattered with Devotion and Dominion. And then splintered would be Honor separating a piece of himself to create the spren (pre-Shattering).

#### Brandon Sanderson

On Scadrial, Ruin and Preservation did the same thing. Their bodies are part of the world. Things on the spiritual realm don't matter where they are in relation to each other. All those spren are still Honor, when he was alive. Does that make sense? Yes, they're splinters of Honor, but they're still Honor. It's not like he's diminished, because his whole essence is the world. There's no diminishing that. So we're talking about the fracturing of the mind and killing of the Shard. That's the distinction between whole and not whole.

#### little wilson

Are there any Shards we don't know of that are Shattered?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. (Zas' sister says "Four....ish...right?") Eh....Honor is gone. Devotion and Dominion are gone. There are others. The question is is Cultivation gone or not? I haven't answered that for you. There are others. So this is why I'm not going to give you answers on this.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#3)

#### little wilson

Does Bavadin have a sibling?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#4)

#### little wilson

Can you give us any hints about Vax's magic system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

NO.
(To which Isaac says something about a magic system based on RAFO: the more RAFO you get, the more Investiture you're able to hold)

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#5)

#### mail-mi

Can you tell us which hemalurgic spike transfers temporal allomancy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. Well, I could tell you, but I'm not going to.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#6)

#### mail-mi

Are the IRE old enough to have gone through the Reod?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They're really old. Really really really really old. \*signs book\* Really old.

#### Footnote

Then, as I walked passed Isaac, he said "They're like this old," said in a stereotypical old grandpa voice, then in a normal voice "It's almost midnight, that's when the voices come out." :P

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#7)

#### zas678

How long is a Nalthis year?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's a PAFO. I don't remember off of the top of my head, but there's a limited range of what it could be do to the "Goldilocks" zone. (The zone in which habitable planets can align so it's cool enough for water but not so cold that it's ice).

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#8)

#### zas678

How long ago was the Recreance from modern day or from the Heirocracy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Heirocracy is in recent history, the Recreance is in ancient history.

## [Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#9)

#### zas678

Did Vasher visit Roshar before or after the Recreance? I ask because he probably had to have seen a live Shardblade to model Nightblood after, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Vasher didn't have to have seen a live Shardblade. He could've heard stories and modeled Nightblood after those.

## [Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#10)

#### zas678

Chronology?

#### Brandon Sanderson

For the chronology, there is a specific timeline of when the events are, but Karen's the one that's in charge of that.

## [Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1149#11)

#### CarolaDavar

Does the pool in Elantris have anything to do with the Pool that Rock mentions is in his homeland?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Look closely at who he says comes through that pool (I took this as a yes, I later found out that my Mom asked him if Hoid travels through the pool, and Brandon said yes, he worldhops through the pool)
