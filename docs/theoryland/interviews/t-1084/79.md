# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #79](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#79)

#### Question

Hi Brandon, love your work and I appreciate you doing the Q&A. I absolutely love the fact that your Stormlight books are so big. I enjoy the feeling of starting such an epic quest and pushing myself to complete higher word count books. That being said, is there a possibility that we might see a 450k, maybe even a 500k word book by the end of the Stormlight Archive or by the end of the Cosmere works? Take care!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Thanks for the kind words!

It's certainly possible. I will write them at the length they need to be. After 400k, though, the print has to start shrinking which makes reading more and more difficult.
