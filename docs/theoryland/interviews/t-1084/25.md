# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#25)

#### Question

How much time do you usually spend on creating a magic system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It really depends on the book, the length of the story, and how integral to magic is to that particular story. Some are as fast as a couple of days; some take months and months. It is also difficult to answer this question because I spend a lot of time thinking about a book before writing, and the Magic is often part of that. I will often spend years with an idea growing in the back of my mind before writingâ€”and in those cases, the actual "outlining" may take a month, but that doesn't begin to cover the time spent on the idea.
