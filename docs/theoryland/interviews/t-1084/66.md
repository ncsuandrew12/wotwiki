# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #66](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#66)

#### Question

Are you planning to release
*White Sand*
as a graphic novel exclusively, or will the story be published as a regular novel further down the line? Either way, can't wait to read it!

#### Brandon Sanderson

The plan is graphic novel right now. We'll see how the reception is, but I think it would be awesome if this entry into the cosmere story were always in graphic form.
