# [Interview #1084, Entry #45]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#45)

#### Question

You have a lot of books potentially coming out in the next couple of years. Is there a particular order that you are writing the books in? As in Cosmere-only one year and then Rithmatist and Reckoners in another? Or do you write whatever suits your whim at a given time, aside from basic outlines?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's more the latter. I've found that to be productive and creative, I have to be willing to let myself jump to the projects I'm most excited about at the moment.
