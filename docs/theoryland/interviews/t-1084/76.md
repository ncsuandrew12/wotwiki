# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #76](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#76)

#### Question

Is there a way to get a print copy of
*Aether of the Night*
? It's probably my second-favorite out of your books, and I would love a copy for the shelf.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Feel free to print yourself out a personal copy and get it bound. :) Maybe someday I'll do something myself, but there are no plans right now.
