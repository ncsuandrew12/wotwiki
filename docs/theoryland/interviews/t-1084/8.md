# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#8)

#### Question

What advice would you give to someone who is trying to write an epic fantasy novel for the first time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Turn off the internal editor. Write with passion, and don't spend a lot of time on revision. You will grow so quickly as a writer during your first book that you want to power through it, learn a lot about the process, THEN do your revisions. Otherwise, you might end up stuck in an endless loop of revising the first few chapters.

Also, don't spend so long planning that you don't get around to writing. The goal is to train yourself to learn how to writeâ€”and you only do that by actually writing.
