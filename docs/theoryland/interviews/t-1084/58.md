# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#58)

#### Question

Do all your books take place in the same world or if they don't how do characters/objects travel between worlds e.g. Nightblood, Zahel/Vasher??

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are on different worlds, but in the same universe. There are clues throughout (starting in
*Elantris*
) about how people jump between planets. It will be more clear in the future, but you might want to google the "cosmere" and read what people have theorized so far.
