# [Interview #1084, Entry #51]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#51)

#### Question

Can I read your Wheel of Time books without reading the ones you didn't write and still understand and enjoy them? I hate that there are books you wrote that I haven't read and I am finding it impossible to even get through chapter 1 of the first Wheel of Time.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I sincerely doubt you will like my entries into the series if you didn't like the earlier books. The characters and setting were what made me passionate about finishing the series, and I didn't come into the WoT to change or fix it—only to do the best I could at fulfilling what it already was.

Now, mind you, it's perfectly all right for you not to like them. Not every series is for every person, and the WoT just might not be to your taste.

If—despite this—you really want to try mine out, you can read very detailed summaries of the previous books on http://encyclopaedia-wot.org/. These are chapter by chapter, so it will probably take you a while to get through them.
