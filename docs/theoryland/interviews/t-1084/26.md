# [Interview #1084, Entry #26]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#26)

#### Question

I love stories in any medium, and I would love to tell one myself. But, I don't think I have anything in particular to say that hasn't been done a thousand times before. I invariably come across some story that already parallels my ideas. What makes a story worth telling even when its like has been done before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The answer is simple: YOU are what makes your story worth telling. Harry Potter wasn't an original story, and yet told very well, it became an excellent series.

My suggestion to you is to ask what unique passions or life experiences you have that aren't found in the average fantasy book. This genre still has a lot of room to grow. A person passionate about sports could write a very different fantasy novel from one passionate about lawn careâ€”assuming they take what they know and love and make us, as readers, come to know and love it as well.

Good luck!
