# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #71](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#71)

#### [E.N. Weiry/WeiryWriterÂ (Goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/109263-in-elantris-the-aon-used-for-healing-is)

In
*Elantris*
the Aon used for healing is Aon Ien, but the definition given in the back of the book says it means "Wisdom". The other Aons have effects and definitions that go together, but "Healing" and "Wisdom" don't seem to match. Is there something there or is it an error?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's more a cultural thing. When I was naming the Aons I had some of them cross-align like this because I feel that languages, and cultures, are often messy. (Drive on a parkway, park in a driveway kind of issues.) This is the only one that ended up in the glossary that was like this, though, so I probably should have spotted that and changed it.
