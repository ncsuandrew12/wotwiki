# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #36](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#36)

#### Question

In the Wheel of Time books, did the Creator have a power, similar to the True Power that the Dark One had?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm afraid I don't have the answer for this, not for certain. I think that readers of the text could argue both ways. For example, a certain event in the epilogue of AMOL could be interpreted this wayâ€”though everyone in Team Jordan seems to have a different opinion on what is going on, and RJ didn't leave an explanation.
