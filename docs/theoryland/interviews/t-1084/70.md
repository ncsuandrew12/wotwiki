# [Interview #1084, Entry #70]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#70)

#### Question

If a non-Windrunner Surgebinder (who had spoken all the Ideals of their Radiant Order) summoned Jezrien's Honorblade, what color eyes would they get? A blend? Different colors for each eye?

#### Brandon Sanderson

:) I'm going to RAFO eye color questions for the moment. We'll actually be dealing with some of these in the books. Maybe not the specific ones you ask, but the concepts in general.
