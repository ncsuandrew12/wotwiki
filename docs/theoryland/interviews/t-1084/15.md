# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#15)

#### Question

The "God Surges" you mentioned recently, are they a part of the
*Way of Kings*
frontsheet?

You've said that there are three types of Blades in the Stormlight Archive. We've seen "dead" Shardblades, Honorbladesâ€”is the third type the "living spren" Shardblades, or is there another type we haven't seen?

Do all Surgebinders breathe Stormlight in, or are there other ways? Is Lift one-of-a-kind in this regard?

#### Brandon Sanderson

All I said regarding this was to tell a fan that it was possible to make an analogy between the god metals on Scadrial and certain powers on Roshar. However, these are not a codified part of the magic system.

Lift is one of a kind.

Nightblood is a very unique kind of Shardblade, but IS a Shardblade.
