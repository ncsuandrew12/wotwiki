# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#55)

#### Question

In
*Well of Ascension*
, it mentions that the language of Terris had a gender neutral pronoun. If you actually constructed the language, what was that pronoun? Or did you just leave it as its English translation of "it"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I didn't spend a long time on the languages in Scadrial, since most people were speaking the same tongue. I just used "it" in my own writings. Roshar has a lot more detail on the languages, because culture-clash is a bigger part of the theme of the series.
