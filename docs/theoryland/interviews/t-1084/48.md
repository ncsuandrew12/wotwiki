# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #48](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#48)

#### Question

Will we see a new Alcatraz Book anytime soon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I have finished Alcatraz 5, but I don't know what the publication schedule for it will be. I think Tor wants to re-release the first four before doing five.
