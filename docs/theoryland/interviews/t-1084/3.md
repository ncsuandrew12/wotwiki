# [Interview #1084, Entry #3]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#3)

#### [M.M. SchillÂ (Goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/109536-i-always-wondered-you-say-you-produce)

I always wondered. You say you produce clean drafts, and you apparently produce stories quickly (relatively to a lot of people I've met.), how do you keep cranking it away? What is the motivation to keep creating? (I think this might be the key to why some many people start and never finish projects. ??)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm not actually a fast writer, hour by hour, but I am very consistent. I enjoy writing, but I will admit, some days it is hard. What keeps me going? This has changed over the years. At first, it was a desire to prove myself, and to make a living doing this thing I love. Eventually, it has transitioned into a feeling of obligation to the readers mixed with a desire to see these stories in my head told.
