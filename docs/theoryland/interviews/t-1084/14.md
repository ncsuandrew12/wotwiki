# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#14)

#### Question

How do you feel on being read and worshiped as one of the best writers in the world by people that don't even speak English?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Humbled, honestly. I don't know if "worshiped" is the right term, and I would hope that most people are focused on the stories, rather than on me. They're what matter. That said, it has been incredible to see the reception my work has received.
