# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #56](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#56)

#### Question

What is the term for a full Feruchemist who is also a Mistborn?

Can "modern"(as in: Adolin's) Shardplate be summoned similar to how "dead" Shardblades (as in: Oathbringer) can be?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They use Full Feruchemist right now. We'll see if it develops into something else.

RAFO.
