# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #85](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#85)

#### Question

Will you ever come somewhere close to Croatia to promote your books, like Italy or Austria?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do see myself getting to Italy or Austriaâ€”but I don't know about Croatia itself. It depends on if a publisher or convention invites me!
