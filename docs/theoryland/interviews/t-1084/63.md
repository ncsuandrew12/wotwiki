# [Interview #1084, Entry #63]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#63)

#### Question

"Sixth of the Dusk" doesn't have much that directly ties it to the Cosmere. Is this a world we'll see later?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is not hugely important to the cosmere. We will see signs and hints of it, but don't expect a book set there.
