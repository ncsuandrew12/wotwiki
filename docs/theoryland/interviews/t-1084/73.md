# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #73](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#73)

#### Question

Hi Brandon. Firstly I would like to say thank you for coming to Manchester last week. I really enjoyed the readings and book signing. I am currently reading
*The Way of Kings*
and my question is Do you get inspiration for the settings in your books from anywhere?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Settings are often inspired by something I've seen in our world, then taken to the extreme. The storm on Roshar, the mists on Scadrial...even
*Elantris*
was based on my readings about leper colonies.
