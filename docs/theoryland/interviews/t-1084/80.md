# [Interview #1084, Entry #80]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#80)

#### Question

Hi! First of all thank you for answering our questions :)

*Shadows Beneath*
the Writing Excuses anthology is available in digital format on Amazon or in hardback in your store but if you are from Europe is really expensive to buy it. Will the hardback be available on Amazon some day?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I don't think it will be. :( This would require us to get Amazon to stock it, I believe, which I don't think will happen. But I'll look into this.
