# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #54](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#54)

#### Question

What kind of college classes (not English courses) would best prepare someone for writing fantasy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Whatever you're fascinated by! You can incorporate basically anything into a story. If you love numbers, study economics. If you like history, pick an area and type and become an expert. Whether it be law or botany, you will find a way to use it in your books.

I enjoyed my creative writing classes, but they don't tend to be as useful as gaining an expertise in an area, then letting that make your stories have a passion and weight to them.
