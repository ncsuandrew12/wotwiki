# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #22](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#22)

#### Question

Out of all the books you've written which do you think is the best?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well,
*Emperor's Soul*
is the one that won a Hugo, which gives it some objective credibility for being the best. AMOL was the hardest by a long shot, and in some ways the most satisfying, but I'm perhaps most proud of
*The Way of Kings*
. So one of those three, likely.
