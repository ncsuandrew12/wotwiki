# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#69)

#### [KurkistanÂ (Goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/109483-could-miles-heal-back-his-allomancy-if-it)

Could Miles heal back his Allomancy if it was spiked out of him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, he could not. He would no longer be an Allomancer. Also, he'd probably be dead. :)

#### Kurkistan

I'd thought maybe he could just do some super-tapping from his existing Health in his goldminds (since he'd still have his Feruchemy)...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, I see what you're asking. Using Feruchemy to heal the removed portion of soul. That's actually plausible, not so different from healing other kinds of soul-wounds. If he survived, then yes, this actually might work. (That's why I get for reading the questions so quickly.)
