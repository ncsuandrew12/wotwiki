# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#4)

#### [Noah HillÂ (Goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/109556-is-there-any-chance-we-will-have-a-deeper)

Is there any chance we will have a deeper backstory for Bridge 4 members? Maybe an anthology or something with short stories that detail backstory for Rock, Lopen, etc? That would be amazing!

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do intend to dig into some of them a little. (Rock, for example, is currently plotted to have a viewpoint sequence in a later book.)
