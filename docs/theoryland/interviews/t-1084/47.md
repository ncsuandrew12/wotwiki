# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #47](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#47)

#### Question

How much do you use science to influence/guide your world building in what most people would identify as a fantasy setting?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I use it quite a bit, but as I'm writing fantasy, I go by the rule "do what is awesome first, then explain it." Meaning, I am looking to tell a certain kind of story, and while science is often a springboard into a magic, I will sometimes chose to do what I think makes the story better as opposed to what is scientifically rational. The way the metallic arts work with mass is one example.
