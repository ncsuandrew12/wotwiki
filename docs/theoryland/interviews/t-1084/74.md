# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #74](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#74)

#### Question

Is there anything in particular that inspires you to come up with new stories and/or magic systems?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Really, anything can be the seed. Reading about science and scientific discoveries tends to be the most helpful, but I can't say specifically what leads me to create them. (Though I'd suggest looking at "Sanderson's Laws" of magic for a longer explanation.)
