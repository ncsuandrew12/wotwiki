# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #57](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#57)

#### Question

Brandon, your books are always seamless and so well put together. Do you use any specific software when compiling a story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm afraid I don't. I use Microsoft Word. Compiling is all done the old-fashioned way with lots of editing.
