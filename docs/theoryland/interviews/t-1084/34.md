# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#34)

#### Question

On Roshar, do they have an equivalent for cats, like how they have axehounds instead of dogs?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, they do not. Though there are various domesticated animals fulfilling a similar role across the planet. (Domesticated minks and pigs come to mind.)
