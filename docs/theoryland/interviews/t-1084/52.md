# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #52](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#52)

#### Question

Are you stopping work on Rithmatist 2 to start Stormlight Archive #3? I've seen and heard snippets of SA #3 from your signings/visits and was wondering if you were ignoring the Rithmatist.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I never REALLY started on Stormlight 3. I'm just doing planning and outlining right now, with the occasional scene to give me focus. I can't say right now exactly when I will finish it or Rithmatist 2, though I'm working on both.
