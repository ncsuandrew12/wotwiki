# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #39](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#39)

#### Question

Although I have become a big fan of your work, it's not until recently that I've discovered you thanks to
*Mistborn*
. Even more recently, I've found out about Cosmere (I have to say that that, Sir, is a brilliant idea). I know that you are writing more than one saga at the same time, so my question is: Should I read your books in any specific order to get the right picture of Cosmere or is it ok however I read them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They should be okay read in any order so far! Eventually, there will be books that rely on Cosmere knowledge, but those haven't been written yet.
