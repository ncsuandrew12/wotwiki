# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #78](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#78)

#### Question

Hi Brandon! When you're writing/planning a new series, how much time would you say you spend on world building? Do you like to have a good sense of the world before you starting writing or do you adapt and evolve the world as you write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do a moderate amount ahead of time, but it depends on the seriesâ€”most importantly, the length of the book. If I'm writing a shorter work, I can develop more on-the-fly, knowing I can make it all consistent after the fact. If I'm writing in a series, I need much more ahead of time. Developing the world for
*The Way of Kings*
took years.
