# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#60)

#### Question

Were there any characters you found difficult to connect with when writing the remaining books of The Wheel of Time series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I've never really been able to get into Cadsuane as a character, and so she was the most difficult for me to do. I love Aviendha and Tuon, but both of them think so differently from the rest of the characters that they gave me a challenge.
