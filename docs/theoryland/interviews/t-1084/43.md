# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#43)

#### Question

How do you keep so many different worlds you created separate so they don't "float" into each other?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Lots of notes, a good internal wiki, and an even better continuity editor. (In the form of Peter Ahlstrom.)
