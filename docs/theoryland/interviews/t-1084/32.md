# [Interview #1084, Entry #32]: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#32)

#### Question

How quickly are you able to get back into the storyline flow when you begin another book? e.g. Do you have to review notes extensively for a few days? Thanks.

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is one of the most difficult things for me to do. I wish I had a better way to do it, actually. I usually lose a few days or more while trying to get into a book I've stopped for some reason. My primary method is to read what I've written before (or, if it is a new book in a series, the last part of the previous book.) That tends to help get me into a mood, so to speak. But it can take days of thinking, working, and throwing away my work to get into the groove.
