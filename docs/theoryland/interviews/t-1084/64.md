# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #64](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#64)

#### Question

My wife is curious about where your inspiration comes from when coming up with names of people, places, magic systems, etc. what would you say?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They come from all over! Inspiration is a tough thing to pin down. I've had casual meetings, long-time friends, movies I loved, movies I hated, passing something interesting on the freeway, visits to museums, and basically anything else give me an idea. I'm generally looking for some kind of interesting conflict.
