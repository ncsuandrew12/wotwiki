# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#31)

#### Question

Does Shardplate have one general style as a pattern, or do different types exist (like European armour vs. japanese armour), as the different kingdoms have different cultures?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Different types exist, but it's more along order lines than cultural ones. (That said, a person's culture could certainly influence their armor.)
