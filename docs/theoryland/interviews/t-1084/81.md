# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #81](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#81)

#### Question

Does the metal on Sel contains within it any sort of spren-like being, or anything similar to that, and also, does the splintered nature of the Shards on (Elantris' world) have anything to do with how the magic manifests itself without a physical representation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Scadrial (Mistborn world) did not have an analogous, self-aware invested set of entities. The power has to be "let go of" in a way.
