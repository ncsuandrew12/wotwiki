# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#11)

#### Question

My eight-year-old daughter read
*Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia*
first in a deliberate bid to get you to throw things at her. Any chance you can oblige?

#### Brandon Sanderson

How about a thrown compliment?

"YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A VERY BRIGHT YOUNG LADY."

You can print that off and toss it at her, if you want. :)
