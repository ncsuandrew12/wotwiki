# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#27)

#### Question

Out of all the books you've written so far, which character is your favorite?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can't answer that, I'm afraid, as it would be like trying to tell you which of my children is my favorite! When asked this question, Robert Jordan would just say, "My favorite is the one I'm working on right now." I like that answer.
