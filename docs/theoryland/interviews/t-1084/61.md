# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #61](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#61)

#### Question

In your opinion who is stronger in the the world of dreams? Perrin or Egwene?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'd say that at this point, it's less a matter of who is stronger, and more a matter of what they're doing. Perrin could probably win a fight, but his raw knowledge and understanding is lessâ€”he works on instinct.
