# [Interview #1084: Ask the Author: Brandon Sanderson, Entry #75](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1084#75)

#### Question

Do you have any advice for aspiring writers who are educated in a field other than literature and in a profession already that is not centered around writing?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes! I'll tell you that you're in luck. Take what you've learned in your field of education, and in your profession, and apply it to your writing. RJ used his experience as a solider; Grisham made a career out of writing books related to his work. You have special experience and knowledge that will make your books distinctive. Make use of it!
