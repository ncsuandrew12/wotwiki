#### [Jerry DolÂ (Goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/109526-do-you-think-that-there-will-ever-be-a)

Do you think that there will ever be a movie trilogy or tv series of the Stormlight Archive like they have done with Game of Thrones and Harry Potter?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Boy, I'd love it if there were. I will work to make it happen, though with Stormlight I probably won't be optioning the books for film until a few more are out. I don't have a lot of power over what Hollywood decides to do, though.
