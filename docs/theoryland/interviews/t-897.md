#### [Clayton Boyd (3 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/ClaytonBoyd_SA/status/286768745215561728)

Excited about
*Memory if Light*
in a week. Any idea about book 2 of Stormlight Archive?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (3 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/286776938113159168)

Next fall, hopefully.

#### [James Powell (3 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/feelieking/status/286945919633612800)

PS. if we ever do manage to have dinner, we should talk about the
[Ship of Theseus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)
. [Peter's note: Brandon references this in Alcatraz 2.]

#### [Brandon Sanderson (3 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/286970777499230208)

:)

## [Entry #3](./t-897/3)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (6 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288131681418887168)

Warning: Churchiness follows! Just saw Bruce R. McConkie's
[final testimony](http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1985/04/the-purifying-power-of-gethsemane?lang=eng&media=video)
(from back in 1985) for the first time. Wow.

#### [Howard Tayler](http://twitter.com/howardtayler/status/288132080410451970)

Amazing, isn't it? AMAZING. We watched it when I was in the
[MTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_Training_Center)
.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288132413811466242)

Yeah. I'm surprised I missed it. 18 months of cancer, this, then dead in about a week. Gave me chills.

#### [Melissa Hunt](https://twitter.com/verinSedai/status/288132162576850944)

Oh no, no church for me. I might fall asleep. Oh man, I'm horrible.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288132509458382848)

Lol. :)

#### [Alan Horne](https://twitter.com/TAlanHorne/status/288156809456406530)

I'm super surprised you haven't heard it before. It's, like, everywhere in the Church.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288187922505666560)

Yeah, I've heard it mentioned—but just never watched/heard it.

## [Entry #4](./t-897/4)

#### [Brent Weeks (8 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/brentweeks/status/288750583752556544)

I have yet to meet an SFF writer who thinks they could have done a better job finishing the WoT than @BrandSanderson has done.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288754319585579011)

Thanks, Brent. And congrats on making just about everyone's "best books of 2012" list. You deserve it.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288795756008181761)

Jumped on the internet on the plane flight. Thought "I'll check my email quickly." Ten billion new emails. Oh, right. New book out . . .

#### [Marc Rivera](https://twitter.com/Monkeyboy723/status/288812424365211648)

Sorry, I was overly excited about the book. My bad.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288816786290405376)

Ha. No, it makes me feel loved. Thanks! Unless you sent them all. Then you are scaring me.

#### [Rob Houston](https://twitter.com/Houston593/status/289084629883957248)

How do you handle that? Interns? You can't possibly read them all yourself.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289087740266549248)

I try to at least look all of them over. Most can be answered quickly with a pre-written email.

#### [John Scalzi](https://twitter.com/scalzi/status/288797988581687297)

HUMBLEBRAG SOME MORE, BRANDON.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288799166237388802)

WHAT DO YOU KNOW? YOU'RE JUST A DIRTY SELL-OUT! SCALZIIIII!!!! :)

#### [Christopher Turkel](https://twitter.com/zizban/status/288802857124253697)

I am taking bets on the impending @scalzi and @BrandSanderson knife match.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288804549643345921)

Scalzi writes SF. He'd bring a laser rifle. This is why I only taunt him from 30k feet in the air.

#### [John Scalzi](http://twitter.com/scalzi/status/288805413024047104)

IT'S A COHERENT BEAM, FANTASY BOY. ONLY THE CURVE OF THE EARTH WILL SAVE YOU NOW

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288811739439583233)

. . . Did you just call me your "fantasy boy?" I don't quite know how to take that.

## [Entry #5](./t-897/5)

#### [Umbriss (8 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Serradarc/status/288799860298244096)

Do you have a current list of M:tG cards you want? Going to the signing tomorrow in Skokie, IL and might bring a present.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (8 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/288801820615245824)

You don't need to do that! But my cube is still missing both a Tangle Wire and a Tooth and Nail. They're hard to find, though.

## [Entry #6](./t-897/6)

#### [Chris Kluwe (9 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/status/289141030324940801)

Just finished
*A Memory of Light*
, by @BrandSanderson. Very well written, and satisfyingly conclusive. NOW MOAR STORMLIGHT. #crackswhip

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289143293160333313)

Wow. That was fast. :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289144056506884097)

You weren't at the signing last night, were you?

#### [Chris Kluwe](http://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/status/289146360429703168)

Was
[doing the Colbert Report](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/422719/january-08-2013/chris-kluwe)
. :( And then I saw you posted the signed copies in the airport after I already flew back :(:(

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289149068347863040)

Ha. Good. I'd hate to have you come & not have me recognize you. (Mark Tremonti did that to me.) PM if you want a signed copy.

#### [Chris Kluwe](http://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/status/289149553620447232)

I'll catch you at another one so I can bring all the other books I need signed :p

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289149750467497984)

Sounds good! Thanks.

## [Entry #7](./t-897/7)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289157242224259072)

So . . . While the plane was landing, I had a great idea for fixing
*Death By Pizza*
, a novel I abandoned a few years ago. NOT RIGHT NOW, BRAIN.

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](http://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/289157563184975872)

Yay!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289159899944996864)

Lol. Have you even read that one?

#### [Peter Ahlstrom](https://twitter.com/PeterAhlstrom/status/289160469367906304)

No. But I wanted to react anyway.

#### [Vyrrk](https://twitter.com/Vyrrk/status/289158633172905984)

You and your ideas on planes! Isn't that how
*Legion*
got started?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289159564367114240)

Yeah, traveling does that to me. Mistborn started while I was driving on a road trip.

#### [Priscilla Anderson](https://twitter.com/Panderson22/status/289158574591078400)

Given I don't know anything about you besides the fact that you're a ridiculously talented writer, that title and you don't seem in-sync.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289159734190297088)

Heh. It was one of my "breather projects." Stories I free-write (rather than planning in detail) between larger books.

## [Entry #8](./t-897/8)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289118414205775872)

Traveling through Minneapolis/St Paul? I managed to visit and sign
*A Memory of Light*
at 3 of the 4 airport bookstores (Main concourse and C gates.)

#### [nwash10](https://twitter.com/nwash10/status/289119725412286464)

Always been curious about stealth signings. Do you say anything to bookstore employees or are you kind of sketchy about it?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289120225297846272)

Depends. I usually try to introduce myself, but if they are busy or don't look interested, I'll just sign and go.

#### [Jamie Lloyd](https://twitter.com/Jamie__Lloyd/status/289160903507722240)

Even though I don't live in the US, I love how you sign random copies of your books in airports. Shows you care! :)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289162920644993024)

I do this in the UK when I visit, but authors randomly stopping by happens less there, so I tend to get into more trouble. :)

## [Entry #9](./t-897/9)

#### [Justin Kirklin (10 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/JustinKirklin/status/289455825917980674)

Is Kaladin in Stormilight 2?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289457642080989184)

Yes, quite a bit.

## [Entry #10](./t-897/10)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (10 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289485321421332480)

Dayton airport has 6 Brandalized books in the bookstore on the way to the B gates. Bookseller was reading a magazine. Didn't even look up.

#### [Mignon Fogarty](http://twitter.com/GrammarGirl/status/289486428986028033)

"Brandalized"? Nice!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289487163811328000)

I can't claim it. My fans invented it to describe my stealth signings.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 January)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290946042550181888)

Ha! @GrammarGirl is awesome. Readers who coined "Brandalized," you have been given a
[shout-out](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/brandalized.aspx)
.

## [Entry #11](./t-897/11)

#### [Closed Unsink (9 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/ClosedUnsink/status/289184457448124416)

Your website says at the Atlanta signing priority "may be" given to those who purchased the book from hosting store.

#### [Closed Unsink](https://twitter.com/ClosedUnsink/status/289184871602061313)

Seems silly to deny loyal fans a chance for lack of buying the book at one specific store.

#### [Brandon Sanderson (9 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289686321771970560)

I used to be pretty annoyed by these kinds of restrictions (which are placed by the store, not by me or the publisher.)

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289686525942308864)

Then I attended a signing with well over a hundred people, for which the store had to hire extra staff, stay open late...

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289686753009344512)

And rearrange their store to accommodate. They sold six copies and lost money since everyone brought their Amazon books.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/289686926372519936)

I can see how stores get annoyed by such things. It didn't used to happen, but e-sales have changed the game.

## [Entry #12](./t-897/12)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (12 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290133835084099584)

Passing through Atlanta? Signed copies of
*A Memory of Light*
at the Buckhead books in the middle of the B terminal. (Look in new releases, not sf/f.)

#### [Kevin J Anderson](https://twitter.com/TheKJA/status/290135118016823296)

I think the UNSIGNED copies are going to be a rare collectible item!

#### [Brandon Sanderson](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290137649648381952)

Ha. I've signed around 5k copies so far. So you aren't far off. Don't you still hold the one-day world record, though?

#### [Kevin J Anderson](https://twitter.com/TheKJA/status/290144080292352001)

I think Dave Wolverton broke my record, and then Howard Stern. But I still have my Guinness World Record certificate.

#### [Christopher Paolini](https://twitter.com/InheritanceCP/status/290160942958927872)

Hmm. Well I did do 9,400 in two days before the launch of
*Inheritance*
.

#### [Kevin J Anderson](https://twitter.com/TheKJA/status/290176848346882049)

Next time have a Guinness official looking over your shoulder. I do NOT intend to break that record again.

#### [Peter Orullian](https://twitter.com/PeterOrullian/status/290204245423173632)

Pretty sure Dave's got the record. Not sure on quantity.

## [Entry #13](./t-897/13)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (13 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290556518259097600)

Atlanta airport Simply Books in the A terminal center has signed books! (Same for the B terminal Buckhead books from yesterday.)

#### [Jared Steward](https://twitter.com/JaredSteward/status/290558260128387073)

That's cool. Have you ever gotten in trouble somewhere like that for signing your own books?

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290559156182720512)

Once in a while, until I show the picture in the back. Never in a busy airport, though, where more authors visit.

## [Entry #14](./t-897/14)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (14 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/290934371827978240)

Back from tour for now. (Will go out again first week of Feb.) Time to dive into Part Two of Stormlight 2.

## [Entry #15](./t-897/15)

#### [Vanessa (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/wilde4fitness/status/294187875321401344)

Does the chasm on Sel have a counterpart in the cognitive realm?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294188557248131072)

Yes, it does. But moving around there is really tough . . .

## [Entry #16](./t-897/16)

#### [Vanessa (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/wilde4fitness/status/294188125708771328)

Are the Ghostbloods associated with Odium?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294190258680115201)

Odium has his fingers in a LOT of things.

## [Entry #17](./t-897/17)

#### [Michael M Lane (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Michael_M_Lane/status/294188530945622016)

Afternoon. What sorts of marketing have you found most effective for your books, Brandon?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294193318672359424)

When I was newer, it was visiting bookstores, giving free copies to their SF readers on staff.

#### [Brandon Sanderson](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294193452432887808)

These days, I'm honestly not sure. The momentum of it all has pretty much overwhelmed my individual efforts. :)

## [Entry #18](./t-897/18)

#### [Mali Medina (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/timpenin/status/294188884227678210)

@BrandSanderson, you took time out from the tour to celebrate a new arrival, yes? I hope everything went well and Congratulations!!!

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294196294048694272)

Yes, I did—but I haven't posted a lot about it online yet. Thanks!

## [Entry #19](./t-897/19)

#### [Matthew Miller (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/mathachew/status/294191093229187072)

Can we please, please, pretty please get the last Alcatraz book after Stormlight 2? Please? Rutabaga!

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294207289215311872)

I'll see what I can do. Rutabaga.

## [Entry #20](./t-897/20)

#### [John Leafback (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/Leafback/status/294191642393604097)

Should you have your pen name trademarked/copyrighted?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294208679870349312)

Some people think it is a good idea. I don't think it's needed, but it is not a bad choice either.

## [Entry #21](./t-897/21)

#### [Mike Cockrum (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/lamguin/status/294192166115360769)

How many shards has Hoid received powers from, whether taken, stolen, given, etc.?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210314591952896)

Well, he has a bead of Lerasium.

## [Entry #22](./t-897/22)

#### [Darrel (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/bakeranders/status/294192189083353088)

@BrandSanderson, can we expect to see Wit in his same duties to the king? Or perhaps just in other duties?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294210372578181120)

Wit is going to be around, for sure.

## [Entry #23](./t-897/23)

#### [John Doe (23 January 2013)](https://twitter.com/cobraspideyguy/status/294192522564100096)

What other stories/Project do you have working besides
*Steelheart*
,
*The Rithmatist*
,
*Unfettered*
,
*Dangerous Women*
, and Stormlight 2?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211474778378241)

Lol. As if I need more. Well,
*Alloy of Law*
sequel has some work done on it, as does a
*Legion*
sequel.

## [Entry #24](./t-897/24)

#### [Vanessa (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/wilde4fitness/status/294192567917084672)

If a live Elantran entered the pool outside of the city, could they also use it to travel to the cognitive realm?

#### [Brandon Sanderson (23 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/294211777049292801)

Let's just say that the characters in the book do not fully understand the pool or its power.

## [Entry #25](./t-897/25)

#### [Brandon Sanderson (28 January 2013)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/295977736613289984)

I recorded myself writing a chapter from the next Stormlight Archive book. This
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxFySrqdi8E&hd=1)
is the prewriting. More to come.
