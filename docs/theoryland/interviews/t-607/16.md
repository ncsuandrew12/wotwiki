# [Interview #607, Entry #16]: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#16)

#### Isabel

[Another thing](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=150616#poststop)
I will add in my report later.

I might have mentioned something to Brandon that I would be very upset if Nynaeve died.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He of course said that if she died it wasn't Brandon's fault. And I think he mentioned something that of course some people would die in the Last Battle.
