# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#1)

#### Isabel

Very small report: Pancakes and fries meet 2011

DISCLAIMER: I typed below report around 23.00 hours, when I was really tired and had a headache. As people might notice, my English deteriorates when I am mad or tired. All mistakes are mine. Next time I won't post a report so quickly, but try to make sure it's gramatically correct first (although that probably won't happen, but I can try).

Other dutchies will probably write a better report. I will keep editing and improving this one.
