# [Interview #607, Entry #3]: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#3)

#### Isabel

When Brandon arrived around 5 at the meeting spot, there were about 11 other dutchies who made it. Pretty big group. Especially when you get a warning less than three hours before the meet. It was on a working day.

The restaurant we were planning to go to was full. Someone of the group was so smart to call ahead.
So I actually guided all the people to find a restaurant were they had pancakes. We ended up in a restaurant near the Central Station (Blom).

It was really fun there. Just to hang out and talk. And Brandon found out that you don't put salt on your pancake (he took one with cheese and bacon) and he took some fries with mayonnaise.
