# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#2)

#### Isabel

Hey all,

I just had a great day today. This morning I signed for my house. So I officially own a house now (that will be built and hopefully ready in 2012).

After that I went to work and suddenly got a text by Dai Shan around 3.30 that Brandon was in Amsterdam. Brandon missed his flight to Oslo in Amsterdam, so he had time left.

So of course I did a little fangirl cheer and dropped everything I was doing at work and went to Amsterdam. Thankfully I didn't have a meet this afternoon at work. So I could actually do this.

I arrived in Amsterdam around 4, although we weren't supposed to meet up till 4.45. I walked to the dam square, but didn't see Brandon anywhere. I was thinking of heading to the ABC, but I thought if I went there I wouldn't make it on time. So I didn't. Afterwards I heard Brandon was there and signing books, so I should have done it. Apparently the ABC people were really nice and invited him over next time. I think they were even willing to pay for hotel and train in Europe?
