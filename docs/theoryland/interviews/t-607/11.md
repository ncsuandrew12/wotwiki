# [Interview #607, Entry #11]: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#11)

#### Isabel

During the meal I got text messages by Dai Shan, about how crappy it was that he was playing piano for ballet classes and couldn't be here.

YKS was also at work, but she was around 6.30 at central station and at that time Brandon needed to head back to the airport. So she went with us to get him there. It was really good to see Doris again.
