# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#7)

#### Ted Herman

How did Fain know the dagger was in the White Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That's because of course he senses it.

#### Isabel

It really felt like a duh question and looking backwards I should have asked more on range and stuff like that. The same with the range of him sensing Rand. Sorry, I failed a little bit as a Theorylander.
