# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#10)

#### Isabel

Oh yeah, about the release date [of
*A Memory of Light*
].

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon hopes to finish the book this year, but the release date depends on how fast the editing is going. Harriet wants to take six months to edit it. As everyone knows, last year was hell and went too quickly with editing.
