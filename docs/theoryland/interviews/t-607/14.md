# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#14)

#### Isabel

There were also other probably interesting questions, but I forgot. Sorry. Really tired now, going to sleep.

Before I forget: there were two people who made this meeting possible. One woman (I forgot her name) who picked up Brandon at the airport and Martijn(?) who gave Brandon a tour from three till 4.45 (and tweeted with him beforehand). Thanks for helping Brandon and tweeting with him.

Oh and I didn't take any notes, so let's wait and see what other people confirm. The sentences are how I remember it (and could be that some questions are already asked).
