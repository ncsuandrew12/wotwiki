# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#5)

#### Isabel

Another question I asked was about the structure of
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is perfectly clear, Brandon knows every scene, but he just has to write it.

The title
*A Memory of Light*
is still fitting for the book. I was wondering about it, because RJ origiinally wanted all in one book.
