# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#9)

#### Isabel

Oh yeah, I also asked about the
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
fight (that was actually during the walk to the restaurant) and if the Black Ajah shouldn't have been more blurred out. See discussion at
[Readandfindout.com](http://www.readandfindout.com/wheeloftime/messageboard/209917/)
.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He told me that someone sent him a theory about it. He was thinking if he would post that theory and tell what parts are wrong and right (if i remember correctly). Or he was thinking of keeping the answer a secret.

#### Footnote

The fight in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
took place in
*Towers of Midnight*
Chapters 37-38. This Q&A led to a
[Twitter conversation](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#146)
which cleared up the issue somewhat.
