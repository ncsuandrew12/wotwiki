# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#8)

#### Ted Herman

Why did the Seanchan attack Ghealdan?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I remember the answer correctly. The Seanchan attack places, because they wanna conquer the whole world and it's not smart to attack the Borderlanders.

#### Isabel

@Terez LOL, I forgot that the Seanchan haven't really launched a full scale attack on Ghealdan yet (in the current time). But it also could be that Brandon interpreted the question differently. The Seanchan did conquer Ghealdan in the vision of Aviendha.

I am not sure what WSB wanted with this question. However it didn't seem there was anything exciting there.

#### Footnote

Ted
[noted](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=150644#poststop)
that the question he intended to have asked was 'Why
*didn't*
the Seanchan attack Ghealdan?' He managed to ask that question
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=627#13)
