# [Interview #607: Pancakes and Fries with Brandon Sanderson - Isabel, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=607#4)

#### Isabel

Oh yeah, I first asked him some questions about the influence of the Dark One at Shayol Ghul. I first tried to ask about the influence of the Dark One around Shayol Ghul in the Age of Legends, but that really went nowhere. So I just asked about the current influence at Shayol Ghul.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The ceiling in the tunnel to the Bore is actually being lowered by the Dark One and he can actually close it. So it's not imaginary.

#### Footnote

The question is referring to the
[tunnel with the stalactites](http://www.theoryland.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=150610#poststop)
at Shayol Ghul.
