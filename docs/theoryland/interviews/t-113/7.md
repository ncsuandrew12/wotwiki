# [Interview #113: Brisbane Signing Report - Willum, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=113#7)

#### Robert Jordan

He listed his favourite seven authors (Joel Gilmore has all of them on his tape) but all I can remember at the moment are Twain and Dickens. RJ is a writeaholic when he gets going, and often skips lunch and writes all day. He enjoys writing in his garden, and this keeps him away from Harriet when he is in writing mode.
