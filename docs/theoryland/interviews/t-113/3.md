# [Interview #113: Brisbane Signing Report - Willum, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=113#3)

#### Robert Jordan

I asked about what happens to, and where the souls of the Forsaken go between being killed and resurrected by the Dark One, and RJ was evasive, saying that he wasn't going to go that deeply into the theology of the WoT with us (at the signing, or the whole series?). All he would say is that the transition from death to resurrection is almost instantaneous.

#### Footnote

See the note on Joel Gilmore's

of the same question.
