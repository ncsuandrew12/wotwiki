of their Bridge Four T-shirt contest that I talked about
[last week](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1059/Updates+Bridge-Four-Shirts)
. Designs #1 and #3B had the most votes, so both of those are now available for
[preorder](http://store.inkwing.com/)

There's also some Wheel of Time T-shirt news. Ta'veren Tees has a new

Also, March marks Ta'veren Tees' one-year anniversary, so they're having a customer-appreciation month. There's a monthlong clearance sale on several of their older tees, as well as a chance for people to win free shirts. Each Friday in March they'll make a Free Shirt Friday post on
[their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TaverenTees)
; "like" them on Facebook and comment on that post to be entered to win.
