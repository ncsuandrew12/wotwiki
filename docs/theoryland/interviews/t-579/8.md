#### Alex C. Telander

And what about the
*Alacatraz*
books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*Alcatraz*
books: the fourth one is coming out this month some time. The official date is like in December, but they always release early. And then that's the end of that contract, and I actually don't have time to write any more of those right now. They've been released at the same time, but again, these were books that were written before—one of them was written before, one of them was written in between Wheel of Time books—but I just don't have time for those right now. So, eventually I will pick up that series and finish. There's one more book I want to do.
