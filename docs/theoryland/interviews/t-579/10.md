# [Interview #579: BookBanter Interview, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=579#10)

#### Alex C. Telander

I recently did an interview with Dan Wells, and he confessed that you write your own RPG campaigns.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I do write my own RPG campaigns.

#### Alex C. Telander

Do you ever think you'll get publishing those at all?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I did it would be just a labor of love because they're so scatter-brained. Like, my notes for them are so scattered-brained that the amount of work it would take to get one actually in a shape where I could publish it would be so astronomical. I won't say no, but I'll say it's highly unlikely because this is something I do just to relax and have fun. It's mainly something I do every other week so that I have something scheduled that I spend time with my friends and my brother. You know, I sit down and have to schedule these things in my life these days. And it allows me to just be bizarre. Some of these things are pretty bizarre. You don't even want to hear what is happening in these campaigns.

#### Alex C. Telander

[laughs] I'm sure.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, maybe. For years I've wanted to do something that I don't see a lot in gaming, which is really self contained, one volume, kind of like we have one volume epic fantasies. One volume campaign, rules, story that only the DM has, or the GM has, and make learning the rules part of the fun of the exploring the world. Instead of having everyone read all these rule books ahead of time, and then sit down and play.

#### Alex C. Telander

Right. You kind of discover as you go.

#### Brandon Sanderson

You discover as you go, and you learn the rules as you go, and build an RPG that does it that way. Like, I usually start my campaigns with the characters with having no memory, they're blank slates. They all wake up and they discover a world, and even the mechanics of the world, as their players do, which is a very fun way to do it.
