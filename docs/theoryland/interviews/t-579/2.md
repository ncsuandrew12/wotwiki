#### Alex C. Telander

Welcome to Episode 38 of BookBanter. I'm your host, Alex C. Telander. [Paid advertisement not transcribed.]

And in this episode, which marks the two-year anniversary for BookBanter, we'll be having our first 'second interview' with an author already interviewed on the show, and that is best-selling author Brandon Sanderson. We'll start first with my review for his book,
*The Way of Kings*
, the first in a ten book new fantasy series. And then we'll have the interview with Brandon, done recently before one of his signings, which will be a short one due to him being now so popular and best selling that it was hard to get a long interview with him.

*The Way of Kings*

And now my interview with Brandon Sanderson.
