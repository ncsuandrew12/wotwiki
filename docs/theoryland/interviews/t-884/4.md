# [Interview #884: AMOL Signing Report - Kara, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=884#4)

#### Kara

I waited around with newly made friends after the first round of signings so that we could go back for the personalizations from Brandon (we had a very nice dinner together at the bistro there). I told Brandon that I had read and loved Patrick Rothfuss based on his recommendation and asked him for books that he loved to read. He was nice enough to write down a few names.
