# [Interview #884: AMOL Signing Report - Kara, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=884#2)

#### Kara

#### Brandon Sanderson

One funny story, the guy in front of me gets to the table and has the three WOT books that Brandon worked on, when Brandon opens
*The Gathering Storm*
, he says "Did you know you had
*Fires of Heaven*
in the Gathering Storm cover?" Brandon said he would not sign the bookâ€”I'm still not sure if the guy did that on purpose.
