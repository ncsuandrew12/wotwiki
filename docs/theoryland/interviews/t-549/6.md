# [Interview #549: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Luckers, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=549#6)

#### Luckers

You spoke
[during the signing tour](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#6)
of perhaps having some material of
[Pevara being awesome](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=458#1)
on your website—is that still on the table? If it is, would it be pre- or post-
*Towers of Midnight*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That suggestion came about because I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to fit it in. In the end I decided to get three or four chapters of it into
*Towers of Midnight*
. So it is there. I haven’t yet decided whether the rest of that story will happen on screen in
*A Memory of Light*
or whether it will have to happen off screen. The outline is all there, but I’m still not sure what I’ll have time for and what will work with the pacing.

Posting something on my website is not something that I could just do offhandedly. If I were going to do it it would take a lot of talking to Harriet and Tor and getting permission. So that was really only a long-shot contingency plan. Will it happen? I don’t know. We’ll have to see what gets into
*A Memory of Light*
. I’m pleased with
[the parts](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#21)
I was able to fit into
*Towers of Midnight*
, which means there’s a good chance I’ll be able to fit the rest into
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### Footnote

Some fans were very vocal in opposing the idea when it was first raised, and Harriet would probably have been reluctant to do it anyway. However, Brandon said he
[managed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=762#1)
to fit the rest into
*A Memory of Light*
.
