#### Luckers

Got any fun anecdotes from behind the scenes of Team Jordan for us?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Other than
[Butt Trollocs?](http://twitter.com/BrandonSandrson/status/21040716125)

Here's a typo from
*Towers of Midnight*
for you. I wrote: "Butt Trollocs are cowards at heart." Beta reader highlights and asks: A new tribe of Trollocs? :)

I don’t know. They’re fun people. Alan makes really really bad puns a lot of the time, which is quite amusing. Watching their commentary on the drafts as we’re passing them back and forth (and they’re writing out their thoughts and responding to each other’s thoughts) can be a hoot and can be frustrating at the same time.
