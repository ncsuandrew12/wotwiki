# [Interview #549, Entry #10]: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Luckers](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=549#10)

#### Luckers

Following that is probably a good time to ask: Were you scared by the rabid nature of the fans? We do be crazy.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I was very scared. Heh heh. For one thing, I was really scared that I would pronounce things wrong and get raked over the coals for that. I also knew how passionate people are about this—and they have a right to be—so I feared I would be vilified for my faults. Because I do have faults. I’ve been very up-front with people that I don’t consider myself as good a writer as Robert Jordan, particularly at the height of his writing abilities working on these books. And so that was a real concern for me. I talked about that last year on tour quite a bit, which anyone who saw my presentation about the books would remember. Screwing this up would mean hatred on huge levels from a large number of people. So I just took that as extra motivation to not screw it up. Or at least to screw it up less than any other person could have, since Robert Jordan was no longer here to do it right.
