# [Interview #549: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Luckers, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=549#11)

#### Luckers

What’s the funniest/oddest thing a fan has ever suggested to you, or asked you about the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There was a fan who came up to me completely seriously and said, “I know the secret. Don’t worry. I know it’s going to happen. I won’t tell people. I just want you to know that I know. I know that Mat is actually the Dragon Reborn and not Rand. I know this is going to come out in one of the next books, and everyone else will be surprised, but it’s all laid out right there, and here are the facts of why Mat is the Dragon Reborn.” And I blinked and said, “Oh, well, that’s an interesting hypothesis,” and then thought, I hope you’re not terribly disappointed when you find out you’ve been wrong all these years.

#### Footnote

This probably refers to Felix, whom Brandon met at a signing in the LA area at least once. Felix believes that Rand is a false Dragon, and that Mat is He Who Comes With the Dawn, and that he's going to have a threesome with Aviendha and Tuon. Or something.
