# [Interview #549: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Luckers, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=549#13)

#### Luckers

Will Verin face punishment from the Dark One for what she did? (Also, wow for that scene. Just plain flat out wow!)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, I canâ€™t claim very much credit for that scene.

Will Verin face punishment from the Dark One? It will all depend on whether he can get his mitts on her or not.
