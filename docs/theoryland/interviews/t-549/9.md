#### Luckers

Also, did Agelmar give Hurin a hug when he got back from meeting Rand?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, I don’t know if Shienarans are really hugging types. But Hurin seems like he might be the hugging type, so maybe.

#### Footnote

[Luckers comment: I can’t actually believe he answered this :D]
