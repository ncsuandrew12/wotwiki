# [Interview #549: Dragonmount Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Luckers, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=549#12)

#### Luckers

Cadsuane seems more than any other to be a character people either love or hate to great degrees, and I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on her as a character, and her role in the story?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The fact that people are so passionate about her means that Robert Jordan wrote her the right way.
