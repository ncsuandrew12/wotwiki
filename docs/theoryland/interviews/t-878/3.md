# [Interview #878: AMOL Signing Report - Austin Moore, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=878#3)

#### Austin Moore

#### Brandon Sanderson

A fan asked who Nakomi was from book 13. Of course, Brandon said RAFO but that there was a clue in
*A Memory of Light*
. When I heard this I thought of when Aviendha asked Bair about Nakomi and Bair said it was an old name so I asked Brandon if that was the clue when I was at the signing table and got a RAFO as well. However, he did say that she was in the book for a reason. She was not, and he emphasized it well, not in the series just to be theorized about.
