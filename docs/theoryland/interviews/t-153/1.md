# [Interview #153: COT Signing Report - Jeffrey Cummis, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=153#1)

#### Jeffrey Cummis

Even though they said he wouldn't do it because there were about 300+ people there and the fact that he talked for 15 minutes (Q&A), when I got up there, made a comment about the book, he smiled, asked what I was doing talking to his wife, told him getting the book signed, he flipped the page, laughed and said "Not that I am supposed to, but do you want your name in it like the way my wife wrote it?" I said, "No, you could put tsorovan'm'hael down?" He smiled, nodded, and did it, all in lower case to boot! I think he knows me from message boards, how scary is that!

That was me, front row. Anyway, that question about Moiraine was stupid, you had to know that was a RAFO. He did personalize mine, laughed at me about flirting with his wife, who was sitting next to me. He did remember me from
*The Path of Daggers*
book signing, so he quickly personalized this copy of
*Crossroads of Twilight*
for me. :D :lol Lucky me.
