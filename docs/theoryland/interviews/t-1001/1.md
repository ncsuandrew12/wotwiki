So who's at the Charleston Q&A and signing right now? Anybody?

We could have an impromptu meetup at the rotunda if anybody else is around.

Well, what did you ask?

#### nutsocharles

Second question, how did they feel now that it's done.

#### njm1314

I thought that you were there personally. No?

#### nutsocharles

I was. I was the second person up to ask a question at the panel at 3pm.

#### njm1314

Oh, thought you meant second question for the people that were there.

Well then what did they say?

#### Harriet McDougal

Collectively, that it was bittersweet. Brandon because he got to write the last three but it was over, Harriet that Robert's quest was completed. Probably a lot of the same things the readers were feeling, as we finally got the last book, but now there's no more books. Except the encyclopedia, which is around two years away.
