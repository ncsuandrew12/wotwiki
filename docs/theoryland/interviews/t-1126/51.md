# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #51](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#51)

#### Question

I’ve been watching some of the videos online and you say writing-- ideas are cheap, and they are, you can get ideas pretty easy, but how in the world do you get-- I can get the begining and figure out an end but how do you do get all the stuff in the middle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So if you’ve got your end, try and say what things, try to get a brainstorming session where you write with bullet points underneath it what things will help me earn this ending so that it feels-- that it has the emotion that I want. And try to brainstorm five or six things and make those waypoints along the way, if that makes sense, between-- Where it’s not just one point and two points, it’s five points, “I’m going to hit this one, this one, and this one” and if you can come up with four or five interesting things to happen through the end of your book that you can earn that way you’re going to have a sequence of like twenty touchstones that can each form a chapter or a couple of chapters that you can work on to get to that ending.
