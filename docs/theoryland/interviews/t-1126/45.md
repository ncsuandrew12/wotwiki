# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #45](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#45)

#### Question

Do you think any of your characters have been influenced by people you know in real life?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, it happens. It definitely does happen. Sarene, from Elantris is based on somebody. Most of Bridge Four is friends of mine, most of the lesser Bridge Four members. Not the main ones, but like Skar is a friend of mine, Drehy is a friend of mine, Peet is a friend of mine.

#### Question

So I was going to say-- What about, what’s his name?

#### Ben

Lopen?

#### Question

Yeah Lopen.

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, not the core group. Not Lopen or--

#### Ben

None of those guys.

#### Brandon Sanderson

But everyone else is like a cameo of my friends that I stuck in Bridge Four and, y’know, mutilate in horrible ways.
