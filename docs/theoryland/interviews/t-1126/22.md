#### Question

One of my favorite aspects of your books is you always have this character that kind of has a submissive personality starting out and they evolve into a more dominant personality. Do you have an author for a series that kind of inspired this?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Inspires me? He says frequently I have a character in a submissive position that becomes dominant through the course of the series. Do I have an author that I’m relying on specifically. No more than the Hero’s Journey, the general idea of the person growing and becoming master of their domain were once they were not. I don’t think I have a specific person I’m looking at for that. But it is a fun type of story to tell, just because of the way you can show progression with a character.
