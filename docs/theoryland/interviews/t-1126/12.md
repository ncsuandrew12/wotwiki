#### Question

If you were going to make Horneater stew here on Earth, how would you go about it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If I were going to make Horneater stew, on Earth, how would I go about it. It’s going to be a spicy seafood stew. When I think of Horneater stew I’m actually thinking of [Korean word(s?)] which is a Korean dish. Or [different Korean word] is what I mean. [The second one again] is a spicy-- spicy seafood-- basically whatever thing from the ocean-- I don’t eat things from the ocean usually-- but everything from the ocean they want to throw in there with some spices. They stir it up and give it to you and you fish in there and there are like crab claws and full clams in the shells. You’re like “Really guys?” But Rock would just be munching those down and being happy.
