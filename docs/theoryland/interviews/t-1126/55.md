#### Question

In the book [Way of Kings] you discuss that if you were to lose a piece of Shardplate you have to regrow the part back, or else someone takes it and tries to regrow the entire plate. One thing that has been bugging me for a while now is if you were to take a small piece of the armor, such as a glove, and fuel it with stormlight to regrow the whole armor, does it retain the original armor? Like does it retain how it looked before, the glove? So it just transfers over?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, and the original glove will disintegrate.
