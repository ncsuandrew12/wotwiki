#### Question

The first seven or eight Wheel of Time books had a sort of dictionary that was co-wrote with Jordan and I think Theresa Patterson..Do they plan on doing that…Are you going to have any input on that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They are doing a final-- a redo. It’s a more extensive encyclopedia written by Harriet, Robert Jordan’s wife. I had very little, not very much.
