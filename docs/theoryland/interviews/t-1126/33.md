# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #33](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#33)

#### Question

Have you thought of titles for the rest of the Stormlight Archive? Are they names of books in-world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I only named the first five when I was doing my outline. They were Stones Unhallowed, Oathbringer, and I don’t like the other name so I’m not going to mention it.
Yes, they are all names in-world.
