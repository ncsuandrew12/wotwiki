# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#3)

#### Question

In /The Reckoners/, was there a particular power that I gave to someone because I just thought that power was cool.

#### Brandon Sanderson

And yeah, the tensors. They can turn things to dust. For years I’d been walking around looking at our society where we have all this metal and this wood around, and things like that. I just loved the idea of just being able to turn it to dust. Maybe it’s like a “reducing things to their more primal state” or whatever-- but anyway it was one of those magics that was in my head for a while. And really superheros are magic. I don’t pretend that they’re science fiction, they’re magic. So I just designed these magics that feel cool to me.
