#### Question

What’s my writing process like now?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So I’m a writer. That means I don’t have to get up in the morning unless I have to come to some signing like this. I hope you guys appreciate the fact that I got up at 6:45 this morning. Normally I get up at noon. So I get up at noon, I write from noon to 5, I then go hangout with my family from 5 until 9 or so, and at about 9 o’clock I go back and I write from like 9 to 3. Or something like that. And I then I goof-off and go to bed at about 4. It is a great life. Except when I’m on tour and they are like “Yeah you need to be up for a flight at 8 o’clock” and I’m like “AHHHHH! Curse you Brandon and you staying up late all the other nights!”
