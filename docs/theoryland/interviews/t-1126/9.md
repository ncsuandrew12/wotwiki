#### Question

Do you find it hard working with multiple publishers and multiple houses?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Do I find it hard working with multiple publishers… and multiple houses as a writer? Uh, yes there are some hard parts to it. I do two tours a year instead of one, because I have two publishers now-- And that’s rough. Every time one publisher asks for something the other one is like “Well we want that to” so I'm going to BEA, that’s the Book Expo, and the other is like “Well you have to come to this thing for us”. So it fills my time a lot more, which is hard. But at the same time it is very nice because it gives me a little more credibility with both. That they both know that they kind of have to make me happy. That is pretty nice. And there is also the piece of mind that if for some reason one of things I was doing tanked I’ve always got another one. That was much more important to me early in my career, when I was doing the Alcatraz books with Scholastic and the epic fantasies with Tor.
