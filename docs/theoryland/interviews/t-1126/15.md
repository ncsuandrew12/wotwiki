#### Question

If characters are reflections of their authors, which character do you feel reflects you the most?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which character reflects me the most. I don’t think there is one… I think each of my characters represent me in some way and each character is different from me in other ways. So I can’t say which one represents me more or less. They’re all a bit of me.
