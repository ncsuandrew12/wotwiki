#### Question

What can you tell us about the Mistborn video game?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What can I tell you about the Mistborn video game. We are still working on the Mistborn video game. The same producer that has the rights but the developer that we were hoping to use has fallen through and they have moved on. This is the third time we’ve moved to a new developer. We do not plan for it to come out this year. We keep pushing it back. I’m sorry. But the good news is the movie seems to be kind of inching forward again finally, so if the movie gets made that will push the video game to come out And if a video game comes out that might push the movie to come out. So they are kind of intertwined and moving well together.
