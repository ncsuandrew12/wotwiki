#### Question

What is your favorite Aspect to write in /Legion/?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What is my favorite Aspect to write in /Legion/. It’s J.C. by a mile. \*laughter\* Can you guess who J.C. is based off of? ...J.C. is based off of the actor Adam Baldwin, from his various roles. He’s almost always played someone with the initials “J.C.” Go look it up. That’s Jayne from Firefly or from Chuck and things. I just think he is hilarious. In my head that is who would play J.C.
