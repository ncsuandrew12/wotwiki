# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#25)

#### Question

Do I consult with other fantasy authors? Or do we keep things to the vest?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We consult a lot. We talk to each other a great deal. The ones that I know best are the ones I often go to but sometimes-- I talk to Pat Rothfuss quite a bit, and Brent Weeks, were kind of in the same area but with three different publishers and that’s really useful to us. I consult with my Writing Excuses buddies all the time. Somebody who knows a ton that I don’t know very well but I know he knows a ton so I’ll often ask him question by email is Cory Doctorow. He just like knows everything. We talk a lot, whenever we can. Because it is a very solitary business, so having people to talk to about it is great.
