# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#23)

#### Question

I would want to know what is your favorite character you’ve ever written.

#### Brandon Sanderson

What is the favorite character I’ve ever written. I actually can’t pick one, because they are like my children and picking a favorite child is basically impossible. I don’t have one. Robert Jordan, I quote him a lot because I studied his life a lot, he always answered this question by saying “My favorite character is the one I’m working on right now” and I like that answer.
