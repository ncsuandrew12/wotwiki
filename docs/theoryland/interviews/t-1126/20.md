#### Brandon Sanderson

A good question, are spren molecules and atoms that rearrange in our mind to create things. No, they’re not. Spren are entities from the Cognitive Realm, who have gotten pulled through in Roshar. It is something that doesn’t exist on Earth, the Cognitive Realm, pulled through by human intervention. The way we think about things and personify things.
