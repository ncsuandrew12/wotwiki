#### Question

And are there established trade routes between Epic-controlled areas?
Are they patrolled by Epics?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.
Umm, yes to an extent. For the most part you know that if you hit an Epic’s trade caravan you’re all dead, y’know? So they don’t have to worry about it that much. But some are patrolled. Not by the Epics, but by their people.
