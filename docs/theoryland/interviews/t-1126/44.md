# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#44)

#### Question

I am playing a GURPS roleplay where my character is a lawyer and I’m in law school. And I was wondering if you have ever considered having a character in the books who is a lawyer?

#### Brandon Sanderson

An attorney? There is a story I’ve wanted to tell forever... I’ll never do it, though. But it's one of those ideas. I wanted to do a story where aliens come down and decide that throughout human history possession of land indicates ownership, by our historical record. We have to convince them in court that that's not the way we do things. They just want to annex the planet. "Look at the Americans. You just took this land and said it's yours. So we want to do that to your planet." And have a science fiction story that is a legal battle about why they can't take over our planet.

#### Footnote

reminds me a little of Year Zero
