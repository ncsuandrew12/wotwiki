#### Question

Are you still planning on doing /Mistborn/ in Space, because that would be awesome.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Am I still planning on doing /Mistborn/ in Space. Yes I am… /Mistborn/ was originally pitched to my editor-- I pitched it as a trilogy of trilogies--I’ve obviously gone off track on that on that--but I was going to do an epic fantasy, a 1980’s level kind of contemporary, and science fiction all in the same world. /Alloy of Law/, I really fell in love with that time period for some things I was doing and I was like “I’m going to write FOUR BOOKS HERE” So there’s now 13 planned. Who knows if I’ll add more and things like that.
