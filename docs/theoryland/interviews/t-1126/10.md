# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#10)

#### Question

Would you rather be a misting or a Twinborn, and then which power would you choose?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What powers would I have? ...I would probably pick Twinborn because “Hey extra power” right? I would probably have Wax’s powers from /Alloy of Law/, those are the ones I find the most interesting. Which is why I started with them there. I think I will be able to do cool things with them. Others are cool as well but-- With all this metal around, jumping on it would be so much fun.
