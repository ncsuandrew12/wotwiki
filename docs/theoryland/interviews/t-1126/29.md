# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #29](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#29)

#### Question

I had another question, did you ever read books by other authors to get your ideas?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes I read a lot of books by other authors and what I usually do is I will read something and if they did it well, I don’t want to do anything like it. But if I think they messed it up then I’m like “Oh I need to do a story that does this the right way” …It is one of the most fun parts of being a writer. You can watch a movie and go “Ah they totally did this the wrong way [...] and then do it yourself, the way you want it to be.
