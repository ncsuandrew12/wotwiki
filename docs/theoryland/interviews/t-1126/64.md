#### Question

When you write Hoid's story is it going to be like Ender's Shadow, with a new perspective on the same events?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I know that stuff, but I don't plan to do it that way. I plan to do his backstory more as his own story because while I really like Ender's Shadow, most of the things like that I haven't enjoyed as much. Plus, it would take me books and books and books to do it. We'll see. I haven't closed the door on that idea, but I'm not planning on it right now. There are parallel things like that I am planning to write, though--just not Hoid.
