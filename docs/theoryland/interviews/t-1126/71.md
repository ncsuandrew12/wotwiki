Can a seeker sense another allomancer if there is a coppercloud between the two (but both are outside)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. but he might get some interference.

#### Ben

Would they sense the cloud itself, like "Hey, there's a cloud between me and what I'm looking at"?

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you know what you're doing, you might be able to say something is interfering, but you wouldn't be able to determine what. There are multiple things that could cause that, for instance aluminum.[He started to say a few other things that might interfere, but cut himself off partway through words. If you think you might be able to decipher those almost-words, have at it. It's about 5 minutes from the end.)
