#### Question

What happened to Alcatraz?

#### Brandon Sanderson

What happened to Alcaraz. Well he almost got sacrificed to the dark powers by a cult of Evil Librarians but he survived to write his autobiography-- No, you mean the books. I wrote the fifth book this summer after researching for /The Aztlanian/ long enough that I realized I have to do more research before I can finish it. So I stopped, knew that I wanted to write another middle-grade, so I stopped and wrote /Alcatraz/ 5 and gave it to Tor. They’re planning to publish it next year. They’re going to start with /Alcatraz/ 1 in January with new art and things like that, publish those first five and do the sixth book sometime in June-- Or fifth book in June is what I think. So republish the first four and then publish the fifth.
