#### KalynaAnne

Various questions about The Rithmatist

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, 5 and 8 point defenses (constructed from applying the 9-point circle construction to right triangles and isosceles triangles respectively) could exist. They haven’t really been explored in world though.
You can always bind more than one thing to a bind point, but binding multiple things weakens the point. It is a much better idea to add a small circle that gets 3 additional bind points. It doesn’t change anything if the point comes from multiple points in the 9-point construction.
When I showed him the 9-point ellipses constructed from different triangle centers (see the constructions here ) he stared at them for a moment before answering. He hesitantly said that, yes, those constructions should be valid in theory, but that they shouldn’t be used in practice. The sides of ellipses are weak enough that if you expect to need to defend your sides you really should be using a circle.
Yes, Lines of Vigor behave like light waves.
Yes, this means that higher frequency waves are better for doing damage, lower frequency waves are better for transferring energy (and thus moving things).
Yes, Lines of Vigor follow the rule that the angle of incidence = angle of reflection when bouncing off Lines of Forbiddance.
LINES OF VIGOR ALSO REFRACT. I asked it in terms of whether they slightly change speed and direction when they move between materials like, say, concrete and asphalt. He said yes and that you also get the wavelength adjusting.
Another version:
So, 9-point circles are really important. You can get all the different point placements as special cases of the nine point circles

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uh-huh.

#### KalynaAnne

You can also get 5 point; is that valid Rithmatically?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, that would work.

#### KalynaAnne

And 8-point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

8-point they haven't done very much experimentation with.

#### Ben

But you could!

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, you could.

#### KalynaAnne

So when you have multiple points, that are like a point where there are multiple things, could you bind multiple things to that point?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um yes, and you can always bind multiple things to a point--

#### KalynaAnne

Oh you can always bind--

#### Ben

So you can bind a chalkling and a circle to the same point…

#### Brandon Sanderson

...but it's going to make it weaker, so you don’t usually want to do it. You are better off to just stick circle on and get multiple points off of that.

#### Ben

[...]

#### KalynaAnne

But if it had multiple ones, would that make it less bad to bind two?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No--

#### KalynaAnne

So it doesn’t--

#### Brandon Sanderson

It doesn't. Good question!

#### KalynaAnne

If you use different circle centers rather than the orthocenter, you cando 9-point conic constructions and make 9-point ellipses?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### KalynaAnne

Is that valid?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say yes, it could be valid.

#### Ben

Wasn't there a rule about ellipses being weak?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, they are a little less strong.

#### Ben

Because the long sides are weaker than the short sides.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, but this would work. There's not much reason to use it because the other is naturally-- has a stronger integrity than this, but you could theoretically do that. The defenses that make use of an ellipse make use of the strengths of an ellipse already. But yeah that would be possible

#### Ben

With an ellipse you are asking for your opponent to flank you and come at you from the sides. And then if he pushes your circle out you're in trouble.

#### KalynaAnne

Do Lines of Vigor behave like light waves?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### KalynaAnne

So a higher frequency means it’s better at penetrating, lower frequency transfers energy and moves stuff?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Ben

Nice, I didn't know that one.

#### KalynaAnne

So, when they bounce off Lines of Forbiddance, do they follow laws of reflection?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### Ben

They should always reflect at the same angle. Think of, like, a pool table.

#### KalynaAnne

If a line of vigor is moving from concrete onto asphalt...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### KalynaAnne

Is it changing--

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's going to act like light transferring to a new medium.

#### KalynaAnne

So it refracts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s going to-- Yeah, it's going to refract.

#### KalynaAnne

It changes speed as it moves?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yep. And you get a different wavelength, etc. as it transfers onto a new medium.
