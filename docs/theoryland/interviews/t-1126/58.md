# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#58)

#### Question

What’s the hardest power you’ve created to find a balance for?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hardest power to find a balance for? I’d say first is Wheel of Time, but I didn’t create that... Hardest to balance… They’ve all been fairly easy so far. My guess is that it will end up being Stormlight just because I am doing so many books in that world, and I'm not resetting characters as much as I am in Mistborn, that I'm going to have to be careful about power creep... That's an excellent question.
