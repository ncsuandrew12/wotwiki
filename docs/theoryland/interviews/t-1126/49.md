#### Question

Are going to do anything else in the world of the story "Dreamer" [from the Games Creatures Play horror anthology]?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Probably not. She [Charlaine Harris] wanted me to write a horror story, and I'd never written one before so I said, "All right, what is the most frightening thing I can think of?" The most frightening thing I could think of was the kids who play Xbox having power over real people’s lives, and that’s where that story came from.
