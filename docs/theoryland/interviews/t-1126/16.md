#### Question

Which book was the hardest to write?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Which book was the hardest to write. /A Memory of Light/, the last of /the Wheel of Time/ books by a LARGE margin is the hardest book I’ve ever written because the last /Wheel of Time/ book mixed with a lot of war scenes that--I don’t have the history in warfare that Robert Jordan did so all this stuff I had to do, there was a lot of research and a lot of going back and forth with Alan Romanczuk with Team Jordan. It was by far the hardest.
