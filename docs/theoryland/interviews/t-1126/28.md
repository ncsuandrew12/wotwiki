#### Question

Do you have kids?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Do I have kids? or pigs? ‘Cause I have both, the kids are the pigs. I have three young boys, they are 7, 5, and 2. They are too young to read my books. We spend time reading /Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus/, that’s a very good book, or /Supertato/, one of their favorites, about a potato who is a superhero. What do they think? I don’t think they really get it. They don’t understand, they’re like “Daddy is working on his book” and my son will be like “I’m going to write a book too!” And it’s like one picture on a page with one word “Hat” or something and he’ll be “I wrote one, why does it take you months, it took me an afternoon.” I hope that someday they will enjoy them and be able to come on tour with me and things like that. Excellent question.
