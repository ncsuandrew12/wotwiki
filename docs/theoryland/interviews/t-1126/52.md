#### Question

There’s a huge movement in the genre, almost away from heroic, truly good figures and it seems to me like a lot of your books are kind of, there is some darkness in them but you are holding really tight to the light… What do you think about the idea of the true heroic character and where they’re going?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think that people can be truly heroic and I’m happy that the genre has lots of room for different types of storytelling, but the books I’m most interested in are the ones that are people still trying to do what is right, and so that’s what I want to write about.
