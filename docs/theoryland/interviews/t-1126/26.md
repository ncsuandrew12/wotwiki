#### Question

So is there one book from college that you were forced to read that when you look back now was the best reading you’ve done?

#### Brandon Sanderson

One book that I was forced to read. That was the best reading-- Probably /Paradise Lost/. I now think that book is awesome but when I read it when I was younger I was like “Ahhh what is this aehhhh epic poetry noooooo”.
