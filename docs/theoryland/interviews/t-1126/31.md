# [Interview #1126: Barnes & Noble (Newnan), Entry #31](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1126#31)

#### Question

I was wondering if Sazed was based on any of your own explorations when you were developing your own path?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, definitely he is a part of me, but there are big things that are different from me as well. Really the big concept for him was “the Missionary for Every Religion” and that was a cool idea to me.
