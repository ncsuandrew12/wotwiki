#### Question

I was wondering if Sazed was based on any of your own explorations when you were developing your own path?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, definitely he is a part of me, but there are big things that are different from me as well. Really the big concept for him was “the Missionary for Every Religion” and that was a cool idea to me.
