#### ccstat

Shallan's drawings in WoK showed multiple cryptics. Were there other cryptics accompanying Pattern at that time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### ccstat

Did they approve of what Pattern's choices?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. The cryptics are much like what is happening with Lift, where there is more of a conscious effort on their part. As opposed to what is happening with Syl or Jasnah where there is hesitance. What the cryptics are driven to do is in part because of what a few of their members have been experimenting with.
