# [Interview #759: Theoryland: An Hour with Harriet McDougal Rigney, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=759#11)

#### Matt Hatch

What was it like to be a part of the burgeoning sff field through the 70s and 80s?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, I don't know that it was 'burgeoning' so much. It was just...it had
*been*
big; it was an established field, and it was fun.

#### Matt Hatch

What made it so fun?

#### Harriet McDougal

Writers are fun. Publishing is fun.

#### Matt Hatch

Did you take a particular interest in science fiction, or was it coincidental?

#### Harriet McDougal

No. When Ace came along, in fact, I thought, "Hmm. How 'bout this." Because I hadn't really done anything, and I looked at who I liked reading in the field—which I did—and the funny thing was, I mostly liked the women writers.

#### Matt Hatch

And did you find more female writers in sff?

#### Harriet McDougal

No, not so many. Judith Merril was there, a wonderful anthologizer. Anne McCaffrey had some early stuff out, but a lot of the guys still had women characters who...who made coffee, you know. They weren't very exciting. Well, I saw that on my own personal bookshelves, there were a number of people I liked, and I kind of, I guess with personal interest I sort of moseyed in from horror, just because I liked it.
