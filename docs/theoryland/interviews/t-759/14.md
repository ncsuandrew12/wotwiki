# [Interview #759, Entry #14]: Theoryland: An Hour with Harriet McDougal Rigney](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=759#14)

#### Matt Hatch

What did your parents think about your leaving for New York?

#### Harriet McDougal

Going to New York? You know, I don't know; they seemed okay with it. I think Daddy liked it cause he'd grown up in New York; he was essentially a New Yorker.

#### Matt Hatch

Where in New York did he grow up?

#### Harriet McDougal

Upper West Side. He was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which is—I still don't know, why are there "The Amboys"—I don't know where the name comes from. Anyway, he went to live with—he had an uncle, I believe it was; a great-uncle who had done very well for himself and lived down by Washington Square—and Daddy went to live with him during high school—he went to Trinity School, which still exists on the Upper West Side—and he then got an appointment to the Naval Academy. He told me he stayed in the Navy because he thought he owed the Navy an education, having gone there for free. So they seemed to think it was okay. Mother liked New York.

#### Matt Hatch

Did she? Did they come visit?

#### Harriet McDougal

Oh yeah. Not too often, but every time they did, she'd run into somebody she knew on the sidewalk. And Daddy loved the oyster bar in Grand Central; he'd been going to the oyster bar since he was a midshipman.
