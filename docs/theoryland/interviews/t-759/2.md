Yeah, it was hot! I had relatives all over the place, so there was a wonderful sense of extended family. There were many notions about what girls should and shouldn't do—that was not so hot—but that was very ingrained. I was a late-born child—my mother was forty-two when I was born—so her attitudes were those of an earlier generation. And mostly, I got along...it was a happy childhood.

#### Matt Hatch

What was it that girls could and couldn't do? What comes to mind when you think about that?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, it was more...I was raised to "marry well", meaning money. And actually not money nearly so much as land, and proper blue blood, which in this case meant Confederate...and not much idea at all of a woman making independent money, unless it was as an artist or a writer. But there were no jobs; you could be a secretary. Wonderful. But that was not what I was raised to do.

#### Matt Hatch

You said you had family, so siblings? How many siblings?

#### Harriet McDougal

I had one sibling, a full sister who was twenty years older than me, and she was the only one.

#### Matt Hatch

And she's since passed away?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, she has gone. And she was very good to me.

#### Matt Hatch

Yeah? What's your favorite memory of her?

#### Harriet McDougal

Oh gosh, a lot. I
*loved*
her Christmas presents. She lived in Chattanooga, not in Charleston; she married when I was three. She was just a nice,
*younger*
woman in my life, and with my mother being that much older, she was a friend.

#### Matt Hatch

So did you have any nieces and nephews through her?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, a niece and a nephew.

#### Matt Hatch

And they are still...

#### Harriet McDougal

No, the nephew's dead, and the niece lives outside of Charleston. She has two sons.
