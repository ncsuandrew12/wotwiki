# [Interview #759, Entry #20]: Theoryland: An Hour with Harriet McDougal Rigney](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=759#20)

#### Matt Hatch

Your chapter names are beautiful.

#### Harriet McDougal

Thank you.

#### Matt Hatch

Did Jim take an interest in them at all?

#### Harriet McDougal

Not really. He approved them all, and occasionally I'd come up dry, and he'd say, "I dunno." But I never did one without his looking at them.

#### Matt Hatch

Some of them have double and even triple meanings; Terez wants to know, did you always pick these out of the text, or did he sometimes go back and add extra layers of meaning?

#### Harriet McDougal

No, no he never did that. Titles came after everything was written.

#### Matt Hatch

Or are we just imagining these extra layers completely?

#### Harriet McDougal

Possible. I don't know which ones she's talking about.
