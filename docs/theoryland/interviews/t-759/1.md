# [Interview #759: Theoryland: An Hour with Harriet McDougal Rigney, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=759#1)

#### Matt Hatch

I'd like to thank Harriet McDougal Rigney for taking time during the most recent
[JordanCon](http://www.jordancon.org/)
in Atlanta to speak about her life with me and my wife. Also, I'd like to express my gratitude to those that helped craft the questions and worked to make this interview happen. You'll note that I ramble a bit, as I tend to be less comfortable with formal interviews (unless it involves interviewing authors about the Wheel of Time) and lean on the informal and conversational. Finally, as much as we tried, this transcript cannot convey how enjoyable it is to speak with Harriet; she is very warm, engaging and demonstrative as she speaks and has quite the knack for story telling.

Please sit back and enjoy an hour with Harriet.
