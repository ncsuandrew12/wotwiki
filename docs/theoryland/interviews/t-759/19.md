# [Interview #759: Theoryland: An Hour with Harriet McDougal Rigney, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=759#19)

#### Matt Hatch

Jim said he started missing you after the two of you were done touring for
*The Fallon Blood*
, and that's when you started dating. Was he more like Rand, or more like Mat? In other words, did he make a concentrated effort to charm you, or did you just fall into his lap?

#### Harriet McDougal

He wasn't like either of them; he was like Perrin. Well, he had huge shoulders and curly hair, and he had gone through—he was very gentle because he was so big. If there was ever trouble in a class he was in, in grammar school, the teacher always thought he must have done it because he was so big. So he took a lot of thought before he did things, and that's how he was like Perrin, in both of those ways. And very strong.

#### Matt Hatch

And do you think he wrote that into Perrin as we know him?

#### Harriet McDougal

I think he's all of them.

#### Matt Hatch

But that's the part of him that is Perrin.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, very gentle. And he
*did*
set out to charm me. He was...I remember a moment—well, he was nice to Will, who was a kid at the time, and I remember Will came running upstairs to me one day and—they'd been talking downstairs—and he said, "Ma, he wants to take me to the
*Star Trek*
movie. Can I go? Huh? Can I? Huh? Huh?" And I said, "Let me come downstairs with you," and I said, "Can I come too?"

#### Matt Hatch

Was he surprised when you asked? Or was he...

#### Harriet McDougal

Oh, I think he said... \*mimics pumping her arm in the air\* (laughter) If you've ever dated a woman with a child, the first thing you do is get the kid on your side. At the time, I was furnishing a doll's house I had had as a child; it had never gotten properly furnished—and this was really important psychic work I was doing, I guess—and I remember he brought a present to me, and I've forgotten whether it was on Christmas or my birthday—and I was sitting at the dinner table, and he was standing over this small box, and I start to open it, and I realized he was going \*heavy breathing noises\* because he was so anxious, breathing, would I like it? And it was a really beautiful doll's house dinner table. He spent fifty dollars or something that he really didn't have. But it was that breathing..."Will she like it? Ohhhh..."

#### Matt Hatch

Was this when you were still dating?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah.

#### Matt Hatch

And obviously you liked it.

#### Harriet McDougal

Yes, yes! I liked his caring so much. That's what really got me. I didn't care about the doggone table, that wasn't the point.
