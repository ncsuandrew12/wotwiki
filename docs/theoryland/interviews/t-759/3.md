# [Interview #759: Theoryland: An Hour with Harriet McDougal Rigney, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=759#3)

#### Matt Hatch

So you still have family [in Charleston]?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, and I've got cousins you wouldn't believe.

#### Matt Hatch

From the quantity of cousins?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, yeah...and very nice. I love them.

#### Matt Hatch

A lot still live in Charleston?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah.

#### Matt Hatch

Do you have family events?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well we see them at Thanksgiving, Christmas—funerals these days—and also a lot of them, one main group are members of a very peculiar and politically not very correct—actually, it's getting more correct all the time—organization called the
[Society for the Preservation of Negro Spirituals](http://northbysouth.kenyon.edu/2002/Music/Pages/preservationspirituals.htm)
, which is gaining considerably more attention as a very legitimate preservation society of a very important folk song ethic, and I love to sing the things.

#### Matt Hatch

Oh really?

#### Harriet McDougal

Yeah, and there are now what are called rehearsals, and they used to have a once-a-year concert which was so peculiar. People dressed up like Miss Ann and Mr. Charlie, you know, in ball dresses, and we'd sit on the stage pretending to sing like African Americans, but not blackface—I don't mean that—but doing a thing called "shouting and lining", which is a traditional way of singing, and the whole point of the one concert was to raise money to buy the booze and the potato chips for the rehearsals throughout the year, which were once-a-month sing-alongs at people's houses, and when I was a little girl I'd hear these voices coming up the staircase. I loved the music from then on.

#### Matt Hatch

So music was always a part of your life?

#### Harriet McDougal

In that way—singing.

#### Matt Hatch

And do you still sing?

#### Harriet McDougal

Only in the back of the Spiritual Society. I sing in church on Sunday. It's not anything people would ever really,
*really*
want to listen to, but I love to do it.

#### Matt Hatch

I grew up in a very...my parents were singers, so I grew up around...

#### Harriet McDougal

Oh, so they were
*good*
?

#### Matt Hatch

(laughs) They were very good. Well I mean, you can imagine...we had those kinds of moments where everyone...you'd hear that. I mean, you'd hear singing all the time, and they wanted us to sing; singing was very much a part of my upbringing.
