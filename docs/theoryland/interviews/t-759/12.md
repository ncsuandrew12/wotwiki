#### Matt Hatch

When you heard about Jim from the bookshop owner, what was it about him that made you want to leave your contact information for him on an index card?

The bookshop owner said he was working on a bodice-ripper, that's what.

#### Matt Hatch

Why the bodice-ripper though?

#### Harriet McDougal

Well, they were huge at the time. And he apparently

said that to her, but he wasn't. (laughter) He just thought, "Oh gosh, Kathleen Woodiwiss got a million dollar bonus; I think I'll try one of those." That's what was going on in his head, and he said, "Yeah, I'm working on one of those," is what came out of his mouth! (laughter)
