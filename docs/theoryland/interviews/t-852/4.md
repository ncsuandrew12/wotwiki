Finally, a summary of some recent Wheel of Time news. The book comes out January 8th, but Dragonmount's Jason Denzel has read it and has written a response to the book in the form of
[a letter to Robert Jordan](http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php/News/amol/dear-robert-jordan)
. (There are no spoilers.) Also, as has been done in years past, the prologue has been released as an ebook. It's available from Tor in
[this list of countries](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/09/qby-grace-and-banners-fallenq-now-available-in-select-non-us-markets)
, and the
[UK publisher Orbit](http://www.orbitbooks.net/2012/09/24/a-memory-of-light-prologue-by-grace-and-banners-fallen-available-2-october-2012/)
will release it in the other countries next week.

I'm still not a fan of charging people multiple times for the same content, but a prologue ebook has been established practice for the Wheel of Time for over a decade, and many readers feel the length of the prologue makes it worth the money. Still, this is something that's really only for the hardcore fans who just can't wait any longer. Most people will wait and that's perfectly okay. There will be free previews too; the first scene of the prologue is available
[here](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/04/a-memory-of-light-prologue-excerpt)
, and there are excerpts from
[chapter one](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/07/read-an-excerpt-from-chapter-one-of-a-memory-of-light)
and
[chapter eleven](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/09/a-memory-of-light-chapter-11-excerpt)
. Tor.com will release the whole first chapter sometime in the next few months, followed probably by an audiobook preview of chapter two. The wait is almost over, folks!
