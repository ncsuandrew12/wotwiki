# [Interview #852: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: THE RITHMATIST Cover Art + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=852#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I sent out a newsletter over the last couple of weeks, which you can see
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/112/Brandon-Sanderson-Newsletter-for-September-2012)
. If you want to be on the mailing list (I send maybe three or four of these per year), sign up
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/contact/?topic=9)
. And if you want me to email you when I'm signing near where you live, be sure to tell me your city.

One of the things I mentioned in the newsletter is that my young adult book
*The Rithmatist*
is coming out next year. You may remember that I finished the first draft of this book (formerly known as
*Scribbler*
) way back in
[April 2007](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/category/33?page=3)
. Due to being a bit busy over the past five years I was never able to revise it to my satisfaction, but I've now had the chance, and Tor Teen will be releasing it next summer.

It's a fantasy/steampunk/mystery about a boy who gets free tuition to a magic school because his mom is the cleaning ladyâ€”yet he has no magical talents himself. I'll post more on it as next summer approaches.

Tor.com has posted the cover art, and my editor Susan Chang gives her thoughts about the book

. Look forward to it!
