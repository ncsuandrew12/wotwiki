#### Brandon Sanderson

While I was in Los Angeles during
*The Gathering Storm*
tour, I sat down for an interview with the folks from
[Mythmaker Films](http://www.mythmakersent.com/)
. Yesterday they posted an
[18-minute film](http://vimeo.com/9109667)
that includes footage from that interview as well as from my Los Angeles signing. If you're interested in how I got started writing and how I became involved in completing
*A Memory of Light*
,
[check out the video](http://vimeo.com/9109667)
.
