#### Brandon Sanderson

Finally, in the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations, I have a discussion of
[Vin's interactions with Ruin while imprisoned](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/326/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fifty-Seven)
and the first of a three-part annotation on
[Spook's climactic chapter](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/327/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Fifty-Eight)
.
