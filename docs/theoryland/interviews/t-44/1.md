#### Julie Kangas

Here's my snippet from the Santa Monica signing...

While inching down the 405 to Santa Monica, I passed a car with the licensce plate MRDRAGN. The driver was short with dark hair, so I
*snort*
ed and thought 'just another
*false*
dragon.'

I arrived early and was number 3 in line. I spent about an hour chatting with Robert Jordan before the signing.

Ok, ok, he was just some guy with the same name. :) I told him he should get access to this group so he could yank everyone's chains. It was funny to watch him get a book signed 'to Robert Jordan from Robert Jordan.'
