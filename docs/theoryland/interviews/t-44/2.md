# [Interview #44: LOC Signing Report - Julie Kangas, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=44#2)

#### Robert Jordan

The real Robert Jordan was late arriving (he had an earlier signing and then an interview) and asked for a three book limit. I had six books so got to talk to him twice.
He looked kind of tired and seemed to be in a hurry to get to everyone. Most of my questions got a 'read and find out.' He said he had read the 'Is Bela a Darkfriend?' thread from this group. He shook his head in a bemused manner as he said this.
