# [Interview #745, Entry #2]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Moiraine vs. Kelsier, Gen Con Indy, Interview + Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=745#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's episode of Writing Excuses features Mary, Howard, and I talking about
[Man vs. Nature](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/03/25/writing-excuses-7-13-man-vs-nature/)
. If you're as confused about that as Howard was, it's one of the basic narrative conflict archetypes (along with Man vs. Man and Man vs. Self). Check it out.

There's also a new
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
annotation up. This one covers
[chapter six](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/450/Alcatraz-Chapter-Six)
.
