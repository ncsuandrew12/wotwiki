# [Interview #934: AMOL Signing Report - Aegon, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=934#3)

#### Aegon

\*vague spoiler warning\*

An audience member had,
[years ago](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=180#6)
, asked RJ what would happen if an Aes Sedai balefired herself through a gateway, and was told by RJ that she should find a man, a woman, or a dog to love and she should get a life. (heavily paraphrased). The same audience member was present at the signing and asked if the scenario played out in
*A Memory of Light*
was done in response to her question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

BS said that he has avoided gateways and balefire in his series because that type of magic belonged to The Wheel of Time, but he himself has had many thoughts on the use of balefire and gateways. So no, the scenes from
*A Memory of Light*
were not a response to her, but BS's own story. The audience member also added that she did find a guy to love, had a daughter, named her Aviendha, and the crowd clapped.
