I remembered some more stuff in the shower this morning.

Someone asked who killed Asmodean. Groan. The answer was, of course, in the appendix [glossary] of
*Towers of Midnight*
.

In the interim since showering, I forgot the other thing I remembered. But it was of similar consequence as the Asmodean question. If I knew that I'd be sharing answers then I surely would have taken notes.
