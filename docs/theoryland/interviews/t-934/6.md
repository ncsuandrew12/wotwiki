# [Interview #934: AMOL Signing Report - Aegon, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=934#6)

#### Aegon

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I feel like somebody asked who summoned Slayer to the Blight. I could be mixing memories with
[Freelancer's great post @7](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/02/a-memory-of-light-tour-report-open-thread#321133)
, but I have a strange feeling that someone asked, and presented a case that it was Lanfear for similar reasons as provided above, and was told by BS that they make a good case and can defend their reasoning with confidence. I honestly don't know if I'm conflating memories, so please take this with a grain of salt.

#### Aegon

Furthermore, the above question doesn't make sense given that the audience was instructed not to spoil
*A Memory of Light*
, and to save questions related to
*A Memory of Light*
for the personal signings, which I wasn't able to attend or eavesdrop.
