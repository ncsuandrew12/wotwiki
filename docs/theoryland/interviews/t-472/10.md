# [Interview #472: TGS Signing Report - Aubree Pham, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#10)

#### Aubree Pham

From dinner re: balefire philosophy:

Talked to Brandon at the Stormleader dinner last night. He had a few things to say on this topic:

#### Brandon Sanderson

1. The bruises on Min's neck were not an error. After consulting with Team Jordan, it was determined that indirect effects remain. Rand was the one who strangled Min, not Semirhage directly, so the bruises stayed.

2. Brandon knows of two ways to destroy
*cuendillar*
. But he would not confirm if the Domination Band that Rand was wearing was made from
*cuendillar*
. He said it was not relevant to what happened.

3. The bracelets did not disappear when Semirhage and Elza were balefired because they were not considered to be intrinsic to their person. It would be the same if someone was holding a book and was balefired, the book would drop to the floor.

#### Footnote

Moghedien said the Domination Band was a form of
*cuendillar*
, and the assumption is that Rand was able to destroy it because he used the True Power.
