#### Question

What was the most difficult part of writing
*The Gathering Storm*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Keeping track of everyone, due to the exhaustive detail of the books. Brandon used
[Encyclopaedia WoT](http://www.encyclopaedia-wot.org/)
often. It was also difficult to make the character 'voices' correct. Aviendha and Tuon were the most difficult of these, because they are from different cultures.
