# [Interview #472: TGS Signing Report - Aubree Pham, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#5)

#### Question

Does RJ work out things like conservation laws, since he was a physicist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

From what I've seen, he considered it, the power that is doing all these things is coming from somewhere. They discovered the Dark One by finding the power (True Power). (They are) not aware of the source of the One Power. The Law of Conservation of Energy works, it's coming from somewhere, we're not sure where. It's not something the characters were considering, so it wasn't appropriate to include in the books.
