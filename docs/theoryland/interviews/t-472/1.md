# [Interview #472: TGS Signing Report - Aubree Pham, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#1)

#### Aubree Pham

After the signing, Harriet retired to the hotel, and the Storm Leaders went with Brandon to Cantina Laredo (Thanks Tor!). We talked a lot about balefire philosophy, and Brandon said he always wanted to know what would happen if you 'shot yourself in the foot' with balefire.

He also spoke about some of his ideas for other books. One that he plans to write after the Wheel of Time is finished is about a world where super powers are transferred by disease and terrorists use penicillin as a weapon.

We also talked about a lot of topics that would be spoilers for
*The Gathering Storm*
, so you can find them on Dragonmount's spoiler forum under 'signing questions & answers'. Below, I've included the Q&A that happened at the bookstore:
