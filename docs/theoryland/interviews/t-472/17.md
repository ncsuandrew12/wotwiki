# [Interview #472: TGS Signing Report - Aubree Pham, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=472#17)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Regarding Mesaana's alter ego: Brandon said that he had been sent a reliable quote from a Jordan interview that she wasn't anyone we had seen 'on screen' as of
*Knife of Dreams*
(? he may have said
*Crossroads of Twilight*
? I need to find the quote). Specifically, he said that Laras has been around since
*New Spring*
. And would not say if Mesaana was 'on screen' as her alter ego in
*The Gathering Storm*
, because he doesn't want to limit good discussion.

#### Footnote

Brandon clarified this
[later](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#1)
; a fan had led him astray.
