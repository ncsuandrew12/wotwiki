# [Interview #42, Entry #2]: LOC Signing Report - Justin Howell](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=42#2)

#### Justin Howell

Where did Artur Hawkwing start out? (IIRC, John Novak suggested this question in a post after the Chicago signing).

#### Robert Jordan

Answer: None, but he said that one could figure it out given a careful reading of the books. Sounds like Tear to me (as Mr. Novak predicted).

#### Footnote

It was revealed in the BWB that Hawkwing is from Shandalle, which was located in the region that now covers eastern Andor.
