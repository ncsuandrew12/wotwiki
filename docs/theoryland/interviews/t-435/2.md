*The Gathering Storm*
â€”need an epic fantasy to tide you over?) joins us to discuss
[how to avoid making your characters sound just like you](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/09/13/writing-excuses-season-3-episode-16-the-anti-mary-sue-episode/)
. We also put up an
[acceptance speech](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2009/09/13/writing-excuses-parsec-award-acceptance-speech/)
for the
[Parsec Award](http://parsecawards.com/)

[Clubs' backstory](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/286/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Twenty-Three)
