## [Entry #1](./t-1130/1)

#### Ruro272

Will we see all of the Heralds doing things in the upcoming books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The back five books are all about the Heralds. Two of them claim to be Heralds..... Two of the point-of-views will be Heralds.

#### Footnote

This fits well with what I've read from this site; specifically Taln and Ash are the Herald POVs in the back five according to other WoB. The interesting tidbit here is that "two of them claim to be Heralds" with the implied "but...." in his tone.

## [Entry #2](./t-1130/2)

#### Ruro272

Any hint on how Nin got a hold of Nightblood, or how Vasher lost Nightblood?

#### Brandon Sanderson

"Vasher and Nightblood had something of a falling out..."

#### Footnote

This is a direct quote since it is written in my book. Not all that interesting, but I think the important implication here is that Nightblood was not "stolen" without Vasher's knowledge, they had a "falling out". Obviously this doesn't answer a lot but I think it does put to rest the possibility that somebody came up and stole Nightblood out of nowhere. From other WoB we know that Vasher "misses and feels responsible for Nightblood" so obviously he's gotten over it since then.

## [Entry #3](./t-1130/3)

#### Ruro272

Does Harmony have any Splinters?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Do you mean like in his fingers? (Brandon has a coy smile. Kid looks at him like "you know what I mean you fool". Brandon laughs.) No, he does not have Splinters right now. Good question.

## [Entry #4](./t-1130/4)

#### Ruro272

Is there a reason why shadows go toward the light in Shadesmar, or is it just worldbuilding flavor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is a reason, but its not super important. It's like a cultural thing, things have reasons but they aren't always super relevant to the story. It's like safehands--do you know how safehands came to be? It's a cultural thing but it came from somewhere. This is something you probably won't read in the books but I can tell you. The idea of the safehand has to do with one-handed arts being feminine but two handed are masculine, and it all started after the Knights Radiant cast down their Shardblades. There was a huge power grab for these weapons and people quickly realized that the differences between men and women didn't matter when they had power armor, so the idea of one-handed arts being feminine and the safehand arose from that over many years of cultural evolution.

#### Footnote

Obviously this is very much paraphrased since it was a long answer and my notes and memory are not perfect, but I think I captured the important points without adding any of my own thoughts. Interesting that the safehands arose from the power grab after the Recreance as a way to maintain the division between men and women.

## [Entry #5](./t-1130/5)

#### Ruro272

Is there a separate "Shadesmar" (cognitive realm) for each planet or is it one big place that are all connected with different regions for each planet.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's one big place with different sections.

#### Ruro272

So since its one big place, could spren travel to a different section that correlates with a different planet, such as the cognitive segment for Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They could do there, but they wouldn't usually...

#### Ruro272

Is that because Honor's influence is only on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Brandon gave sort of a noncommittal half nod, but looked doubtful himself. Maybe best to interpret this last answer as a RAFO rather than reading into it too much.)

#### Footnote

Brandon didn't say a lot about this, and unfortunately I don't remember his exact wording, but it was clear that spren could technically go to different regions within Shadesmar that correlate to different worlds, but for some reason they don't or won't. My guess would be simply because only on Roshar to the ideas of men give them power, and if they deviate away too far they lose that connection that makes them exist. Just a thought tho.

## [Entry #6](./t-1130/6)

#### Ruro272

On a similar note, since Elsecallers can physically go to Shadesmar and have access to Transportation surge, can all Elsecallers worldhop?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, that is one of the Elsecaller powers.

#### Footnote

The most interesting thing about this is that, depending on the number of people in the Elsecaller order, there may have been quite a few Worldhoppers from Roshar throughout history. i'm surprised they weren't more Cosmere-aware if that was the case, but maybe they always just stuck around Roshar? I wonder how many Elsecallers are on other planets....

## [Entry #7](./t-1130/7)

#### Ruro272

In hindsight this seems like a really obvious question now (laugh), but I think it's really interesting that Elsecallers can travel to other planets too--we didn't know that before.

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are hints in the names on the map of Shadesmar.

#### Footnote

Since getting this answer I found out a few more things about this on the 17th Shard. It looks like previous WoB confirmed that there are hints in the names of things on Shadesmar somewhat related to Worldhopping, and we also know that the Expanse of the Densities is a planet that we already know. He could be alluding to those tidbits with this answer, who knows.

## [Entry #8](./t-1130/8)

#### Ruro272

Does Hoid have a Hemalurgically charged Nicrosil spike?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's... unlikely. Hoid would not want to open himself to the influence of Shards so using Hemalurgy on himself is unlikely. Although Hemalurgy is the easiest way to get other powers, he'd more likely do things the hard way.

#### Question

Alright, but would Nicrosil be the right metal to make a Hemalurgic spike if you did want to steal powers from another world?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's a good theory, you're theorizing well.

## [Entry #9](./t-1130/9)

#### Ruro272

Is Roshar, or has Roshar always been the only large landmass on the planet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Roshar is.... (Brandon then pauses and looks up, thinking very hard) Roshar has always been the largest landmass--as long as there has been land. (This statement was met with a LOT of OOOOHS, and Brandon had a definite grin on his face).

#### Footnote

Now this one is extremely interesting. If any of you guys have followed the discussions regarding the "Hints on the Roshar map" that Brandon's alluded to many times, the 17th Shard finally cracked the code that the landmass is a 2d cross section of a 3d shadow of a 4d Juliet transformation something or other blah blah, some crazy math thing. There is a whole thread about this topic somewhere on this forum, and the similarities are striking--plus Peter himself commented on that thread "About time you guys figured this out". So what does it mean that the shape comes from some complex mathematical methodology and not just random? Well, because somebody in that thread commented that they thought Roshar was created from leftover crem from highstorms over the course of thousands of years. Based on what we know about Roshar's shape, the fact that Brandon has commented on needing a system in which "earth" is deposited from the air, and the strong implication that there was a time when Roshar had no landmass at all, I think I'm definitely on board with the "Roshar = crem" theory.

## [Entry #10](./t-1130/10)

#### Ruro272

Was Adolin's murder of Sadeas him falling under the influence of Odium, or was that all him?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That was all Adolin.
