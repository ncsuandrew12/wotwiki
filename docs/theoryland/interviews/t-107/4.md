#### Raf Kaplan

I personally didn't think (idiot me) to ask any questions regarding specific events. But at the first signing I was in a hurry, and at the second one me and a friend held up the line for a few minutes because RJ talked to us in answer to my friend's question about pronunciation and names and I joined in, and we had a fun chat about how the WoT was meant to be read out loud until RJ realised how long the line was and quickly signed our books and let us go. Giving me no chance to ask extra questions.

And I couldn't even hang around, because I had to go fairly soon anyway.
