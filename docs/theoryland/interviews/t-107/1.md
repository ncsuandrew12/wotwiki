# [Interview #107: Melbourne Film Festival - Raf Kaplan, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=107#1)

#### Raf Kaplan

Anyway, I can't add much, but I'll add what I can. I attended the 'spotlight on Robert Jordan' interview and book signing, and then the reading (from
*The Path of Daggers*
and
*The Dragon Reborn*
) and the second book signing afterwards, but I missed the third session RJ was at.

#### Robert Jordan

Firstly, RJ said three more books "at least" and that he'd try to do it in three if he could, but he couldn't promise it would be only three. And he said he thought it would take "at least five years".

I won't repeat the stuff about sources Mark mentioned, although it took up most of RJ's responses to questions (and indeed, the interview) at the 'Spotlight' session.
