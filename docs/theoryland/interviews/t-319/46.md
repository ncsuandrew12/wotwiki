# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #46](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#46)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (Mat Cauthon)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-mat.htm)

The person said something along the lines of: "My wife thinks Perrin is the sexiest man alive."

RJ responded by saying that he, himself, found Perrin kind of boring, and he didn't understand why people liked him so much. But what really surprised him was that the most popular guy was Mat, the guy he had thought would be the most hated.

RJ then went into a minute-long tirade about how nice guys never get girls. He said that, while the girl might think she wants the good guy, she will always end up driving off with the guy in the Harley.
Yes, he said Harley.
