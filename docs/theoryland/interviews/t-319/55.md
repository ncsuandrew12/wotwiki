# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#55)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (Theology)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-theo.htm)

This one was asking about the lack of churches in Randland. They apparently have religious beliefs and such, so why aren't they there?

#### Robert Jordan

Churches and other places of worship are for people to connect with and reaffirm the presence of God (or whatever). The people of Randland see signs of their Creator every day through the One Power. If common people today could walk around performing miracles at will, we wouldn't have as much of a need for that confirmation either.
