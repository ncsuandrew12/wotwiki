FAQ: Who killed Asmodean?

#### Robert Jordan

Should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer. [yeah, uh huh...] Ok, we know that. But he also said that we should know based on where everyone was, what they were thinking, what they were doing. Duh, right? But he made a point of mentioning where. For people thinking it was a Traveller, would 'where' be important? Dunno...

His list of candidates included the Aes Sedai, Nynaeve, Aviendha, Bela, and God knows who else.

And you know why he won't tell us? Because he likes to see us SQUIRM. He said it in a friendly voice, but you could tell he meant it.
