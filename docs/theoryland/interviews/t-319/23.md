#### [Question (What else is in the Wheel of Time universe?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-morewot.htm)

After the Last Battle, will you write any more books in the WoT world?

#### Robert Jordan

No. No more in this universe. There will probably be some parallel stories in other fantasy series he’ll be writing, but no, no WoT books. [HOWEVER… He made a point of saying here (and in other places) that it was not NEVER, because “when you say never, you sometimes end up having to eat it”]
