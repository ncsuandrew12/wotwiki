#### [Signing ReportÂ (Moiraine Damodred)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-moir.htm)

Ok, I got my book signed in Vroman's in Pasadena, CA, today. RJ was extremely friendly, and talked to everyone, laughing and even teasing a bit. One could say he was "jolly".

Anyway, when it was my turn, I asked him two questions. I'll put parts in quotes when they are exactly what was said (or close enough), and I wrote it down so I'd remember.

As he signed my first book, I asked, "Is Cyndane's power roughly equal to, say... Moiraine?"

#### Robert Jordan

He had a surprised look on his face for a moment, then it became amused, and he gave me a RAFO. His face indicated to me that I was absolutely right, but obviously it's not evidence.
