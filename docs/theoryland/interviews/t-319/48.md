# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #48](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#48)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (Padan Fain)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-fain.htm)

(Didn't catch the question exactly, but it regarded Fain's escape and the dead prisoners.)

#### Robert Jordan

Fain killed the prisoners, not his rescuer. And it wasn't Lanfear.

#### Footnote

RJ later
[confirmed](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=188#11)
that it was Ingtar who rescued Fain from the dungeon in Fal Dara.
