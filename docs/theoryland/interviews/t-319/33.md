[Regarding the flow of time in books]

#### Robert Jordan

Books 1 through 9 cover (very roughly) about four years [made a point of roughly, as I doubt even he could whip out a precise answer on the spot]
Most of the books overlap with each other. Some of the events in early
*Winter's Heart*
, for example, overlap with late
*The Path of Daggers*
.
