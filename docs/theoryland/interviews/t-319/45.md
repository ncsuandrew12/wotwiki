Tonight I asked him, sneakily and in-between two people asking him to sign their books, about whether or not anything was still remaining from Lews Therin's palace, in other words if there were still ruins left of it in the current world.

#### Robert Jordan

Sadly, he answered a very clear "No, nothing is left of that anymore."

#### REPORTER

This means that the ruins underneath the Panarch's palace in Tanchico are not the ruins of Lews Therin's palace.
