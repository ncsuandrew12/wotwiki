#### [Signing ReportÂ (What books does Jordan read?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-read.htm)

On my second pass through, I asked him to name some favorite science fiction writers, since he always listed fantasy writers.

#### Robert Jordan

He answered John M. Ford (again), Greg Bear, and C.S. Friedman (again), who also has written a lot of good science fiction.

He actually reads a lot less science fiction, because he doesn't like distopias all that much. He likes technology. Why would people have to die at age 30 in the mud in some miserable hovel when they could live so much longer, do so much more.

Especially since it wasn't that long ago that people in American did die at the average age of 30. You just had to go back a few hundred years.
