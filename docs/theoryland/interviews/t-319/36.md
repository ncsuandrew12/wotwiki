When a soul is reborn, at what point does it enter the body?

#### Robert Jordan

Hmm… \*think, think\* I’d have to say as a fetus. When the body becomes capable of sustaining life.

#### H

\*stupid grin\* Ok. In
*The Eye of the World*
, Thom said that the dead can take over a living body. If this happened, what would happen to the original soul?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

\*gave me a “haha, nice try you stupid monkey” grin\* “Read and find out.”

#### H

YAAAAAAAAAAAARG! DAMN YOU! (ok, not really)
