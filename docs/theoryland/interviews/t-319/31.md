#### [Question (What books does Jordan read?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-read.htm)

What books do
*you*
read?

#### Robert Jordan

Another ‘everything under the sun answer’. The only author names I managed to jot down from his list were: Terry Pratchett, George Martin, Elmo Lemar (lol, I know I misspelled that, but I didn’t know the author). In short, he reads everything, except for romance. He’s tried a book or two, but never passes page 100.
