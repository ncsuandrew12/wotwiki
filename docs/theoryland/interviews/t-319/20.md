#### [QuestionÂ (What are his sources and inspirations?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-sources.htm)

Are the names "Dragon", "Coramoor" and "
*Car'a'carn*
" based on chess openings?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### REPORTER

This surprised me, there has been a thread around here in which was stated that Dragon, Caro-Kann and the Coramorant (I'm not sure of the last one) are chess openings. If he had answered with a yes then I would have asked why because they're all variants played by black and rather defensive but I needn't.

#### Footnote
