# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#9)

#### [Question (Robert Jordan Himself)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-jordan.htm)

Can you personalize this?

#### Robert Jordan

You’ll have to get to the end of the line [it was a rule that sigs would come first, then anyone who wanted personalization would have to wait in line again].
Then he goes on to tell a story about a guy who was the last in line that wanted a personalization.

RJ: “You’ll have to get in back of the line.”
  
Fan: “I AM the back of the line.”
  
RJ: “Don’t make me repeat the rule.”
  
Fan: \*think, think\* \*walk around in a circle and returns to the table\*
  
RJ: “Hi! \*smile, smile\*”

[Just included this to show how cruel and sadistic he is.]
