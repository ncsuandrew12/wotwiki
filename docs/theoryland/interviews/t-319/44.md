# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #44](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#44)

#### [MahiroÂ (The Heroes and the Horn)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-horn.htm)

As I promised, here is a short synopsis of what RJ said at the book signing regarding whether or not Rand is King Aemon Reborn.

#### Robert Jordan

For Rand to be Aemon reborn, Rand would have to be the same height as Aemon if Lanfear was correct in
*The Shadow Rising*
that Rand is always the same height in each of his lives.

RJ stated that Aemon was 6'1" tall, but when I asked if Lanfear was correct, RJ stated that she was not. Normally this would not say either way if Rand was Aemon.

RJ knew immediately where I was heading (this is one very intelligent man). RJ confirmed that Rand is NOT Aemon. :-(

#### MAHIRO

\*sighs\*. He stated that it was like an author's prerogative to dangle "bait" in front of people and snatch it away. That's cruel and twisted. :-)

This not just torpedoes my theory out of the water, but just nukes it completely.

Thanks to Adrian for letting me use you as a sounding board for my theory.

If anyone wants his exact words, I can post a transcript later.

Here's what I got...

#### MAHIRO

Mr. Jordan...

#### The Creator

Yeah.

#### MAHIRO

How tall was the last king of Manetheren?

#### The Creator

The last king of Manetheren...?

#### MAHIRO

Uh-huh.

#### The Creator

The last king of... Height?

#### MAHIRO

Yes.

#### The Creator

Ummm...He'd be about 6'1" [six feet one inch].

#### MAHIRO

6'1"? Okay. And was Lanfear correct that Rand is always the same height in each of his lives?

#### The Creator

Ahhh, no.

#### MAHIRO

No... okay. Thank you.

[At this point I turned to leave.]

#### The Creator

Rand uhhh, Rand was not the last King of Manetheren.

#### MAHIRO

Thank you.

#### The Creator

I very rarely come out and tell you guys something like that. It's much more intriguing to simply dangle a bit of "bait" in front of you and snatch it away. But, ahh no. That's that's that's definitely a "blue sky" direction.

#### MAHIRO

Aan'allein, there it is nervous statements and all. You should have been there. "you can... hear him. You can... bathe in his presence...words cannot even begin to describe it. You must experience it to know. You must."

Oops, got a little carried away there... ;-)

#### Footnote

If anyone is Aemon reborn, it's Mat, since Mat had memories of being Aemon before he got his memories from the Eelfinn. However, the clues in that case point to the Old Blood and Mat being a descendant of Aemon rather than Aemon reborn.
