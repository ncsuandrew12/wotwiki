# [Interview #319, Entry #57]: Thus Spake the Creator](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#57)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (Other Lands)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-lands.htm)

Were the Seanchan animals created before or after the Shadowspawn?

#### Robert Jordan

They are the 'exotics'. They were brought to Randland from parallel dimensions (like in the Portal Stones). When Rand saw grolm in the Portal Stone world, he was seeing them in the native 'land'.

#### Footnote

This answer is a bit puzzling in that later questions to
[RJ about Portal Stones](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=204)
indicate that they connect to Mirror Worlds, not Parallel Worlds. In addition, the BWB indicates that the Seanchan exotics were brought back from Parallel Worlds via Portal Stones.
