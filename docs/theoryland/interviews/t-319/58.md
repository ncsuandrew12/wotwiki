#### [Signing ReportÂ (Bela)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-bela.htm)

As he grabbed my second book, I asked, "Is Bela the Creator?"

#### Robert Jordan

"No, she's Nae'blis," he said, laughing. He went on to say something along the lines of: I know all your theories about her being Nae'blis.

#### Reporter

As he handed me my book, I asked, "Is Bela the Dark One?"

#### Robert Jordan

He laughed. "Hmmmm," he said, "I might do something with that... No, just kidding."

#### Reporter

I stepped away but lingered as he signed the next person's first book.

#### Robert Jordan

As he grabbed the second book, he said, "She's the avatar of Ilyena Sunhair." [I think it was Sunhair. Is that her name?]

#### Reporter

He went on to say that Ilyena died, but had bad karma. I'm serious.
