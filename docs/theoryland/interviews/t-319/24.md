#### Robert Jordan

The FAQ was also mentioned, to which he gave his usual answer. One third is right, another is almost right, while the last is completely wrong.
When asked whether he was surprised that there is so much discussion on the net everyday, he simply replied, "no". He then explained that it was important as an author to have a big ego, which he did. He then explained that you didn't have to be arrogant, even though he had been described so occasionally. To me he didn't come over as arrogant.
