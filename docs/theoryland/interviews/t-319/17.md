# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#17)

#### [Question (How did the series originate?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-origin.htm)

[At this point, people were managing to wedge their way in between me and the table (coming within three inches of RJ), so I didn’t really get the whole question. Something along the lines of:] Are you making this up as you go along, or do you have everything planned out?

#### Robert Jordan

Everything is planned out. RJ has humongous files on his computer dedicated to certain topics. Example: two files for the Aes Sedai. The first one has info on each Aes Sedai. Everything she wears, eats, where she was born, etc. The second is history of the Tower. Halls, Amyrlins, organization, etc. He then said he was lucky to get a LS120 drive, because these files were getting too large for 1.44’s.
