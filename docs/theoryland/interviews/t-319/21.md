# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#21)

#### [Question (What are his sources and inspirations?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-sources.htm)

Have you ever studied comparative religion? (influenced WoT, inspiration, etc.)

#### Robert Jordan

No. RJ did make a comment on how he never studied comparative religion, but rather lived it. (He put forth a list of people that he knew in his life, with each person being a different religion. Sorry, I couldn’t write it down, since it was much too fast, and 80+ people in a small bookstore are LOUD.)
