#### [QuestionÂ (How did the series originate?)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-origin.htm)

Was the storyline for "New Spring" one that was created at the same time as the rest of the WoT plot, or did you come up with it specifically for the
*Legends*
anthology?

#### Robert Jordan

The basis was notes that I had made for myself on backstory, things that I had never intended to put into the books themselves, but that I needed to know to write the books: such as where did Moiraine and Lan meet, and where did they come from.
