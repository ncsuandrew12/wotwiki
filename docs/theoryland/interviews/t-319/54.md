# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #54](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#54)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (The Forsaken)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-forsaken.htm)

Well, It was the second time this week I got to get my book signed and talk to the great RJ. The first time was in Leiden and I didn't prepare anything so I asked something lame about what he thought of the cover art. This time I forgot to think it over again so at the last minute I had to come up with something. It turned out quite funny:

Me: "Did Slayer take Asmodean to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
before, or after he killed him?"

#### Robert Jordan

He and some other people started laughing, he thought a little and answered with a smile:

"What makes you think Asmodean is dead?"

I laughed and he continued:

"Yeah, you screw with my head, I screw with yours..." (that's actually what he said.)

#### Reporter

So Incidentally I made Jordan laugh and swear, but not answer the question.

But hey, I didn't get a RAFO.

#### Footnote

April 2001.
