# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #40](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#40)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (The One Power, the True Power, and channeling)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-op-tp.htm)

The question I asked was "Does anyone within the books have the ability to use the Flame and the Void?"

#### Robert Jordan

The answer was "The Flame and the Void is a concentration aid and you do not have to be able to channel to do it."
