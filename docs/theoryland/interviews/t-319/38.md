# [Interview #319: Thus Spake the Creator, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#38)

#### [QuestionÂ (The One Power, the True Power, and channeling)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-op-tp.htm)

Are there any channelers on the Seanchan continent that suffer from an emotional block like Nynaeve had?

#### Robert Jordan

Read and find out.

#### Questioner

(I asked this question to support my theory that the
*sul'dam*
have an emotional block, but I forgot that there are probably some
*damane*
who suffer from it as well which increased the chance to get a RAFO.)
