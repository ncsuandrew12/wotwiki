#### Robert Jordan

RJ first started reading at 4. He skipped children's books and read
*White Fang*
. By 5 he was reading Jules Verne. Since then it was his dream to become an author. But instead at uni he chose Maths(?) and Physics to become an engineer because he hadn't heard of a successful American author. Later, after he had had a near death experience, he decided it was do or don't time. He wrote
*The Eye of the World*
, and sent it in to a publisher hoping to get a reply something like "This is good, with some more experience you can do well." Instead he got, "This is great, we want to buy it."
