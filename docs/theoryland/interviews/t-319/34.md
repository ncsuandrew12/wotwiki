# [Interview #319, Entry #34]: Thus Spake the Creator](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=319#34)

#### [Signing ReportÂ (Workings of the Wheel)](http://www.oocities.org/area51/stargate/8513/creator-wheel.htm)

#### Robert Jordan

Female Dragon..NO when a female hero is needed she is one of the ones bound to the Wheel. Jordan did mention a name but I didn't hear it. But he did say the Dragon is never female.

Let's try and clear some of this up... I can't remember the exact question, but from what I read in this thread, it doesn't matter (I haven't read the Female Dragon thread). RJ said that, no, it is not possible to have a female Dragon. If the wheel needs a female Dragon, then it would weave in \*insert female Dragon name here\*. Probably because of the blank faces he was getting he then added, you can find her in the scene where Mat blows the Horn...

He also said that a soul ready to be reborn cannot change gender, therefor the Dragon is ALWAYS male.

#### Footnote

This might actually be two different reports; since we haven't found the original sources for either, we're not sure.
