# [Interview #1143: Shadows of Self-Newcastle, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1143#3)

#### Bort

Did Shardplate always have gemstones, or were they added later, after the Recreance?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They were added, but maybe not just after the Recreance. (Further clarification, and Brandon stated that they were added to Shardplate about the same time that the discovery was made that adding a gemstone to a Shardblade would allow it to be bonded. I suspect that before that, the Plate was form locked, and couldn't adapt to it's wearer)
