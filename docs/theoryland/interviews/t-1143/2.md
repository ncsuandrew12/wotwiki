# [Interview #1143: Shadows of Self-Newcastle, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1143#2)

#### Bort

In Alloy of Law, it is claimed that Wayne once stole a horse which can belch in perfect pitch. Is it true? Did Wayne really steal a Returned, or otherwise invested, horse?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There may potentially, possibly, maybe have perhaps been something going on, but it is more likely that Wayne was pulling your leg.

#### Footnote

This was my disappointing answer. I do have to admit though, the reaction from Brandon was great. I confused the Braize out of him, and most of the audience too. He did ask if this was some crazy 17th Shard theory.
