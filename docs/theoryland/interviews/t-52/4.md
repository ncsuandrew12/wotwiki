#### Fast Forward

When you started this series, with
*Eye of the World*
â€”it came out in trade paperback, the second book came out in trade paperback, and then they started coming out, initial releases, in hard cover.

#### Robert Jordan

They were in hard cover at the beginning, also.

#### Fast Forward

For the library editions.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, and it was very small printings. The publisher did not even offer them to bookstores. And the publisher was frankly quite surprised when book stores found out about the hard covers and began ordering them. After all, it's a very fat book, a very EXPENSIVE book by an essentially unknown writer. They didn't think anybody but libraries would buy it.
