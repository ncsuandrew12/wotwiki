#### Fast Forward

We're back, and we're here with the author of The Wheel of Time fantasy series, Robert Jordan. Welcome back, sir.

#### Robert Jordan

Thank you for having me.

#### Fast Forward

When we talked last, you had just finished the third book in The Wheel of Time series,
*The Dragon Reborn*
.

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Fast Forward

Since then, on a regular basis, like clockwork, a novel of six to seven hundred pages has arrived at bookstores everywhere in October, the latest of which is
*Lord of Chaos*
. Now that's six. When we talked the last time you were here, you didn't have a definite number of volumes that the story was going to take to tell. At the time you had estimated six or sevenâ€”it was very nebulous. We're at number six, and after having read the book, my impression was that it was going to take more than one more novel to complete this story.

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, yes.

#### Fast Forward

Do you have a feel for how much longer it will take? Any ideas?

#### Robert Jordan

There will be several more books.

#### Fast Forward

Several.

#### Robert Jordan

There will be some more books. There will be a FEW more books. But not too many.

#### Fast Forward

Not too many.
