#### Fast Forward

Did you think it would be the kind of phenomenon it is? The last two have been on the best seller lists.

#### Robert Jordan

Are you kidding?!

#### Fast Forward

Did you have any idea it was going to have this kind of success?

#### Robert Jordan

Of course not! I mean you hope for something like this. Nobody writes a book and hopes for a flop. And, all right, maybe if you write something you've turned out in a month just to get enough money to pay the rent, you're not hoping really, with any real thought of it making
*The New York Times*
, say. But any book you write ordinarily, you hope it's going to be successful, and maybe in the back of your head there's some little dream that, "Yes this one, this one will make
*The Times*
. And they'll invite me to Stockholm as well." You know, if you're going to dream, why not dream? But practicality says, "Forget it Jack."
