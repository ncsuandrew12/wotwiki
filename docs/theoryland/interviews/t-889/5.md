#### Michael Hudson

In March 2006, Rigney announced that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis, a rare blood disorder. After battling the disease for nearly two years, Rigney died from complications at just 57 years of age. Despite his premature death, Rigney left copious outlines, notes and audio recordings for the final volume of The Wheel of Time series,
*A Memory of Light*
. McDougal chose fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson to complete the series while she continued as its editor. Sanderson is the author of numerous fantasy novels, as well as the young adult novel,
*Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians*
. He has long credited Rigney with inspiring him to be a writer.
