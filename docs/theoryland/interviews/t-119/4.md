# [Interview #119, Entry #4]: WH Signing Report - Brandon Downey](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=119#4)

#### Brandon Downey

Then, I asked my question, which concerned the Warder bond and the
*stedding*
.

#### QUESTION

What happens to an Aes Sedai's Warder bond if she enters a
*stedding*
? Can she still detect it? What if I tie off a weave, and enter a
*stedding*
? If the weave vanishes, will it reappear when I leave? If it won't reappear, why can't shielded/tied channelers such as Asmodean or Liandrin simply enter a
*stedding*
to have their shield dissolved?

#### Robert Jordan

No, of course not. An Aes Sedai would still be able to detect her Warder in the
*stedding*
.

#### Brandon Downey

Then, I asked about going into the
*stedding*
with a weave of illusion tied on you:

#### Robert Jordan

The weave would go away, and would not come back when you left.

#### Brandon Downey

Then, of course, I asked: "Why couldn't Asmodean, or Lanfear, or someone else with a tied off shield go into a
*stedding*
and get themselves freed?"

#### Robert Jordan

No. That's different.

#### Brandon Downey

So, that's a confusing set of answers. Why is it that when shielded, the bond to your Warder can become faint enough that you don't notice it, whereas in the
*stedding*
it's just fine? Why is it that weaves that don't depend on you drawing the One Power don't work, but Wells do? And, why do shields (which are a species of a weave) that are tied off not subject to this constraint?
