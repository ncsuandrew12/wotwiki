#### Brandon Downey

After that, my friend got to ask his question, which was the one about
*Machin Shin*
and the Ways.

#### QUESTION

Is
*Machin Shin*
a result of the Dark One's taint on
*saidin*
being used in the creation of the Ways, or a result of some portion of the corruption of Shadar Logoth creeping into the Ways via the Waygate there? Or is it something completely orthogonal to both these powers, merely being a parasite that showed up once the place began to grow dim?

#### Robert Jordan

"
*Machin Shin*
is a function of the Dark One's taint on the male side of the force... er...source" [we all chuckled, and he mentioned how much he'd been traveling. :)] The corruption on Shadar Logoth is a result of an evil specifically designed to combat the Dark One's taint. This is why Rand experiences a resonance while channeling in Shadar Logothâ€”the Dark One's taint is reacting to the corruption of Shadar Logoth.
