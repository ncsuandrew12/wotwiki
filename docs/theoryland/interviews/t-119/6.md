# [Interview #119: WH Signing Report - Brandon Downey, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=119#6)

#### Brandon Downey

Another guy behind me asked if he felt he was giving the books the level of detail he wanted (and RJ said yes), then he asked about the one sentence Lan/Toram fight.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ said that he had tried writing that scene several ways, but none of the split POVs (and have we even had a Lan POV, outside of
*New Spring*
?) seemed to work out. I chimed in, "Yeah, and Lan is enough of a badass to ice some punk in one sentence", and RJ said, "Yes, Lan is very, very good at what he does."
