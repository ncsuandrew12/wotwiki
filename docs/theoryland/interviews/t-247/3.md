#### Question

Another man asked about Siuan's Talent of seeing
*ta'veren*
. Was she able to see them after she was stilled?

#### Robert Jordan

No.

#### Question

Could she see them after she was Healed?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes.

#### Question

So, if the ability to see them was based on the Power, what about the Ogier Elder who knew Rand was
*ta'veren*
?

#### Robert Jordan

For Siuan, yes, for the Ogier, no. The Ogier was able to see (or feel, I can't remember which RJ said) the Pattern shifting around Rand.
