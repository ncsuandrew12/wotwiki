# [Interview #773: SLC Signing Report - Matt Hatch, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=773#9)

#### Luckers

Was Lews Therin one with the land like Rand is?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Dragon is one with the land...so the answer is yes.

#### Matt Hatch

He went on to say that it says the Dragon, not the Dragon Reborn, making the point that it most definitely applied to Lews Therin. (I riffed off a second related question from Luckers which was: Did he have the same extra abilities?) Instead I asked:

#### Question

Considering
[what you mentioned](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#17)
regarding Lews Therin's ability to sense the lack of inhabitants within miles of the spot he was at in the Prologue, is this ability something that comes from being the Dragon, being
*ta'veren*
, or a Talent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(paraphrased) It's not a Talent, but I won't say whether it is a factor of being the Dragon or something about being
*ta'veren*
.

#### Matt Hatch

Luckers, I asked this question because the way Brandon answered the first it seemed apparent to me that the Dragon is Lews Therin is Rand, as far as 'one with the land' and abilities. My interest then became that specific ability he noted in Lews Therin during the re-read.)
