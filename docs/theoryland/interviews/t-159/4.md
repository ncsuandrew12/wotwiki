# [Interview #159: COT Signing Report - Matthew Julius, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=159#4)

#### Robert Jordan

He mentioned again that there's "at least two more books" and apologized for it yet again. There was no "if" clause as there was yesterday, though. Although, he did mention that he's trying to get the series done as quickly as possible, and that not one extra word would appear if it's not necessary, or something very close to that. \*sigh\*
