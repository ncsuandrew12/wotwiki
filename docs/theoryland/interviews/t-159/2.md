# [Interview #159: COT Signing Report - Matthew Julius, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=159#2)

#### Matthew Julius

Robert Jordan arrived after a very flowery introduction by some Books & Co. dude. ("The check's in the mail.") Started off by pronouncing names again ... with several "I told you so"s from folks in the crowd. Odd that, considering all of the pronunciations are in the back of the freakin' books.

#### Robert Jordan

Same pronunciations as in the signing yesterday, except I managed to listen a little closer...

Egwene was definitely E-gwain
  
Aiel—Aye-eel
  
Seanchan—Shawn-chan
  
*Tel'aron'rhiod*
was, I think, tell-erin-ree-ode or tell-erin-ray-ode, although he said it very softly and I don't think I'd get it right hearing it three times.
