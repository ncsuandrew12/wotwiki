# [Interview #159: COT Signing Report - Matthew Julius, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=159#5)

#### Robert Jordan

He talked about the three prequels that he will write, but didn't mention when he was writing them which I guess was fortunate after mentioning "no extra words". He also mentioned that the next stuff he writes will be something that's been brewing in his head for eight years now and will be completely independent of WOT.
