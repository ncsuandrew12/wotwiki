# [Interview #159: COT Signing Report - Matthew Julius, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=159#3)

#### Robert Jordan

Asmodean's killer was solved by somebody some time ago. I guess the guy sent RJ a letter or something with clues he used to solve it. RJ said that all of the clues were there before he died, and he thought about this, and then said that he believed all of the clues used were from before he died. He did not tell the person he was right and he will not tell anyone who it was that figured it out.
