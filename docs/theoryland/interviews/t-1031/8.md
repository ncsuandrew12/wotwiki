# [Interview #1031: What a Nerd Girl Says: Exclusive Interview with Fantasy Author, Brandon Sanderson!, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1031#8)

What are some books, or who are some authors, that you enjoy reading?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Terry Pratchett is brilliant, and I buy everything that he writes. If you haven't read him, you really need to do yourself a favor and pick him up. I also have to mention Guy Gavriel Kay. He's one of the great writers of the genre, and he's amazing. His writing is beautiful, interesting, fun, and exciting, but also lyrical.
