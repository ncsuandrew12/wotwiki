# [Interview #1031: What a Nerd Girl Says: Exclusive Interview with Fantasy Author, Brandon Sanderson!, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1031#1)

A few weeks ago, I was contemplating the book releases of the week and I decided, let's just get them all. One of them was Brandon Sanderson's
*Steelheart*
. When I got the book, I did a little research on Brandon and found out that he is the author of many, many books and I'm embarrassed to admit that it took some time for me to discover this.

I read
*Steelheart*
and I absolutely loved it. It blew my mind, because it was such a new concept. Superheroes who use their abilities to gain power, and use it against those who don't have powers. It's incredible. I'm excited to dive into his other novels, which have more of a fantasy feel than this book does. But we all know that's a good thing for me.

Brandon is most notable for his Mistborn series, but also has about a dozen other fantasy books just ready for my perusal.

I am honored and SO excited to share this interview with you! Brandon was just around the country for his book tour, promoting
*Steelheart*
, and I'm so grateful he took the time out of his busy schedule to sit down and talk about books and writing, and all of that with us.

So enjoy!
