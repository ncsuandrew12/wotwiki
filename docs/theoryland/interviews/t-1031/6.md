# [Interview #1031: What a Nerd Girl Says: Exclusive Interview with Fantasy Author, Brandon Sanderson!, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1031#6)

Did you always want to be a writer, or did you have other career aspirations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, I haven't always wanted to write. Unlike a lot of writers, I was not born as a novelist, and I wasn't writing as a kid. I actually didn't like books until I was a teenager. My eighth grade teacher, Mrs. Reader, gave me a fantasy novel, and it was in fantasy novels in which I discovered myself and came to love the idea of storytelling. That's when I decided I wanted to be a writer. I was fifteen, but I had no idea how to write. I just jumped into it and started practicing. I think that's the best way for someone to become a writerâ€”you're a writer if you write. If you sit down and say, "I'm going to be a writer!" and you start writing, working on your fiction, you're a writer! If you want to break into publishing, the best thing to do is to practice your craft
