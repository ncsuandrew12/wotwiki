# [Interview #630: New Spring Audiobook Interview, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=630#4)

#### Robert Jordan

I wrote
*New Spring*
to be accessible to someone who has read none of the books. That is, somebody who's read the books is going to find a few things explained in
*New Spring*
, such as what the One Power is, things that they've already had explained, things that they know. But I simply decided to go along with the way that I had done it in the novella. This is to be accessible to someone who's never read a book in the Wheel of Time.
