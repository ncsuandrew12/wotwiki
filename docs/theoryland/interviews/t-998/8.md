# [Interview #998: The Wertzone: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=998#8)

#### Joel Williams

It's all coming to end, for yourself as well as the millions who read the books. What does that mean to people reading the books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I can get a sense for it because I felt it myself in 2007. When I first was offered the project, and we signed contracts and I flew to Charleston where Harriet lives and I read the last scene that Jordan had written. The last scene in the book and the epilogue are his writing. I read that and got the same sense fans are having now. Having been on a long journey, with many wonderful experiences along the way, and having time to think about what it meant and why you loved it so much. It's bittersweet, when a journey is done. There's a sense of loss and regret. I felt it back then and I suspect that's what a lot of fans are going to be feeling.
