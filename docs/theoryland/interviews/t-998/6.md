# [Interview #998: The Wertzone: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=998#6)

#### Joel Williams

Are you concerned because you were a fan, you put something in that might've been cut by Jordan? Are you confident you ended it the way he wanted it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There were a lot of holes in the notes. I had to put in scenes where I don't know if Jordan would've put it in. We're different writers. The idea was to capture the feel, the mood, the tone. [Jordan's widow] Harriet was also his editor. She discovered Jordan when she was working as an editor and then she married him. I like to joke that it's one way to make sure your editorial advice is taken. If I strayed, Harriet would let me know. She has the final say. And we've been upfront about it, I'm not ghostwriting this. I'm a coauthor. There wasn't enough done to be finished off by a ghostwriter, it needed somebody to fill in holes. That's why I was brought on and that's what I've been doing.
