# [Interview #998: The Wertzone: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=998#5)

#### Joel Williams

You mention that started reading the books at the age of 15. As a fan of the series, did you ever think you'd be the one called upon to finish the series?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It completely blew my mind. When Robert Jordan passed away I made the choice that I didn't want to be the literary version of an ambulance chaser. So I said to my agent, we're not going to pursue this. I would love to do it, but I don't think it's appropriate. When I got called about it, it completely blindsided me. I had consciously decided I wasn't even going to let myself consider it. I never thought I'd be here where I am. I've gotten to participate in the dreams and vision of an author that inspired me to be a writer in the first place. That's been incredible, but if you had asked me what are the chances of doing something like this, I wouldn't have given myself any reasonable chance.
