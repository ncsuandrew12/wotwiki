# [Interview #998: The Wertzone: Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=998#1)

#### Adam Whitehead

A few weeks ago I was contacted by Joel Williams, a writer for CNN's website, who had interviewed Brandon Sanderson last year ahead of the publication of the final Wheel of Time novel,
*A Memory of Light*
. Ultimately the website decided not to publish the interview so Joel kindly offered to let me publish it here. As it was written for a more general audience than the SFF hardcore, there's little new information here, but it's always interesting to here Sanderson's thoughts on finishing off The Wheel of Time.
