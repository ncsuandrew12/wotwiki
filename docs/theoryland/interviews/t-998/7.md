When you were working on this project did it all feel like you were cheating on your world? Maybe feel like you were cheating on a spouse?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Laughs] That's an interesting way to put it. Not cheating on a spouse, but cheating on my hobbies. I was still able to release
*Way of Kings*
, which is my big capstone epic I'd been working on up until that point. I was still able to do a book in the Mistborn sequence. I had to put a lot aside, but it didn't feel like I was cheating because I view these characters as closely to my own as possible. Beyond that Jordan, even though I never knew him, was a mentor to me. His writing is what I studied when I was trying to figure out how to be an author. I picked up Wheel of Time and tried to figure out, how is he doing this? I wouldn't have said yes to anything else, but I said yes because it was Wheel of Time and I was so familiar and attached to these characters.
