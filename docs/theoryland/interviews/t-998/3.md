Despite the fact this his series takes up a lot of real estate on bookstore shelves, Robert Jordan is not a household name. Why is that?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Epic fantasy is a very challenging genre, I love it, but I'm aware it's a little harder to pick up. When you go to a bookstore and there's a series of 14 books, where one is bigger than three other books, that's not for everyone. But for those of us who read Epic, that big thick book is part why we love it. Not because it's thick, but because it's an entire world.
