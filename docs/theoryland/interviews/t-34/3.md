# [Interview #34: LOC Signing Report - Roxanne, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=34#3)

#### Roxanne

Now for the major announcement (and they specifically said we could blab):

Jody Lynn Nye, Todd Cameron Hamilton, et. al., are hard at work on a compendium, "Guide to the Wheel of Time." They have already produced the well-regarded books, "Guide to Pern" and "Guide to Xanth." Todd was at the signing but left early; Jody's husband (Bill Fawcett) arrived quite late and stayed after (which is where we learned this little tidbit).

*The Guide to the Wheel of Time*
is scheduled to be released with the paperback of
*Lord of Chaos*
sometime next fall. We will of course have it!
