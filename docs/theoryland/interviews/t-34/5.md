# [Interview #34: LOC Signing Report - Roxanne, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=34#5)

#### Roxanne

He is a
*big*
person, probably about 6'4" and broad. He smokes a
*huge*
pipe and carries a cane (I did not see him walk enough to be able to tell if he uses it or not, as the limo was able to pull up just outside the store). He looks pretty much like his pictures, but he's bigger. I suspect he would empathize a lot with the Ogier, with finding everything everywhere not quite big enough. We gave him a store sweatshirt, size XXL, which he greatly appreciated.
