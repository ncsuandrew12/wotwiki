## [Entry #1](./t-703/1)

#### Robert Jordan

For those that have spent much time wondering about hermaphroditic channelers, RJ doesn't know which part of the Power they use. The things people ask.

## [Entry #2](./t-703/2)

#### Robert Jordan

He also said that the tape versions of the books mangled a lot of the pronunciation.

## [Entry #3](./t-703/3)

#### Jason Atkinson

Other than that, there wasn't much new.

For those that have not been to a signing yet, they really do mean it when they say hardback books only. No signing bookmarks for friends. Sorry. He will sign the weapons from Museum Replicas (which he was rather complimentary of) but I did not see any.

## [Entry #4](./t-703/4)

#### [Jason AtkinsonÂ (22 November 1998)](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan/msg/6f380e0fa6601ab1)

I just remembered one more thing. My brother, who has just decided to join the newsgroup, asked if Robert Jordan had any of the rules worked out for the games mentioned in his books.

#### Robert Jordan

His answer was "Some of them." As RJ was literally walking out at the time, there was no chance to ask which ones or if he would market any of them.
