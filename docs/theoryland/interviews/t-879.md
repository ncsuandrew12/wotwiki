## [Entry #1](./t-879/1)

#### Jonrox

My questions tonight in Dayton, Ohio:

## [Entry #2](./t-879/2)

#### Jonrox

Who opened Cadsuane's box? (Jokingly) Is it intuitively obvious?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's not intuitively obvious who opened the box. The weaves were removed from the box so that the person who opened the box could open it.

## [Entry #3](./t-879/3)

#### Jonrox

Where was Roedran after the Field of Merrilor?

#### Brandon Sanderson

(Consternation on his face) He was goofing off somewhere.

#### Jonrox

And his army? They didn't do anything of note, eh?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right.

## [Entry #4](./t-879/4)

#### Jonrox

My take: looks like Shaidar Haran is most likely candidate for Cadsuane's box. I asked "who" and his answers didn't even identify it as a person (he didn't say "someone removed the weaves")

Also, looks like I was right about him forgetting about Roedran/Murandians after the Field of Merrilor.

I recorded the Q & A, but I haven't looked to see if it's of a quality worth uploading, since I wasn't aiming my phone at him or anything in particular. I might try to transcribe the session, though, unless the Memory Keeper posts first.
