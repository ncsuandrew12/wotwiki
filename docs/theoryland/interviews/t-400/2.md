# [Interview #400: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Annotation + Reader Mail, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=400#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

As one might expect, I've had a lot of feedback about the cameo in
*A Memory of Light*
charity drive. Many people are excited, some people are concerned. I'd like to take a few moments to answer a few general questions I've gotten.

First off, if you want to vote for the nationality of the group, it's happening right now on Tarvalon.net. I won't say anything about who is winning here, though I'll link when the announcement is made. Why? Well, some people don't want to know.

There are a LOT of hidden secrets in the Wheel of Time books like this. Everything from cameo appearances by Robert Jordan himself, to the names of street near where he lived, to legends about people in our own world, to appearances by fans. But I understand that some people don't want to know about most of theseâ€”they don't want to be pulled out of the world and the story. Therefore, I'll stay away from mentioning specifics here.

The final cameos will be written in such a way that you won't be able to pick them out without knowing already. The thing about a book like this is that you NEED a lot of new names. You don't need to worry that the people who win will walk on and say "Hey, I won the cameo! Neat!" It will be more subtle than that.

Remember, also, that there are very valid in-world reasons for this. According to the Wheel of Time mythology, we all live countless lives, over and over again, woven and re-woven into the Pattern. Because of that, people living on the Earth right now could very well be living again when the events of
*A Memory of Light*
come to pass. ;)

Anyway, thank you all for your enthusiasm.
