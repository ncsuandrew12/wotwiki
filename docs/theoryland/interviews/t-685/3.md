# [Interview #685: Robert Jordan gives MORE insight into NEW SPRING, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=685#3)

#### Jason Denzel

When he was questioned about where a new reader should start reading the series, he replied:

#### Robert Jordan

The expanded
*New Spring*
could serve as starting place, certainly, or any of the three short novels once I have them all completed, and some people may see them as easier since they are (will be) thinner books and less complicated, but I still think of [
*Eye of the World*
] as the proper starting place. I guess it's really up to where [new readers] want to begin.
