# [Interview #685: Robert Jordan gives MORE insight into NEW SPRING, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=685#2)

#### Robert Jordan

A thought occurred to me concerning the expansion of
*New Spring*
, something that I should have included in what I wrote to you previously. When I said that I'm doing the story the way I wanted to in the beginning, that also means doing it as if the reader has never read a book of The Wheel of Time. I didn't really find that one page introduction to the world that I had to use in
*Legends*
to be satisfactory. A small point, and obvious once you think about it, but I thought I'd bring it up.
