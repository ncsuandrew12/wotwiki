## Entry #1

#### leiftinspace

Can you tell me how long it was from the Sshattering of Adonalsium to the prelude of
*The Way of Kings*
when the Heralds abandoned the Oathpact?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Current timeline, which I have NOT canonized, is around 6,000 years... I have not finished with my outline document yet.

#### leiftinspace

'Cause I've looked at the current chronology and it's very, very spotty...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes it is... the real trick is... making sure that I fit in, for instance,
*White Sand*
and things with the proper amount... because I haven't released that book series yet, I have to make sure while we're doing the graphic novel, that it fits the chronology, which is why I can't quite canonize things yet.

#### leiftinspace

That one takes place before
*The Way of Kings*
doesn't it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### leiftinspace

'Cause I know one of the worldhoppers from there shows up in
*The Way of Kings*
...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah,
*White Sand*
is one of the very earliest.

## Entry #2

#### leiftinspace

I've picked up in bits in pieces that it's possible, for some people at least, to use the Shardpools to worldhop...

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

#### leiftinspace

Can non-invested people do that, or do you have to have some form of investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Hesitantly] Every individual is invested to some extent...

#### leiftinspace

Do you have to have any special investiture above and beyond the normal spark of life?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm gonna go ahead and RAFO that.

## Entry #3

#### leiftinspace

Can you write in one of my books about something we don;t know about the Shards, or at least one of the Shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Odium has killed at least one more Shard than the ones we know about.
