# [Interview #500: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: KINGS final draft, THE GATHERING STORM in Audible's tournament + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=500#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

I mentioned on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
that
*The Gathering Storm*
needed votes in Audible's 2010 tournament. Last I heard, it was beating
*The Girl Who Played With Fire*
by four tenths of a percent. Voting ends today sometimeâ€”actually it may be over by the time you see this message, but go vote anyway (if you think it should win). If it gets to the next round, it will be up against the winner of
*Beat the Reaper*
vs.
*Always Looking Up*
.
