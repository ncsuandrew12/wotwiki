First off, I've been getting a lot of email regarding the sword that Wilson gave me out of Robert Jordan's collection. For Christmas, I asked my wife to have it cleaned and mounted, and so I wanted to wait until then to post pictures. That's not all finished yet, but I figured I've waited long enough, so I took a photo for you to show how it stands right now, stylishly presented in the mounting stand my wife purchased. (With our Kick The Cheat in the background . . . )

Eventually, I want to get the mounting piece inscribed. We're thinking of having the words hand painted on there.

When I saw that one sword in the collection had a gold and red dragon hand-painted on the scabbard . . . yeah, I knew that was the piece I had to take. More pictures eventually.
