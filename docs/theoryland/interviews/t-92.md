## [Entry #1](./t-92/1)

#### Lara Beaton

I asked at the signing on Saturday. The exchange went something like this:

What happened with Elayne and that warm
*ter'angreal*
?

#### Robert Jordan

(laughs) What do you think happened?

#### LARA BEATON

We figured it must be some sort of One Power sex toy.

#### ROBERT JORDAN

(laughing harder) I may write something about that in a later book.

#### LARA BEATON

RAFO, right?

#### Robert Jordan

Exactly.

#### Footnote

This was clarified further in
*Winter's Heart*
, 'A Lily in Winter'.
