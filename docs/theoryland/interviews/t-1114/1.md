# [Interview #1114: WOR-Manchester, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1114#1)

#### BlackYeti

In Words of Radiance, we have Vasher showing up. One of his aliases on Nalthis is Kalad, which is very similar to the name of one of the Heralds on Roshar. So I was wondering how far back this connection between him and Roshar goes.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It goes pretty far back, in fact I wrote Way of Kings, the 2002 version; he was a main character and was Kaladinâ€™s sword master. I wrote Warbreaker to jump back and write out his back story, so to me Warbreaker actually came after Way of Kings. But the connection goes back pretty far, further than you would first guess.
