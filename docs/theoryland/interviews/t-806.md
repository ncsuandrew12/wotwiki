## [Entry #1](./t-806/1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

The most recent ALCATRAZ VERSUS THE EVIL LIBRARIANS annotation covers the
[penultimate chapter](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/463/)
, including the meaning of the name "Rashid" as in the Sands of Rashid.

## [Entry #2](./t-806/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's Writing Excuses podcast episode with Mary Robinette Kowal, Dan Wells, Howard Tayler, and me talks about
[the villain problem](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2012/07/15/)
. By that we mean when the hero is less active than the villain and spends most of the book reacting to the cool things the villain does. We discuss what a writer can do about this issue.

## [Entry #3](./t-806/3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

There have been a number of interviews posted recently. First off, Suvudu put up a video where Christopher Paolini and I
[interviewed each other](http://youtu.be/LX-_3AEtH_c)
this past weekend at Comic-Con International in San Diego. (With a cameo by Robin Hobb.)

#### Footnote

This is a great interview that gives you a good idea of Brandon the person rather than Brandon the writer.

[aspects of the writing process](http://www.invisiblevanguard.com/index.php/books/11-book-news/85-author-interview-brandon-sanderson)
, such as the desire for each book to be better than the last.
Dark Matter has a
[45-minute audio interview with me](http://www.darkmatterfanzine.com/brandon-sanderson.html)
