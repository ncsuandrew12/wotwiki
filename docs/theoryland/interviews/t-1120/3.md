# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#3)

#### Question

As of Secret History, are the IRE aware of Feruchemical chromium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not as fully aware - They don’t know everything.

Question

#### The Spiritual Feruchemical metals - are all four of those Cosmere-wide things?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The short answer is yes. The long answer is, there are certain things such as Investiture and whatnot, that when we write the books we translate different words as the same word because they’re the same meaning. So what you’re getting it is when they use the word “fortune”, do they mean exactly the Feruchemical, and the answer is no - but it is a very similar concept.
