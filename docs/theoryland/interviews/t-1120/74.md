# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #74](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#74)

#### Ted Herman

So I’ve got to say, I love Altered Perceptions and I was wondering if you were doing any projects like that.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um, Altered Perceptions, are we doing any more projects like that. Getting all of us together to do something is tough. We have talked about doing one where we each write a story in someone else’s world and I think that would be the most likely that you would see, like I write a John Cleaver story, and Dan writes a Stormlight story, and Mary writes a Schlock Mercenary story, something like that, but we don’t have any immediate plans to do another Altered Perceptions where we brainstorm something on air like we did.

#### Ted Herman

Would that story be… canon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, the story would not be canon. Most likely not. I mean, it’s possible.

#### Footnote

The question was about Altered Perceptions but the answer was about Shadows Beneath.
