#### Question

In Secret History, is Khriss working with the 17th Shard at that time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Khriss works with anybody who is interested in the information that she has. She is a...no, not a freelancer, really, she is a...She’d get along with Edward Snowden, right? She is for the good of the Cosmere in her opinion, she is providing this information. She thinks it’ll be useful for everyone. So if the 17th Shard comes to her and says “We want to know this” and she knows it, she will tell them. If Hoid comes to her and says “I want to know this”, she would tell him. So Khriss will work with anyone who she thinks their motives are...are for the good of the Cosmere in general.

#### Question

Not strictly a mercenary…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, not a mercenary, she’s kind of a freedom of information type person.
