# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #55](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#55)

#### Question

The Aons on Sel, they’re all based on - I assume the Inshape of the landscape around Elantris. Covestiture in Elantris itself, all the sigils are based on the general uld that magic work in other places based on geography on the other places with their Investiture, or is that exclusive to Sel?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is an aspect of the Selan magic system… did I say Selian or Selan? Can’t remember which one we settled on, Peter knows…

#### Question

Selish.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, Selish, that’s what we settled on, isn’t it, yeah, Selish magic system. This is why we have copy editors [laughter] That’s a feature of the Sel’s magic system that… as far as I know, no-one has pulled out in any decent reason for. But there’s a distinct reason that could be figured out, but it’s… one of these things that will make sense when I explain it, but I’m not sure if it’s quote-unquote “intuitively obvious” to the average reader. I don’t really think that it necessarily is that, but it will make perfect sense once it’s explained.
