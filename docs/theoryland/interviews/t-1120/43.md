# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #43](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#43)

#### Question

If the highstorms existed prior to the Shards’ arrival, what’s the relationship between the highstorms and the Stormfather?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh good question. I was wondering if someone was going to ask that. So, I’ll try...let me see…[sighs] You know, I’m actually going to RAFO this one. And let me tell you why, because I mean, I want to give you some reasons to be interested in the things that Dalinar will be talking about with the Stormfather. So this is a RAFO with an explicit promise for book 3. These are things that will be covered now that we have bonded the Stormfather to a person who can now ask some of these questions. I could totally just tell you now, but where the fun of that? Read book three.
