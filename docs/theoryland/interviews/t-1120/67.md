# [Interview #1120, Entry #67]: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#67)

#### Question

In the Emperor’s Soul, you indicate sort of the [opposite?] to the kandra in regards to… Soulstamps should be made with bone and are considered the lesser… With crystal is the highest. With kandras, their true bodies are crystal, they are considered weak. Bones are considered strong.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Iiii… I’m gonna stop you right there, just because that’s gonna depend on the kandra, and their age, and how they feel about it. There are plenty of kandra, I think MeLaan would argue against that and be like “no! Non-bone true bodies are way better! Look, I can take my hands off and stab people with swords underneath. This is super better!” Whereas TenSoon would be like… That’s not… It’s a little bit like when I was in Korea, and people are like “things made out of concrete just feel worse! It’s bad for the to always be surrounded by concrete. Wood is better for you.” I… think there are people who would disagree with that, I think there are people who would totally agree with that.
