# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #80](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#80)

#### Question

Does hemalurgy require intent to steal the stuff? Or could somebody in theory just stab through in the exact [...] ...happen by accident?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Here’s the thing, you have seen it happen without the intent of the person holding the spike.

#### Question

But I think it’s commonly accepted that Ruin was sort of manipulating some…Totally taking the Spook example off the table, I’m just saying, someone by accident stab - whoops! stab - whoops! and have a power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Again, Ruin was involved in that. Every spike that you saw had Ruin’s intent behind it. I’m not going to answer your question, RAFO. You tried, you got me to admit that I was trying to wiggle around it, and I’ll tell you, today I wiggled around one question that none of you saw me wiggle around, really well, today. Today. I’m not going to tell you which one it is but there is one here that you all thought, you’re all like “woo!” but you didn’t realize you’d given me so much wiggle room.

#### Question

So about that space station.

#### Brandon Sanderson

It’s not that one.
