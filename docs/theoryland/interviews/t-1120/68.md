# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #68](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#68)

#### Question

If you were to combine a Soulstamp of a crystal, with a kandra true body of a crystal, would they have additional powers to compete[?compound] with regards to Mistborn. [???].

#### Brandon Sanderson

Alright, so if you took a crystal that they’re making Soulstamps out of and you gave it to a kandra, and they used it for bones, generally the kandra are not drawing any sort of extra Investiture or power from the bones, they’re making, they’re using. That’s - though TenSoon would argue that I’m wrong. [general laughter]
