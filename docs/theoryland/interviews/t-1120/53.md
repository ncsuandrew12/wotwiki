# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #53](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#53)

#### Question

What are the upper limits size-wise of what a kandra form can take? Could they say be a chasmfiend?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, they would have trouble with the square-cube law, and a chasmfiend does not, because they have a symbiosis with natural spren, which keep them from crushing themselves. So a kandra would crush themselves if they tried to do that.
