# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #35](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#35)

#### Question

Is there a relationship between the Parshendi and the airships?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The relationship is that I assumed when people saw the picture they would think Parshendi, and that was an intentional red herring. Or red and black herring. We spent a lot of time on that picture, I was like it has to look like that people, but it can’t be straight up like “Oh! This is what we’ve seen before here!” So we went back and forth on it a lot.
