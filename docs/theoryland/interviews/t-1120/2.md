#### Question

Would Nightblood appear in the Cognitive Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood would have a manifestation in the Cognitive Realm.

Question

#### Would it appear as a sword, or because Nightblood appears to perceive itself as something else, would it appear as something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You will get a RAFO. [applause] There will be some scenes in the Cognitive Realm coming up, and you will be better able to make guesses along these lines after youâ€™ve read those.
