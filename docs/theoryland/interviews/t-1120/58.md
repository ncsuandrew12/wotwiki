# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #58](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#58)

#### Question

When you’re not writing or doing everything else, what series or authors do you enjoy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Who do I read? I’ve read… last book I’ve read was Dark Knight Returns, Frank Miller, because everyone I know - I’m like, why have I never read this before? And everyone’s basing every movie off it now, so I finally read Dark Knight Returns. Before that, I read the first book of the Expanse, because it’s another one that I’ve just never gotten to. I like that, those were both good. Dark Knight Returns was good, I was expecting something like Alan Moore level, and it was more… it was good, but it wasn’t as mind-blowing, and I think that’s partially because everybody has based every movie in existence on Batman since, you know, Tim Burton, on Dark Knight Returns, and so it doesn’t feel as fresh as perhaps it would’ve if I’ve been reading in ‘86 or whenever it was released. Um, my go-to is Terry Pratchett, or Guy Gavriel Kay, but if you didn’t read Uprooted by Naomi Novik last year, it was extremely good. If you like stuff a little more literary, NK Jemison’s The Fifth Season is really good, but that’s kind of… that’s kind of almost for English Majors, that’s got viewpoints in second person future tense, and they work, and they’re really good. Nora is a very good writer, if you guys haven’t tried A Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, which is a little bit more accessible, than Fifth Season, she’s just a really spectacular writer. Um, what else did I read last year that I liked… I mean, yeah, that’s a couple. Brian McClellan’s Powder Mage, if you like my stuff, you’ll like Brian’s stuff most likely, he’s an ex-student of mine that I can’t take much credit for because he was, he was very good when he took the class. But, he’s writing flintlock fantasy that is just really good.
Someone: Listen to Writing Excuses…

#### Question

Yeah, Writing Excuses! We recommend a book on every episode of Writing Excuses, um, so.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Have you read Pat’s books?

#### Question

Have I read Rothfuss? Yeah, I’ve read Rothfuss’ books. I’ve got… I get them early! Uhm, so, um… I’ve got the Wise Man’s Fear and The Slow Regard of Silent Things, and both came with a number in the corner like “if this ends up on eBay, we know who we gave it to” sort of thing, it was watermarked, “this is Brandon’s copy, don’t sell it”.
