# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#19)

#### Question

You recently said that dragons in the Cosmere can take the form of humans. A Kandra from Mistborn can do something very similar. Is there a meaningful connection between what the dragons and Kandra can do?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, except for on fundamental Cosmere rules stuff, but that’s… I would say no, in the same way that, “is there any similarity in the way that bats and birds can fly?” Well, there is some similarity, but there is divergent evolution and stuff like that.
