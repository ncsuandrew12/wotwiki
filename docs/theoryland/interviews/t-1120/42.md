#### Question

Is there such a thing as voluntary Hemalurgy?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Voluntary Hemalurgy? Yes.

#### Question

...where you can give a power to someone through [...]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Through any means, or through Hemalurgic means?

#### Question

Er, explain what you mean by that question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

In Nalthis, you are giving up your power voluntarily to someone else.

#### Question

Specifically in the context of Scadrial here.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I mean, can you not imagine a person who’s crazy and who’s like, I will give up my power to this, you know?

#### Question

But don’t the end results negate?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can’t imagine somebody who would do that? I am absolutely sure that at some point even at creating Inquisitors there’s somebody who would be like, yes, I will give my life to the Lord Ruler, so, yes.
