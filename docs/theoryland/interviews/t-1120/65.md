# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #65](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#65)

#### Question

Will we ever see the entire map of how the different planets are spaced out in…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh, yeah, the Cosmere collection will have a star chart of the Cosmere.

#### Question

A Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Cosmere, if you will…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Now, you’ve got to remember that at the point that this comes out… the collection’s been interesting for a couple of reasons. For one reason, the collection’s coming out before Sixth of the Dusk happens in the Cosmere, right. And so Khriss gives an introduction to each world, so you’ll find her introduction to First of the Sun to be a very interesting introduction that doesn’t know things that you know because of that. In addition, the star chart is a star chart created by people who are not spacefaring. And so it is a star chart more along the lines of… it may not be one hundred percent the scale and things like that, like they’ve been able to figure out a lot of things by using the Cognitive Realm, so they’d be like “alright, here’s the relationship”, but it will be a while before you get what feels like a Star Trek star chart. Your star chart you’re gonna get in this is a fantasy star chart, which will give you the relative positions and things like that, but it’s not gonna be like you can measure exactly, which we do have! But I’m not gonna be giving you that. [audience laughs]

#### Question

Are you referring to Arcanum Unbounded, is that…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Arcanum Unbounded, yeah.
