# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #69](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#69)

#### Question

What would happen if a Forger got their hands on Nightblood and they Soulstamped it?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nightblood is so heavily Invested that it would be like trying to freeze the ocean with an ice cube. Maybe not that scale, thatâ€™s your metaphor.
