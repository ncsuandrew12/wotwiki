# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #79](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#79)

#### Question

This is from our earlier discussion. So Taravangian…(diagram king guy) He asks the Nightwatcher for two things. The capacity to stop what is coming and the capacity to save humankind. And he gets this weird thing to happen. Is the intelligence and empathy thing because both of those things can’t come true at the same time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s an excellent question. RAFO!!!

#### Question

Let me ask a parallel to that. Does the NW perceive those as the same boon or two parallel boons?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO!!! (big grin in his voice)

#### Audience

laughter
