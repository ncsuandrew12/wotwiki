# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #37](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#37)

#### Question

So, it got established when Syl transformed for Kaladin, a living Blade can become any weapon…

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, based on the perception of the wielder.

#### Question

So, why is it that there are only dead swords?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s a good question that will be answered in the future.

#### Question

Could they make a lightsaber?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They could make...metal weapons of a similar style to that, so no, we’re not talking lightsabers. Creating plasma is not something that we’re looking at.

#### Question

A bow, for example?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They could create, probably...Well, let’s RAFO that one, I’ll show you what’s going to be happening.

#### Question

You mentioned the ecology on Roshar, and you mentioned that mostly the non-sentient spren predate the [shattering of Adonalsium?]. So my question is about the evolution of life on Roshar, and how essential the highstorms are to life on Roshar, how the plants evolved...so can we assume that life that is dependent on the highstorms predates the Shattering of Adonalsium?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um…

#### Question

Can we correctly assume? [Laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’ll tell you this. The highstorms predate, and there was a lot of natural evolution on Roshar resulting in a lot of what we have there.
