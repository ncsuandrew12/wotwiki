#### Question

What color are Marewill flowers?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Marewill flowers I’ve always imagined as a kind of bluish white. But I don’t know if I ever describe that, so it possible that Peter pushed me once and I said something else. I’m assuming I’ve never done it since you don’t know...Bluish-white with a green actual plant.
