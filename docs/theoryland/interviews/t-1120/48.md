# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #48](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#48)

#### Question

One, thank you for the cultural richness you show in everything, from Legion to [...] to [...]. One a completely different note, this became a question, I thought this had been answered, but kandra can’t produce kandra children.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, yes they can. You get them some spikes.

#### Question

Can the kandra produce human children with consumed parts?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You know, I saw a big thread on Reddit about it and chose not to participate, despite being asked to.

#### Question

I thought she said that you did, so…

#### Brandon Sanderson

I gave vague and unuseful answers, and so I’m going to give the same to you. RAFO.
