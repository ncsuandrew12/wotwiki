#### Question

What happens to the spren the Parshendi bond when they switch form? So if they’re in soldier form, and they switch over to mate, what happens to the spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The spren is released.

Question

#### So when they took on void, they didn’t kill their previous spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No, they don’t kill when they - No. That’s a good question.

Question

#### Do those spren evolve in any way into something else?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Those spren that they are bonding with are generally what we call non-sapient spren, and so, no, and also the spren are barely aware that they’re bonded - the spren, the non-voidspren. Like when they’re bonding, generally what’s happening is how...It’s a symbiotic relationship, right? And the spren that get bonded to them, it’s just kind of, Oh, this is my life now! This is just normal. This is what’s happened. The same thing happens with spren involved in greatshells and things like this. This is a natural part of the natural cycle for those spren.
