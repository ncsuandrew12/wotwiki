# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #60](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#60)

#### Question

Obviously the world covers different planets, but most people on individual planets don’t know about the other planets. Is there a planet within the Cosmere where worldhopping is common knowledge?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Is there a planet in the Cosmere where worldhopping is common knowledge. Um… it’s not a planet.
Someone: It’s a space station? [Audience laughs] That’s no moon!

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s… not as far off as people laughing think that it is. [More laughter] It’s not a space station, it’s not that futuristic, but there is a place in the Cosmere where a lot of worldhoppers have settled, is where Iyatil is from, even though her ethnicity is not from there.

#### Question

Clarifying question. Is that place in the Physical Realm?

#### Brandon Sanderson

[laughs] RAFO!

#### Question

It’s the Cognitive Restaurant At The End Of The Universe?
[many references to Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy follow]

#### Footnote

This is presumably referring to Silverlight which was officially mentioned first in Arcanum Unbounded.
