# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #59](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#59)

#### Question

When it comes to the… epic-level spren on Roshar, like the Nightwatcher and Stormfather - is the number of epic-level spren equal to the number of Bondsmiths that you have on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Hm, is the number of epic-level spren related to the number of Bondsmiths you have? Well, I’ve said there’s a maximum of three. And there are three Shards involved in Roshar. I’m not gonna tell you if that’s a coincidence or not. Sorry. [laughter]
