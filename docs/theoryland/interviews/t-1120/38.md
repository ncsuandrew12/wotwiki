# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #38](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#38)

#### Question

So you mentioned earlier that a lot of the characters who are in multiple books are functionally immortal. But some of them when we saw them in actual just books, before they started jumping between worlds, they were not functionally immortal at that time. So can we then take that to mean that they somehow became functionally immortal?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can take to mean that…

#### Question

Correctly?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You can correctly. Now here’s the distinction. Some of them are not. Some of them are using tricks of...um….uh...no....relativistic time travel to move forward in the future. Some of them are not aging and others are just aging really slowly. And those are three separate things among characters you have actually seen. I will give you hints as you read the books.
