# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #27](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#27)

#### Question

What's the other god in Scadrial...Trell… or whatnot... [...] mentioning him, are there other really powerful beings out there that aren't related to the Shards?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are possibly really powerful beings, but… how should we say. [long pause] I mean...There are those who would call Hoid a really powerful being, who exist outside Shards, but if you're talking deific level things in the Cosmere, they're all related to the Shards. Or demigod level.
