# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #34](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#34)

#### Question

You’d originally said that Nightblood is way more powerful than a regular Shardblade, but at the time we didn’t know about live Shardblades, we only had dead Shardblades. So is that still true, now that we have at least two…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He is more powerful than a regular Shardblade. [Groaning and laughter]

#### Question

How does Nightblood compare to a more living Shardblade?

#### Brandon Sanderson

More living Blade? Well, let’s just RAFO that one..
