We’ve kind of circled around the issue, but Professor Leyten[?] have talked about [???] in general. Are we going to see [someone or somebody having something]

#### Brandon Sanderson

So, there… is discussion of that in my notes, we’ll see if I can get to it. It’s more of the cultural stuff for book two is more important to me right now, I’m not sure how far I will advance Rithmatics in the next book or not, but we will do some kind of origin stuff and fundamentals in the next one.
