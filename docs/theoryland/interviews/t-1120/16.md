# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#16)

#### Question

In awakening an object if you give it the sort of command like, go get the keys. How does that object perceive the world around it? Since it doesn’t have standard human senses, how does it see? how does it touch?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The closest correlation you have to this is how inquisitors see.

Question

#### So say a bronze misting managed to somehow get access to breath and blocking machine generated awaken an object, would he be able to tell that object “hey I sense this allomancer over there, can you find it”.

#### Brandon Sanderson

That is not outside the realm of possibility.
