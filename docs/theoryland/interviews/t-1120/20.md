# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#20)

#### Question

If a Kandra were to somehow take the form of a dragon, would they notice any difference in anatomy, or is it spot-on in person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Iâ€™m going to RAFO that, to leave Dragonsteel for Dragonsteel when we get there.
