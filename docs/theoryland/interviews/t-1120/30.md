# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #30](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#30)

#### Question

I know the whole, like, “all those characters are your children” type of thing, but is there a favourite one of yours, from your writing and, or how the character is played out.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Uhm, I… you know… Robert Jordan always said, “It’s whoever I’m writing at the moment”, which I’ve stolen wholesale and said that a lot of times. If I’m pressed, I’ll usually pick Dalinar, just cause he was one of the first, but that doesn’t do it justice, because you really do need to... whoever you’re writing needs to be your favourite at the time.
