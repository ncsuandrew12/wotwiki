# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#25)

#### Question

A dullform Listener is indoors when the Everstorm passes over, will they be transformed into a Voidform?

#### Brandon Sanderson

No. It depends on the strength of the boundary between them, but it is possible for them to...Being transformed, taking new forms, there is a measure of will behind it, meaning for instance, even when Eshonai took the new form, she had herself open to taking a new form. By the time she didn’t want to, it was too late. But she had made the decision, even though she’d been kind of misled in some ways. If a parshmen were even in the Everstorm, and aggressively didn't want this to happen, I'm not saying they won't, but there is room for discussion whether or not they would change there. But also one who DOES want to, and there's only a pane of glass and things like that, then yeah.
