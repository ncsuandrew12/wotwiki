#### Question

Are there people on Roshar who are pretending to be Heralds who are not?

There are definitely lots of people who have claimed to be Heralds who were not.

#### Question

You said “have.” The question was, are there?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I’m sure there are people around...[Laughter] I’m sure you can go to any city in the United States and find someone who claims to be Jesus, right? So yes! Absolutely!
