# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#6)

#### Question

Is the reason Dalinar rejects the Thrill because he has a connection to the Stormfather through his visions?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The answer is yes, this is part - this is in play. Though you could say the reason he has a connection to the Stormfather also influences the reason he rejects the Thrill, so it may be more correlation than causation, but thereâ€™s at least a little causation as well.
