# [Interview #1120, Entry #47]: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#47)

#### Question

I was just wondering if you had any plans for a longer Legion type work.

#### Brandon Sanderson

The goal was for a long time if I could get a television show off the ground, and I would write a novel to accompany it to kind of publicize the show. We sold the rights a couple times, but it never got off the ground. I still think it’s possible someday, but I probably don’t envision doing a longer one - in fact, I’ll say, I don’t envision doing a longer one right now unless that happens. Though I do envision doing a third story at some point.

#### Question

So you would say that Legion is best consumed in forty-four minute blocks?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, I mean, when I came up with the idea, I thought, this would make a great television show, let me write a few episodes.
