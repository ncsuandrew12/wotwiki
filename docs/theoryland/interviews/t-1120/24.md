# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#24)

#### Question

In the original Mistborn series, where Leras plans the 1/16 Snapping, was he not aware of chromium and nicrosil?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He was aware that they were not aware of it. He was using the kind of vague ability in some of the Cosmere magics to read possibilities on the future. He was also already not completely there when he was building this.
