# [Interview #1120, Entry #81]: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#81)

#### Question

As the Cosmere gets a lot bigger, what is your biggest worry going forward writing the books?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Going forward, my biggest worry is making sure that I do things like get the SA done as a solid, complete whole, rather than letting it become...like, too distracted about the Cosmere. Like, I’m not worried about that for Mistborn, but I’m worried about that for Stormlight. Stormlight needs to be a self contained whole, it needs to be a self contained epic, and I have to be really careful not to - in the later books in particular - let it turn into the Avengers, something like that. So that’s my biggest worry right now, that I will let too much of that seep in. I’m being very careful.
