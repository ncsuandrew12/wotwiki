# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #78](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#78)

#### Question

If Lift ate something that had like, gold leaf on it, could she change that gold leaf into Investiture or something?

#### Brandon Sanderson

So the gold leaf would probably pass through her system.

#### Question

So she wouldn’t be…?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Mhm, yes, that things that she eats that she can metabolize, she can turn into Stormlight.

#### Question

So what would happen if she ate Nightblood?
[laughter]

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, eating Nightblood would not be a smart idea for anyone. [more laughter] Nightblood would eat you. In Soviet Russia, sword eats you? I don’t know…

#### Footnote

Brandon says here that she can convert items that she can metabolize into stormlight, but during the Out of Excuses 2016 he implies that Lift can convert anything she ingests into stormlight including non food
