# [Interview #1120, Entry #44]: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#44)

#### Question

Talking about the Stormfather, are the Nightwatcher and the giant water spren, Cusicesh, are they on the same level?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Nightwatcher, yes. Um...uh...there are...I would say, a level below the Stormfather and the Nightwatcher who are also a much bigger deal than something like one of the sapient spren, and that’s what Cusicesh is.`

#### Question

So the Nightwatcher is a spren?

#### Brandon Sanderson

They call the Nightwatcher a spren. Everyone in the books thinks the Nightwatcher is a spren. That’s what they would call...that’s what they would call, if they knew what Honor was, they would call Honor a spren. A spren is Investiture that is alive. So they would call Nightblood a spren. That’s the word for what all of these things are. They would probably call Adonalsium a spren. [Laughter] If...Right...So.

#### Question

What would Hoid call one of those? What would Hoid call the Nightwatcher?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Um…[long pause]

#### Question

If Hoid were to use a non-proper noun?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Unpleasant names. [general laughter]
