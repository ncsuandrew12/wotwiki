#### Question

In the Rithmatist you previously confirmed that lines of vigor behave a lot like light waves, if two lines of vigor collide do we have wave interference patterns?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I am planning some wave interference patterns and things like that, definitely.

Question

#### Does it matter if they come from the same rithmatist?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Eh...It should not, no.
