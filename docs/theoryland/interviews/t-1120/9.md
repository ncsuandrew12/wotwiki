# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#9)

#### Question

So I noticed in MIstborn Era 1, a guard of the Venture house was named Felt. There’s also a character in Words of Radiance, a scout called Felt. Is that the same person?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It is the same person. That’s one of the two things I can remember surprising Peter, when he’s like, “This name is kind of interesting. It’s kind of different. You sure you don’t want to use more of a Vorin name?” I’m like, “Go read back in Mistborn.” He’s like “OH!” [laughter] I’m always happy when I surprise Peter, because the other big one that surprised him was when I put Vasher into Stormlight. He’s like, “Huh...Vasher is in Stormlight?” And I’m like, “Go read Way of Kings Prime.” Which he had read, which is the Way of Kings I had written in 2002, where lo and behold Kaladin’s sword master is Vasher, named Vasher at that point. He hadn’t realized I’d written Warbreaker after as an exploration of this character who’d already been in the Stormlight Archive. Those are the two things I can remember Peter not catching about the Cosmere, he gets most everything.
