#### Question

With Awakening, given that you know the correct command word, could you potentially give anything to the other person, using Awakening?

#### Brandon Sanderson

#### Question

#### Brandon Sanderson

How would you find what those are? Spend a lot of time researching the Cosmere, have some conversations with Khriss, and come up with some theories! There’s a bunch of them written in the books and indicated, so yes.
