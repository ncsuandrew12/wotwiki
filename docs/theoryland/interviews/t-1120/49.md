# [Interview #1120: Brandon Sanderson RAFOlympics at JordanCon 8, Entry #49](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1120#49)

#### Question

On Roshar, because of no tectonic activity, it seems possible that the magnetic dynamo inside doesn’t create enough of a magnetosphere to protect life from solar radiation, so my question is, do the highstorms function as a form of protection against solar radiation?

#### Brandon Sanderson

That’s an excellent question. That’s a RAFO. That’s a really cool question.
