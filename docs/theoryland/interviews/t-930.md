## [Entry #1](./t-930/1)

#### electrokinetic

I'd been wondering why Demandred didn't just use the True Power to dispatch the various swordsmen that challenged him, and I got to ask it last night at the Huntington Beach signing. I thought I'd post it here in case anyone else was wondering the same thing.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon's response was that Demandred was the most wary and cautious of the Forsaken and he wasn't going to "mess with that medallion", not knowing fully what it was or what it could do, especially since he suspected that the swordsman was Lews Therin in disguise.

## [Entry #2](./t-930/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

I also asked if we would ever get to hear the conversation between Hawkwing and Tuon, and he said that it did happen and would have had a great impact on future novels were they to be written.

#### electrokinetic

Not really the answer I was looking for but an interesting revelation.
