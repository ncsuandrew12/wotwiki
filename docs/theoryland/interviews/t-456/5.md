# [Interview #456, Entry #5]: Louie b. Free Show - Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=456#5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Can I give a shout-out to an independent bookstore in your market?

#### Louie Free

Yeah please, go ahead. Yes, you can.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I think you cover Pittsburgh, right?

#### Louie Free

Well, we're in northeast Ohio, western Pennsylvania. Absolutely, go ahead.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Okay. Because there's a store in Pittsburgh that I love, the Joseph-Beth Booksellers there.

#### Louie Free

Oh yeah. Well, there's also one in the Cleveland area. Yeah, there's a few of them around. Go ahead.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I love the Jo-Beth Booksellers. They are amazing people, and they've been supporters of my books from the beginning. You know, the thing you get at an indy bookstore like that is you get people who love the books, who aren't just working a job, who are working a job they love. They go there on purpose. And they read the books. The manager in the Pittsburgh Jo-Beth contacted me just out of the blue based on my own books, my Mistborn series, just saying, "I love these books. We want to do a big display on them. And would you just tell us some of the books that you've loved in your life so that we can put up the display with it?" And she took a picture of it and sent it to me. Wonderful store.

#### Louie Free

Oh god, that's great. And again, when you buy, you keep those stores alive, folks. Think of how many stores that you always loved, wherever you are, that are gone now. And then you thought, afterwards, you know what, I should have gone there more, maybe I shouldn't have ordered online, and I always knew that was important in my community, and now they're gone. And the way to keep them is to patronize them. And as I say, even if you don't have a real independent bookstore, if it's a Barnes and Noble or a Borders that's in your community, you still want to hold onto those.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Right. Yeah, you do. I mean, I bought all my books growing up at a little independent science fiction and fantasy bookseller. I actually bought
*Eye of the World*
, the Robert Jordan book, at this bookstore.
