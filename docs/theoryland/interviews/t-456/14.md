#### Louie Free

Brandon Sanderson, believe me, I wish we had more time. Maybe we can talk again.

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would love to talk again.

#### Louie Free

Really? You are an amazing, amazing guy. You know, obviously you are such a giver of a wonderful gift to so many, and now to millions. The success of
*The Gathering Storm*
is indicative of that. Again, I know you've got to go, so I will make this brief, but I just want to thank you. Thank you so much for all your time today.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Oh no, no. Thank you. This has been one of the best interviews I have ever done, hands down. Thank you, Louie.

#### Louie Free

Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
