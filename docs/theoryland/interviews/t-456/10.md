# [Interview #456: Louie b. Free Show - Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=456#10)

#### Louie Free

Let me ask you this, Brandon Sanderson, if we can. The
[blog post](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/550/EUOLogy-Goodbye-Mr.-Jordan)
, the one that you wrote after Robert Jordan passed away: "You showed me what it was to have vision and scope." Tell me a little bit about that post.

#### Brandon Sanderson

When he passed away, I didn't know how to respond. My very first impression was I knew that he and Harriet, his editor, were married and I felt just terrible for her. And then I felt terrible—and this is selfish—but I felt terrible that I hadn't gone and met him. I'd seen him at that one convention and the fact that I hadn't walked up and shaken his hand and said how much he meant to me. And I, at the same time, sat there thinking, 'Man, everyone in fantasy who's an author is probably going to start chasing this project,' and that made me feel sick. And so, it actually took me three or four days to get my feelings down on paper, or on screen at least. I composed a number of things and I tossed them, and I kind of struggled with it. And I eventually came up with this short,
[little eulogy](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/550/EUOLogy-Goodbye-Mr.-Jordan)
. It's not really that long. You can find it on
[my web site](http://brandonsanderson.com)
just by clicking on my
[Wheel of Time link](http://brandonsanderson.com/portal/The-Wheel-of-Time)
.

#### Louie Free

Okay now, I want to know. I'm getting people that are saying specifically. I want to put it up if you don't mind. Is it at the blog? Is it at...? I'm looking at the Wheel of Time link...I mean, I'm looking at the...
[Wheel of Time portal](http://brandonsanderson.com/portal/The-Wheel-of-Time)
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, click on the
[portal](http://brandonsanderson.com/portal/The-Wheel-of-Time)
. And then just on the left, there's a little link that says '
[Robert Jordan Eulogy](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/550/EUOLogy-Goodbye-Mr.-Jordan)
'.

#### Louie Free

Oh, I see it. I see it. Okay, okay. And I will put a direct link up to that. And again, it's
[brandonsanderson.com](http://brandonsanderson.com)
. I'm sorry, Brandon. Go ahead.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yeah, a direct link to that would be great. If people wonder why I spelled 'eulogy' wrong, it was a long running thing on my web site, so I know that it's spelled wrong. It had to do with essays that I was writing.

But anyway, so I wrote this, and I talked just about picking up
*Eye of the World*
for the first time, and why I had chosen TOR when they had come to me and I'd finally had a book offer. After writing thirteen novels, I sold my sixth one. And after having them finally come to me and say, 'Yes, we'll publish you.' Actually, my agent said, 'You know we could probably, now that we have an offer, go somewhere else and try and bid it up,' and things like this. And I said no. I said no, this is TOR This is Robert Jordan's publisher. No, we're not going to do that. I was where I wanted to be. And I kind of wrote about that. I just wrote about what he'd meant in my life. It was just something from the heart. I never expected it to be seen by that many people.
