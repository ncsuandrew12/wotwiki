# [Interview #463: TGS Book Tour, NYC Stormleader Dinner - Ted Herman, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=463#6)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Stated that the Ajah Heads in the White Tower conspired to send Sitters to Salidar who would speed up reconciliation, but not draw suspicion due to being supporters of Elaida previously. They chose young Sitters in the Tower as placeholders. However some of the Sitters who left the Tower went of their own accord.

The Ajah Heads for the reunited Ajahs will likely be the ones who led their Ajahs before the split. Will be determined quietly and is Ajah business only.
