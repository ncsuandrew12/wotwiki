# [Interview #463, Entry #18]: TGS Book Tour, NYC Stormleader Dinner - Ted Herman](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=463#18)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon spoke of his creative freedom in writing, and filling in blanks or making choices that Jim left for the story, but wanted to include everything that Jim wrote as completely as possible. Instead of giving a % of how much was Brandon's, he said it was 100% Brandon and 100% Jim since they both put their all into the book, and all that Brandon wrote was inspired by the previous books, and that Jim dictated, even from his deathbed, because of his passion for the story and the fans.

#### Ted Herman

That is just amazing to me, beyond what words can describe.
