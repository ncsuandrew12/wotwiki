## Entry #1

#### Question

Would a conventional science fiction society be able to travel between worlds via FTL?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, they definitely could. In fact, built into the system is...you will see space travel. In fact I have several of them plotted, I just can't write them yet. It is going to be really fun. One of my very first ideas for the cosmere was this spaceship going between, and actually, Sixth of the Dusk, which is coming out, the Writing Excuses Anthology one, is cosmere and they mention space travel in it, so...

## Entry #2

#### Question

Are we going to see any other compounders like Miles Dagouter, but with other abilities?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, I plan to do more, just to show off what different compounding can achieve, so you will see some more like that. you will some other really interesting interactions with the magic system.

## Entry #3

#### Question

Who is your favorite character you have written?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

It is like picking between your children, blah blah, Perrin, blah blah. Picking between my own, I would probably say Dalinar. I started writing a story about Dalinar when I was 15, and then I finally got to write his book years later, so yeah.

## Entry #4

#### Question

Are you ever going to do a big story about Adonalsium and take it out of the shadows?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, um, the series called Dragonsteel itself is that, and then at then end of all of this, there will be kind of a climactic one. So eventually yes, it is just a little ways off.

## Entry #6

#### Darnam

Would you please draw Aon Aon with the chasm line, so we know where the calamity the chasm lines are?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I always imagined it right there. Um, and so if you finished it... but the strictures of the first book, I didn't quite know what I was doing yet, and I was trying to match a map that didn't quite match what I had in my head. I could do it so much better now. But, the problem is, it is kinda down here at the bottom of this, but where I described it....if you don't mind me putting in this... I described it right there in the book, and it needs to be up more.
