# [Interview #154: COT Signing Report - Dan Olin, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=154#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Mr. Jordan stated that the first book he ever read was
*White Fang*
, at age four. When given his library card at five, he joked that when the librarian introduced him to the children's section asking him if he would like to have
*The Velveteen Rabbit*
read to him, he replied, "What, are you kidding?"... promptly being labeled a smart-aleck.

He found it very difficult to get access to adult reading, and would have to sneak out of the children's section, snag books, and bring them back to the children's section to hide them where he could access them without being pestered. No one ever checked the children's section for the adult books he had sequestered there. Jordan said he never read children's books until much older.

At age five he had three novels stacked on a table in his room (one of which included a Verne work) and he stated that at that moment he knew he would "make stories like that someday."
