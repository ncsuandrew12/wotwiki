# [Interview #154: COT Signing Report - Dan Olin, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=154#1)

#### Dan Olin

Mr. Jordan entered Kepler's Books, an independent local book store, at about 5:45 PM on Saturday, January 11th. I was perusing the bookstore when I recognized his voice as he walked from the entrance to the employee only area (I had just heard it via the recent interview referred to on dragonmount.com). After about 75 chairs, a signing table, and a Kepler's speaker podium were set up, Mr. Jordan was introduced at 6:25 PM.

#### Robert Jordan

Limping slightly to the front with his cane and recognizable hat (is that Mat Cauthon's?), he pausing momentarily for effect, and suddenly burst into "Are you ready to rrrrrrumble? It's smack down Menlo Park!!" A few moments later, "First off...its Nynaeve. [laughter from the audience] Egwene. Seanchan. Cyndane.
*Saidin. Saidar*
..." etc., the normal pronunciations.

He then took several questions from the audience for approximately 25 minutes. I did not bring a tape recorder so my summary of his answers and any quotations here are not verbatim, and only include points of interest that I remember.
