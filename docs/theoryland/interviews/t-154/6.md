# [Interview #154: COT Signing Report - Dan Olin, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=154#6)

#### Robert Jordan

One audience participant queried if he wrote down ideas that interested him for possible inclusion in future books, and where did he find all of his character names. He responded that he used to keep a journal of ideas for future projects, but stopped a number of years ago because to cover all of his current ideas along, he would have to live to be age 350. He bases his character names often on myth, giving the examples of "Al'Thor" and "Artur Hawkwing" being based on King Arthur of Arthurian legend. Other times he sees a name in
*The New York Times*
or
*Wall Street Journal*
that sounds intriguing when pronounced, and he merely changes the spelling slightly to incorporate that sound.
