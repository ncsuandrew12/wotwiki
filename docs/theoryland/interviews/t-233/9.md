# [Interview #233, Entry #9]: KOD Signing Report - Fomu](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=233#9)

#### Fomu

One question asked was very interesting, if only because of its absurdity. An individual asked a question, in very slurred speech, asking if RJ had enjoyed his time working with the Shrub as the ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ, and the audience, were quite confused by the question. I wondered if the guy was drunk, crazy or just at the wrong book signing. RJ asked him to repeat the question, and sure enough, the guy asked the same question again. RJ denied all knowledge of said events, that he was never an ambassador, that he had never been to Saudi Arabia and he knew nothing about a shrub. (For those of us up on our US politics, 'shrub' is the nickname for our illustrious president, W.)
