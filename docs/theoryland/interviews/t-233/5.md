# [Interview #233: KOD Signing Report - Fomu, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=233#5)

#### Robert Jordan

After about a dozen questions, he stopped and informed us that every person thus far to ask a question was male and he was tired of answering questions from guys. He knew that there had to be some woman there who read the series and wasn't there getting her lazy boyfriend's books signed because he wouldn't get off the couch.

It did take a few moments for a woman to speak up, but speak up she did.
