# [Interview #233: KOD Signing Report - Fomu, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=233#7)

#### Fomu

A few more questions, and then it was time to sign books. Jordan did forget to mention the working title of book 12, so I did him a favor and passed it around as I spoke to others in the crowd. Since I had a pass with a B on it, I moved quickly to the line, behind the A group. Second in the B line, I was in the presence of the Creator quite soon.

#### Robert Jordan

He signed my two books and I asked about the lack of his distinctive Rand's hat and he explained to me as he did nine years ago when I met him at my first signing, that it was a replica of Mat's hat, but someone named Rand had made it. I laughed, telling him I remembered the story all too well but wanted to see it again. It was in the back, probably drying, because of all the rain with which we had been blessed this evening. The man behind me in line was kind enough to take a picture of myself with the Creator, and if you wish to see the two of us, feel free. I'm the younger, slightly less good looking and incredibly poorer one on the left!
