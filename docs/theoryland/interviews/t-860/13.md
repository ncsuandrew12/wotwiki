#### Brandon Sanderson

I am reading a book by
[Brian McClellan](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6524620.Brian_McClellan)
, who was a student in my class during one of my first times teaching it. I teach a class at BYU [Brigham Young University] called How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy. I just started reading his debut novel,
[*Promise of Blood*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790883-promise-of-blood)
, and so far so good. I always have sitting on a shelf near me a
[Terry Pratchett](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1654.Terry_Pratchett)
novel, who I think is (well, it's probably a tie between him and
[Guy Gavriel Kay](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay)
) the greatest fantasy writer writing right now.
