# [Interview #860, Entry #6]: Goodreads Interview with Brandon Sanderson](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=860#6)

#### Goodreads

You've written extensively about magic systems in fantasy novels, including "Sanderson's
[First](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/40/Sandersons-First-Law)
and
[Second](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/100/Sandersons-Second-Law)
Laws" for fictional magic. Were you tempted to change any part of the Wheel of Time magic system?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Being a fan for so long, there was a danger that I would come in and say, "Well, this is my chance to fix all the things that have bugged me about the Wheel of Time." But I realized I couldn't approach the story like that.

Robert Jordan handles magic systems in a different way from how I handle a lot of mine. He works harder to preserve the sense of wonder than I do. I explain more nuts and bolts. He reserves the right to say, "We don't know how this works." I had to tell myself my job is not to change that. That's how his magic works, and it works really well like that. Even though on the Sanderson's First Law scale, it is much more to the middle than mine are. Mine are on the right side (right meaning direction-wise, not correctness-wise), where his is more toward the middle and
[Tolkien](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/656983.J_R_R_Tolkien)
is more toward the left side. And I didn't want to push it.

The balance that I struck is, I was going to do my best to avoid a lot of new weaves [different kinds of magic], and I was going to take the existing weaves and push them further along the scale than I would let myself [in my own books]. The two instances are what happens in the world of dreams and gateways. I told myself, I am going to play with these two parts of the magic systems and let myself do some of the fun things I will do with magic. I am not going to spend a lot of time inventing new parts of the magic.
