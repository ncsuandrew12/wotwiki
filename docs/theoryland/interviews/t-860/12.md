What authors, books, or ideas have influenced you?

#### Brandon Sanderson

How many pages do we have? The obvious one is Robert Jordan. I like to list three authors who got me into fantasy. I was not a reader when I was younger, and it was the right book at the right time, which was
[Barbara Hambly](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10333.Barbara_Hambly)
's
[*Dragonsbane*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176268.Dragonsbane)
. I love what she has does with fiction. So she is kind of responsible for me in a lot of ways. Once I discovered that, I ran to the library and tried to dig out something that was like
*Dragonsbane*
. I didn't even know this genre existed, and next in the school library's card catalog was
[Anne McCaffrey](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/26.Anne_McCaffrey)
's
[*Dragonflight*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61975.Dragonflight)
. Her
[Pern books](http://www.goodreads.com/series/40323-dragonriders-of-pern)
I would also list as a very big influence. And then
[Melanie Rawn](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8661.Melanie_Rawn)
and the
[Sunrunner books](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123512.Sunrunner_s_Fire)
. Her use of magic is part of what made me interested in magic systems. Classically, I really like
[*Les Mis√©rables*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24280.Les_Mis_rables)
and also consider myself a
[Shakespeare](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/947.William_Shakespeare)
buff and love to see Shakespeare live.
