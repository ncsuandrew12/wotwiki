# [Interview #860: Goodreads Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=860#5)

#### Goodreads

Many plot points are in motion at the end of the next-to-last book in the series,
*Towers of Midnight*
. Can you set the stage? What can readers expect in the final book,
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

A little bit of spoilers here: One of the big things we got going on is Rand and Egwene on opposite sides of the big decision regarding what needs to happen with the last battle. It's a power struggle that has been brewing for a long time behind the scenes. Some may not have noticed it until I brought it to the forefront in the last book. We've just had a main character who has been gone for a long, long time show up again in the end of
*Towers of Midnight*
, and there are ramifications for that. Can we work together? How do we work together?â€”that's going to be one of the themes.

And, of course, this is the last battle, which means there's a lot of war in this book. And that's actually very different for a Wheel of Time book. There have been big battles before, but not ones that span half of the book or more.
