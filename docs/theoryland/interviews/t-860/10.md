# [Interview #860: Goodreads Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=860#10)

#### Goodreads

On that note, Goodreads member
[Regina](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6164822-regina)
says, "My biggest question for Mr. Sanderson is if finishing the Wheel of Time series has had any sort of impact on him or his other writings, and if so, in what ways?"

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, it has, certainly because I learned a lot. Wheel of Time I've described as "power lifting." I had to get into shape as a writer very quickly and swim in the deep end, and it has improved my writing drastically. A good example of this is
[*The Way of Kings*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings)
. I was writing it in 2002, and the draft wasn't good enough. I didn't know why, but I was dissatisfied with it, and I told my editor we weren't going to publish it yet. I didn't know what I had to learn, but knew I had to learn things. The ideas were all there, but the technical skill wasn't there yet to pull off the book that I wanted to do. It wasn't until after finishing
*The Gathering Storm*
that I knew what was technically lacking, and I was able to go back and write that book. I feel it turned out quite well on the second attempt.
