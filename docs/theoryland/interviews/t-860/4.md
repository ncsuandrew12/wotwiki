# [Interview #860: Goodreads Interview with Brandon Sanderson, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=860#4)

#### Goodreads

How much liberty did you have in deciding which characters would play the biggest roles in the last battle?

#### Brandon Sanderson

In a lot of ways the "why" or the "how" was not said, and in other places in the outline there were just empty holes where a character is in one place and 800 pages later, then another place.

[In the final book] we've got a lot of questions that still need to be answered. Robert Jordan did leave me instructions on which ones, in some cases, not to answer. There are things he wants to leave unresolved, and there are other things he said do answer this, and there are some things that he said either way. He left a lot of instructions about who lives and who dies, but there are also plenty of cases where I got to make the judgment call. It's a big, cool, awesome, scary thing, and all of the gloves are off. Anything can happen in this book, because I don't need to worry about setting up any future books.
