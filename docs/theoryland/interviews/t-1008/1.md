I hate to admit it but
*Steelheart*
is the first book I have read by Brandon Sanderson. That being said it will not be my last. There is no doubt that readers of all ages will love it. Taken into an alternate reality where people with superpowers (known as Epics) splinter the world into their own domains, one young man loses the person he loves most. In that moment, he discovers that this Epic, Steelheart, can be hurt and he is determined to hurt him again.

BTW...Brandon's answers below are a transcription from audio he recorded specifically for Big Shiny Robot. Enjoy!
