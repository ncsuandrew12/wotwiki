Assuming that
*Steelheart*
is on screen at some point (I think it will be) - is that something you're looking towards? Something you'd want to script, or just sell the rights and allow the different medium to tell the tale its own way?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I feel the best film adaptations are those that are more strongly adapted. I love when filmmakers are respectful of the source material, but when they try to stick too closely to it, I feel that the films aren't as good. I would love to be involved in making a film, but not having practiced the screenwriting skillset as much as I have novel writing, my instincts are to find people I trust to make a good film and allow them to use their talents to adapt the novel.
