# [Interview #643, Entry #11]: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#11)

#### Kurafire

You very often answer questions with "Read and find out"—

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, yes, and I will say that the answer to the coming question is Read And Find Out. I like that answer. My wife once asked me what I wanted for dinner, and I told her 'Read And Find Out'. Three days before I had the nerve to go home.

#### Kurafire

Well the question was: but will you really write down concrete evidence to all the mysteries from your books, or will you just add a last bunch of hints in the next few books and 'call it a day'?

#### Robert Jordan

Read And Find Out.

Some things will be concrete evidence, some things will be hints and clues. I do not want to tell you what’s coming. If I would tell you everything what's coming, you'll start saying: "Oh gee, I knew that. I knew
*that*
. Yeah he's getting awfully boring. I'm gonna go and read Terry Goodkind..."
