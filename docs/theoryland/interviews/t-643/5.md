# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#5)

#### Kurafire

When you started writing, did you expect or hope to become so popular and famous?

#### Robert Jordan

I certainly did not expect it. That would go beyond having an ego, becoming an
*egomaniac*
. Everybody
*hopes*
that what they’re writing will be popular. I don’t think anybody writes a novel and says "I hope 50 people will read this". That’s all they want, just 50 people. You hope that what you write is gonna be popular, but you certainly don’t expect it.
