# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#6)

#### Kurafire

Do you enjoy listening to music, and if so does it aid you in acquiring inspiration for your writing?

#### Robert Jordan

In many ways, yes, I listen to every sort of music. Classical, Rock, Jazz, Country, Western, Ethnic music from various countries... I do not write to Jazz, or Rock. I like all country western, I like to listen to it, or blues, but I can’t write to it. I write, or at least maybe I can write to some Jazz, I mainly write to classical music, and
*some*
jazz. I usually have music playing when I write.

#### Kurafire

If a well-known composer would like to compose a musical score for your entire books, what would your opinion about that be? Would you like it?

#### Robert Jordan

I’d be very interested to see what he or she would do! [smiles]
