# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#8)

#### Kurafire

What will be the very first thing you'll do when you finish writing the last Wheel of Time book?

#### Robert Jordan

If the past is any indication, I will immediately get into a plane to New York to hand it in to the publisher [laughs]. What I will probably do at that point is take a vacation, after I finish the tour of the book. I will probably try to take a vacation of a couple of months, and then get to work on the next project.
