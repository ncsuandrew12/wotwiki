# [Interview #643, Entry #12]: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#12)

#### Kurafire

What are you planning to do with all the notes you have made for The Wheel of Time when you are completely done with the series?

#### Robert Jordan

I might publish some of them. I have thought about publishing some sort of concordance, or single volume dictionary/encyclopedia, a very straightforward thing, not with any pretenses to be part of the Wheel of Time. From the beginning my editor has kept a list of words—created words—every
*plant*
that I mentioned, animal that I mentioned, every person’s name that was sitting in a town, or a village or an inn, every song. And it’s all there in that long, long list, and just the bare list right now I think is probably over a thousand pages. Which would present some difficulties, but the thing is I think I might take that list and give the basics, give definitions, put in definitions, put in references, who this person is, where this person’s seen.

#### Kurafire

Sort of like a massive glossary..?

#### Robert Jordan

In a way, yes. I don’t know, I think, perhaps, there might be some interest in that. I certainly wouldn’t do it until this is all over, because I, uhm, if and when I do it, I would like it to be complete, just nothing left out.

#### Kurafire

There is a large request from the fans that you do not let it to be edited, and that you publish them in their ‘raw diamond form’.

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, ah, okay.
