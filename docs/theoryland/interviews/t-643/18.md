# [Interview #643, Entry #18]: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#18)

#### Kurafire

If you could be one of the characters from your books, within your own story, who would you like to be most?

#### Robert Jordan

[laughs loudly] I don’t
*wanna*
be in this story. This world is entirely too interesting, too much going on. Any sane man wants to live in a place where there’s not a lot going on. Where there’s not a lot going on, and they can have a peaceful existence, and a long life. Trying to live in the world of my books would be, miserable, and probably short. I don’t know about [...] but, definitely miserable and short.
