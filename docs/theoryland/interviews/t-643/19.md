# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#19)

#### Kurafire

Something quite unusual from now on. Is there anything you’d like to talk about, doesn’t have to do with Fantasy at all, but just want to share your opinion with the world?

#### Robert Jordan

[snickers] No, nothing. The world has enough people who try to share their opinions with the whole world, and I figure I will share my opinions with the whole world when I’m backed into a corner and prodded with a pitchfork. Other than that, I’m sorry, I will just pass on that.
