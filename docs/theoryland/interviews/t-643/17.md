# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#17)

#### Kurafire

What do you think of the more unusual theories that some of your fans come up with?

#### Robert Jordan

Well some of them have made me wonder occasionally whether they were reading the same books I wrote.

#### Kurafire

And in general?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh, in general, they have seen what I’m trying to do, sometimes, occasionally, they’ve seen
*through*
what I’m trying to hide. And sometimes they are fixated on something that is so minor. They seem to think they found a major clue to something, but it isn’t, but ehh, I don’t always tell them. I will certainly tell if something
*isn't*
that important.

#### Kurafire

You just say read and find out and laugh behind their backs?

#### Robert Jordan

Sometimes. No I laugh right in their faces. If I’m gonna laugh, I don’t laugh behind
*anybody*
’s back.
