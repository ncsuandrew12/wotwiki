# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #16](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#16)

#### Kurafire

You've said in another interview that your current working-title for your next series is "Shipwreck". Will it be another Fantasy series like Wheel of Time, or something completely different?

#### Robert Jordan

Oh it’ll be another Fantasy series. Do
*not*
say it’s like the Wheel of Time because it’s a Fantasy series, I do not intend to have any real connection between them. It’s a different world, a different universe, different cultures different laws, not simply a shift into the past or the future in the same world of Wheel of Time.
