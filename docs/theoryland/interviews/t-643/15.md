# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#15)

#### Kurafire

Who has been, in the past, your major role model, idol or source of inspiration?

#### Robert Jordan

I think I’m going to surprise you. I don’t know... if I have a role model or inspiration as a writer. The people who have had the most influence on my writing would be Jane Austin, Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Lewey Lamore, and John. D. McDonnel.
