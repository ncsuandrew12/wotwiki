# [Interview #643, Entry #2]: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#2)

#### Kurafire

Has the Fantasy genre always been your favorite genre to read? Is it now?

#### Robert Jordan

No. I have no favorite genre to read, nor have I ever. I read any book that I think is good, in
*almost*
any genre. I mean I don’t read romance novels. Simply the fact that a book is supposed to be a good book, is enough for me to consider reading it. And maybe if I decide it
*isn’t*
a good book, it is
*not*
worth reading it. I’ll try anything; fiction, non-fiction...
