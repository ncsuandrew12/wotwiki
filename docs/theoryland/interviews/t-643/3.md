# [Interview #643: Elf Fantasy Fair Interview with Robert Jordan - Kurafire, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=643#3)

#### Kurafire

You've learned to read at a very young age, and the books you read weren't children's books either. Do you think that this is what caused you to become an author in the long run?

#### Robert Jordan

Uhm, I don’t think it caused me to become an author. I must say I prefer writer. I write, I don’t 'author'. I think that they’re synchronous things. Or perhaps, both indicative of the same thing about me. I didn’t become a writer because I read early, any more than I read early because I was going to become a writer. I am the kind of person who would become a writer [...] and that kind of person is, I think, perhaps someone who reads early, who gathers inspiration for books.
