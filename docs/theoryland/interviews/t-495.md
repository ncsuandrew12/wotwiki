## Entry #1

#### Brandon Sanderson

In the most recent Mistborn 3 annotations, I discuss
[Vin's defense before Yomen](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/333/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Sixty-Part-2)
and
[what happened to Janarle](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/334/Mistborn-3-Chapter-Sixty-One)
. And in this week's Writing Excuses podcast, Dan, Howard, James Dashner, and I take questions from the crowd at LTU&E, covering a variety of topics.

## Entry #2

#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Gathering Storm*
[was named as one of five nominees](http://www.audiopub.org/2010 finalists.pdf)
for the 2010 Audie awards in the category of science fiction/fantasy audiobook. Kudos to voice performers Michael Kramer and Kate Reading! If you haven't had a chance to give the Wheel of Time audiobooks a try, I highly recommend them.

## Entry #3

#### Brandon Sanderson

Now for this week's big news (though this is fighting with the Audies as far as how big it is).
*The Gathering Storm*
is on the long list of titles up for the David Gemmell Legend award (
*Warbreaker*
is also on the list, but I feel that
*The Gathering Storm*
is more in the spirit of Gemmell's work, which is part of the award's criteria).
*Hero of Ages*
made the short list last year and lost to
*Blood of Elves*
, and I was just honored to be nominatedâ€”until I found out that the winner gets a
*freaking battleaxe*
.

The award itself is in the shape of a Druss-style battleaxe, and it is awesome. If you want to help me and Team Jordan win one of these for
*The Gathering Storm*
. . . or rather, if you believe it's the most deserving of the books that have been nominated, go
[vote for the David Gemmell Legend Award here](http://gemmellaward.ning.com/page/vote-for-the-legend-here)
. (I won't feel bad if you vote for something else.)
