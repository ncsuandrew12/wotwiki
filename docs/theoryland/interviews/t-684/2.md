# [Interview #684: Robert Jordan gives insight into NEW SPRING, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=684#2)

#### Robert Jordan

The trip to Europe went very well. I was at the Hungarian Book Fair in Budapest and the Turin Book Fair in Italy, both good experiences, and Harriet and I got a chance to do some sight seeing, too. No fish in Ireland, though; the weather was rainy, windy, and twenty degrees colder than expected this time of year, so nothing was biting.

*New Spring*
is coming along nicely. There's nothing new to report there, but I do want to emphasize that this is not an expansion in the way that Scott Card's
*Ender's Game*
was. The story will begin some months earlier, there are more plot lines (putting in things I had to drop to make the novella length) and more detail. In short, it will be the story the way I wanted to tell it in the beginning, before I realized that that would mean seventy-thousand words, give or take.
