# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#6)

#### Tim Kington

My friend Josh and I had been talking about how Rand and Mat spent a week in Rhuidean, and so he asked how long Mat was hanging.

#### Robert Jordan

Long enough.

#### JOSH

Long enough for what?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Long enough to be ALMOST dead.

#### TIM KINGTON

(Emphasis mine) I was pretty sure this was where Mat died and lived again, but I guess that's out of the question now.
