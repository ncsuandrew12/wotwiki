# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan showed up around 7, and gave a little speech. He said there will be at least two books, and that he will not write a word more than he has to. He talked a little bit about what his next series will be, which he is calling Shipwrecked or Fantasy Shogun for now. I got the impression that he would like to finish WOT so that he can start writing the next thing already. He said he has known the last scene of the last book since 1984.
