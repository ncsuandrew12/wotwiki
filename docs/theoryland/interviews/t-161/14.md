# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#14)

#### Robert Jordan

He listens to music while he writes. Usually classical, but also ethnic music occasionally. When he's not writing he likes jazz and old-style country. He also likes the latest music from Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson now that they don't care what people think any more.
