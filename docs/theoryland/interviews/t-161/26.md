# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#26)

#### Question

Is the world of the books another world?

#### Robert Jordan

The intention is that the world of the books is our world at a different time. The conceit is that time is a wheel, so if you go far enough into our future or into our past, you come to the time in the books. Because of that, they have legends that originate in our time, and we have legends that originate in theirs.
