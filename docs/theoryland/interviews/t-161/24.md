# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #24](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#24)

#### Question

When Rand went to see the rebels in
*A Crown of Swords*
, and Fain was there, why didn't Rand just waste him and gate out of there?

#### Robert Jordan

When Rand visits the rebels, he has a specific goal in mind. He's just been to see the Sea Folk, and things have gone his way there, so he's going to see what the Dragon Reborn can do about the rebels. Killing an advisor and Traveling away is not going to help him accomplish his goals. He's not a fool.
