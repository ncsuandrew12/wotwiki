# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#3)

#### Robert Jordan

Then he said that someone has figured out who killed Asmodean. My impression was that it was in a letter someone sent him. He said that he didn't tell the person he was right, and he's not going to tell us who it is because he enjoys watching us squirm. He said that if we would have figured it out a few books ago, he probably would have told us, but now he's having too much fun. He also said that the guy used only clues that were available in the first five books to do it. He then thought for a moment and said he may have used one or two things from later books.
