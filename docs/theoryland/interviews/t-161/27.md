Yes, the Champion of the Light has gone over in the past. This is a game you have to win every time. Or rather, that you can only lose onceâ€”you can stay in if you get a draw. Think of a tournament with single elimination. If you lose once, that's it. In the past, when the Champion of the Light has gone over to the Shadow, the result has been a draw.
