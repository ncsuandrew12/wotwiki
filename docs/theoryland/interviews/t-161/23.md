# [Interview #161, Entry #23]: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#23)

#### Question

Is Olver Gaidal Cain?

#### Robert Jordan

No. I didn't really think that this would last as long as it has. The timing is wrong. He has
[another reason for being there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_Roland)
besides being a red herring, though.

#### QUESTION

He's too old.

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Yes. Time in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
and the real world run at different rates, but it never runs backwards. You may spend an hour in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
, and a day has passed when you get back, or you may spend a day, and an hour has passed when you get back, but you'll never go in on Tuesday and come back on Monday.

#### QUESTION

Is the difference in time constant?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

No. It's fairly random. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes the same as real time.

#### QUESTION

It's different for different people, then?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Yes. Unless they're together in
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. Then the same amount of time passes for them obviously.
