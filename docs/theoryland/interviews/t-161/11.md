# [Interview #161: COT Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=161#11)

#### Question

Someone asked about how he writes women so well.

#### Robert Jordan

When he was a teenager, he didn't have much luck with women despite being very pretty. He mentioned this to his uncle, and he said, "You like to hunt deer, don't you?" "Yes." "You know a lot about deer?" "Yes." "You know their habits, when they get up, where they like to forage, what trails they tend to follow, etc.?" "Yes." "Well, do you think that hunting deer is more important than hunting women?" So he started to study women.
