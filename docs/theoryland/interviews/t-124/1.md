# [Interview #124: WH Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=124#1)

#### John Nowacki

Regarding this evening's signing at Tower Books in Richmond:

The crowd was not very large, perhaps 50-75 people.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ showed up right at seven, and tried to head off some of the more common questionsâ€”he pronounced several names, made the usual remarks about knowing the last scene for the past fifteen years, said that even the most cursory reading ought to indicate who killed Asmodean (and that he enjoys people trying to figure it out), and that there will be at least three more books. He also said it would be fine for people to take pictures, but that "no male nudity" would be permitted. He said something to that effect at the DC signing two years ago, as well . . . a matter of great concern, apparently.
