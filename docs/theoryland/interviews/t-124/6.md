# [Interview #124: WH Signing Report - John Nowacki, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=124#6)

#### John Nowacki

Since I had to drive back to Fairfax, I left at 7:30 and didn't catch any more answers. I did talk to a few people there, but only one of them was familiar with this group.

That's it.
