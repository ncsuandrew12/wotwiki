# [Interview #510, Entry #16]: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#16)

#### Richard Fife

I instantly got my hand up and asked Harriet the same question I had just asked Maria [about how Moiraine learned balefire], even prefacing that Maria had not RAFO'd me, but instead given me a vague-ish non-answer.

#### Harriet McDougal Rigney

Harrietâ€™s reply was, "I can be very vague too when I want to be." She then had Brandon give me a RAFO card, that I then had her sign after the panel.
