# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #21](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#21)

#### Maria Simons

The
*Towers of Midnight*
panel should have been subtitled "Maria says nothing." She actually went in with a thick stack of RAFO cards and handed them out liberally. Jakob Ro was again moderating, though, and discussion amongst the audience was fine indeed.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Also, Brandon poked his head and smiled as we talked. Finally we all turned to him, and he said that all he could say is that any characters you didn't see much of in
*The Gathering Storm*
get more face time in
*Towers of Midnight*
. He then disappeared.

#### Richard Fife

What was somewhat sad, though, was that in the panel, almost no one really cared to talk about Perrin, and the few that did only got to in moments aside from the main discussion. People were far more interested in Mat and the Tower of Ghenjei, Lan and Malkier, The Black Tower (which someone claimed Brandon had mentioned at a signing that he didnâ€™t know if it would make it into the book), and pretty well anyone but Perrin. As I said: poor Perrin.
