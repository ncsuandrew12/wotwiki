# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#8)

#### Richard Fife

Anyway, after that panel, I started my grand scheme. What is that scheme? Well, I'll tell you now: I got one-on-one interviews with all of Team Jordan, as well as Larry Mondragon from Red Eagle Entertainment (the production company for the movies and video games). So, be on the look out for those posts in the coming days. And, remember, I am telling you that you are getting those posts, so as you read this, don't panic. There is your warning.
