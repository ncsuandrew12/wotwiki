# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #14](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#14)

#### Richard Fife

There was also some question on how she [Moiraine] learned Balefire and after the panel I talked to Maria about it a little more hush-hush, in particular asking her if it was possible to learn weaves from text.

#### Maria Simons

The vague non-answer I got was not a
[RAFO](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_does_Robert_Jordan_mean_by_rafo)
, but Maria "feels" that one can get hints from text that could lead to one figuring it out. When I plied a little deeper, asking if there was a graphical means, perhaps, for weaves to be recorded, she declined from answering either way (but still not a full RAFO). I then left the panel and interviewed Red Eagle Entertainment. Twice. It was double-fun.
