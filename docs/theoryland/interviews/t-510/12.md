# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#12)

#### Wilson Grooms

I got off registration and dodged getting drafted for crowd control at the Brandon Sanderson signing so I could get mall—Japanese for lunch—my only meal of the day, I might add. I then hurried back and had my interview with Wilson, where he did two things he professed hating to do: talk about his cousin and do so at length. Actually, he hates neither of those things. The interview was fun.
