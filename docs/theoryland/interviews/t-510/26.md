# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #26](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#26)

#### Richard Fife

Coda: Monday

As with last year, I am amazed by what has sprung forth from the Wheel of Time. Entire communities that use the books as a focus for charitable work, vast discussion and role-playing sites, and a fan base that could make the second year of this convention just as amazing a success as the first. The care, dedication, and fascination the fans, myself included, have with this series is a powerful testament, and I can only wish that Robert Jordan was still with us to see it today. But, I guess in a fashion, he is. So long as his works are loved, the Great Bard will always, at least in spirit, live on. Thank you,
[Age of Legends](http://www.jordancon.org/)
, for putting this on, and, wherever you are, thank you too, Robert Jordan.
