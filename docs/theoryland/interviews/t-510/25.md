# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #25](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#25)

#### Richard Fife

I then enjoyed a little downtime while Larry from Red Eagle was at lunch. Funny story, that, actually. I had seen Larry the night previous and he was ten sorts of cool with redoing the interview. All Sunday, though, I kept just missing him, or he'd have a free moment, but I was busy with one of the other interviews. I finally managed to get his at 3:30 as the convention was winding down, and again, it came out even better than the first run. We shook hands, and I then went and made my goodbyes. I am somewhat sad that I missed all the panels on Sunday, especially the one entitled "The Codex" that was about the encyclopedia, but I can tell you that it is going to be more of an actual encyclopedia than the "Big White Book." Open the index, look up a word, and find the article on it. It won't tie up every loose end, but from what I gather, they are planning on telling us quite a bit. I left, tired but happy. I pulled into my driveway back in Wilmington, NC around midnight, made sure the recorder was safe, then crashed.
