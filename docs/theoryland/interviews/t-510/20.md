# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#20)

#### Richard Fife

So, after the reading, I sat down and did my interview with Brandon (of which one commenter in the
[*Path of Daggers*
part 1 reread](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/04/the-wheel-of-time-re-read-the-path-of-daggers-part-1)
, J. Dauro, actually got a picture). Yeah, I had an audience, but that actually just made it a little cooler. It was (wait for it) fun. I would just like to say here something that has been said before but that just needs repeated: Brandon is an amazing guy. When you have his attention, you have all of it, and he is really, truly engaged. I talked with him earlier at one point, and he actually started asking me questions about what I was doing here on Tor.com and what I was doing on my personal website, and I could tell he wasn't just being polite. Blew me away. Oh, I also got a picture taken for a friend.

After the interview, I went ahead and got changed into my suit for the semi-formal ball that was going on that night, as I wanted to attend the
*Towers of Midnight*
panel that was happening during the dinner break. I came back down and got to see the better part of the costume contest, which was won by a very well done Trolloc, head and height included, and also had a Greenman (height included), and some amazing Mats, Rands, Mins, Moiraines, Asha'man, Warders, and Aes Sedai. Oddly, I don't think there was a single Perrin. Poor Perrin. Still, it amazes me how detailed these costumes can be, yet we still all recognize them. Just says something about how those details Jordan was fond of have really stuck with us.
