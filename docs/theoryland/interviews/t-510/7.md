# [Interview #510: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#7)

#### Brandon Sanderson

We also got a few comments on
*Towers of Midnight*
, in particular the following: like most Robert Jordan book names, the meaning of "Towers of Midnight" is twofoldâ€”it is a real place or thing in the world, and it is also a metaphor for what is going on. So while the Towers are part of the Seanchan government, there will be other "Towers of Midnight" metaphorically speaking. He also informed us that the book is sitting around 310,000 words right now, and while he has some more to write, he expects the final draft will be right around that length too. As far as I can tell, he is still hopeful for the release, although it might (big might!) get moved back to November. He will try to make sure it doesn't get bumped back to February, which is the next month something would come out since December and January are just bad months to release books.
