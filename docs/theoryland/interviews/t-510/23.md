# [Interview #510, Entry #23]: Recap of JordanCon II - Richard Fife](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=510#23)

#### Richard Fife

Aside from that, the Seanchan Homecoming Ball was pretty fun. Jendayi Bellydancing entertained us, there was an informal costume contest for the "Homecoming King and Queen," a series of filked Wheel of Time songs (both lyrics and music original) that were highly entertaining, and a DJ that let people dance into the morning. The silent auction also raised $2,320 all told. I don't really want to say how much of that was me, although the cane/staff was oddly the second highest bidded item. The book out-stripped it. I'd imagine this was because it started at a lower initial bid, so more people got invested faster. Oh, and apparently the DJ Rickroll'd the room for the last song (I was already gone). Still, everyone somehow managed to blame me. I'm innocent, I say!

The night wound down with me sitting around chatting with Paul and cradling my new friend in my arm, and I actually managed to fall into my bed around midnight, still worried over my lost ninety minutes of interviews but hopeful.
