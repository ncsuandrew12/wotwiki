## [Entry #1](./t-1111/1)

#### tganchero

(Brandon mentioned changing Kaladin's plot so that he chose the "hard" path) What was the hard path?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Kaladin initially accepted the shardblade and plate in the first book, and the rest of the book was about him fighting with them. Really boring.

## [Entry #2](./t-1111/2)

#### tganchero

Are highstorms a meteorological or magical phenomenon?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both.

## [Entry #3](./t-1111/3)

#### tganchero

Did the mistress from the interlude in book 1 destroy the Shalash statue on the night of Gavilar's death?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, and also all the other ones that we've seen, including the one in Shallan's vision in Words of Radiance.
Q: Is the mistress Shalash?
A: RAFO.

#### Footnote

This mistress was confirmed to be Shalash herself.

## [Entry #4](./t-1111/4)

#### tganchero

How many oaths can a Radiant swear?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There is an upper-limit/threshold to the number of oaths a Radiant may make. By the end of WoR, Shallan is a step higher than Kaladin.

## [Entry #5](./t-1111/5)

#### tganchero

No specific question.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not completely sure on this one: He said that at one point Shallan may have said all the oaths for her order (or may have been capable of saying all of the oaths by the end of the book) but has since regressed due to "memory loss/repression."
Regarding Dalinar: He said that Dalinar has had a bond with the Stormfather "for a while." He also only said one oath at the top of the Urithiru tower, not two. Dalinar conveyed a single idea in that particular oath.
Brandon also clarified that the oaths, with the exception of the first ideal, are not restricted to specific words. Rather, a specific idea must be conveyed for the oath to be accepted.

## [Entry #6](./t-1111/6)

#### gpmushu

Do darkeyes feel the Thrill?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes.

## [Entry #7](./t-1111/7)

#### gpmushu

Do highstorms get weaker as they move west because of normal meteorological reasons the same way a hurricane gets weaker over land or is it because they slowly drain investiture as they infuse spheres over the whole continent?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Both. He said that anything like that will be affected by both normal science as well as the magic, but then he added that the highstorms are a natural occurring phenomenon that were on the planet before stuff started going down. I didn't get this confirmed, but I think he meant the stormlight part of the storm was added later, I'm assuming by a Shard.

## [Entry #8](./t-1111/8)

#### gpmushu

Has the Thrill existed longer than the Death Rattles or have they both been occurring for about the same period of time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The Thrill and the Death Rattles started around the same time, but the locations for the two fluctuate and have been since they appeared.

#### Footnote

This note is from the forums: (This is just a way of confirming that the Unmade have been active for about the same amount of time. Both started around the time Gavilar started to explore the Shattered Plains according to Taravangian.)
