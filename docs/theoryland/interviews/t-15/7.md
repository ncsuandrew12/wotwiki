# [Interview #15: Letter to Tom McCormick, Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#7)

#### Question

Ask him if he knows about all the Jordan junkies on the network. Tell him we love his books and are frenzied to know when the next one is coming out. Get him to confirm that Verin is not Black. (Not that he will of course; then again, those of us who know, know that she isn't.) Please find out if Lews Therin balefired himself in the prologue in
*The Eye of the World*
, or if he just drew too much of the One Power. If it isn't critical to the continuing plot, I'm sure he'll say.

#### Robert Jordan

I know about the "Jordan junkies" (ahem! Blush!), now. Lews Therin did not use balefire on himself; he simply drew as much of the One Power as he could, then kept on pulling it in. As for Verin: read and find out. Surely you agree with Oscar Wilde about the suspense? I will try to keep you right a tiptoe as long as I can.
