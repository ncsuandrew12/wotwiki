# [Interview #15, Entry #2]: Letter to Tom McCormick](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#2)

#### Robert Jordan

I found the compendium fascinating. It is startling how much your group has puzzled out correctly, but I have to tell you that some of what you worked out is wrong, concerning both me and the books, but I have it in mind not to tell you which parts. That way you can have the pleasure of figuring out for yourselves where you went astray. (Easy to say that when I'm four or five thousand miles away.)

#### Footnote

RJ is speaking of an early version of the FAQ.
