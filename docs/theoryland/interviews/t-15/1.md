# [Interview #15: Letter to Tom McCormick, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#1)

#### Tom McCormick

Hi there,

Well here's my story, back in November I sent an email to the SF-Lovers asking if anybody had any questions they wanted Robert Jordan author of the Wheel of Time asked as I was going to a book signing of his, here in Glasgow.

However to my dismay, I discovered I couldn't make it to the book signing in the afternoon, so I typed a small letter to Robert Jordan explaining my situation and including a list of the questions which I had received via the internet, asking if he could possibly answer the questions at his leisure. I also give him a copy of the Wheel of Time FAQ which I had received via email and which I had printed and bound.

A couple of weeks later I received a reply.

I would have emailed this response to SF-Lovers sooner however my rights to the network had been restricted, however my position has now changed and what follows is the questions I posed then the letter he sent me.
