# [Interview #15: Letter to Tom McCormick, Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#6)

#### Question

In
*The Fires of Heaven*
, in the chapters "The Far Snows" and "A Short Spear," was the timing of events deliberately precalculated by him, or not? If the first is true, I'm not asking for an explanationâ€”presumably we'll get that in a later book. I'm just asking for a yes or a no. (If he wants to know why the question was put, please just say the two words "time zones.")

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, the timing was calculated. I know how far to the west Seanchan lies.
