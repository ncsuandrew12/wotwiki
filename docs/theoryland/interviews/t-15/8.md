# [Interview #15, Entry #8]: Letter to Tom McCormick](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#8)

#### Question

We don't want to pry; however it was rumored that you had suffered a heart attack recently and your devoted readers are concerned for your welfare.

#### Robert Jordan

No, I did not have a heart attack, nor any sort of medical problem whatsoever. My wife did have heart surgery, she has made a full recovery; this may be the source of the rumors. Many thanks for your concern.
