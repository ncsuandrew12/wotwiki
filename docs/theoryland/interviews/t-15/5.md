#### Question

Do you currently think it will be seven or eight books total, also will the books continue to remain as 'chunky' as
*The Fires of Heaven*
and
*The Shadow Rising*
?

#### Robert Jordan

At present I am indeed hoping to complete the cycle in either seven or eight books. I am 90% confident that I can do it in seven, 95% confident that I can by eight. The thing is, as a famous manager of an American baseball team once said: "It ain't over till it's over." I know the last scene of the last book and the resolutions of all the major story lines. I have known these things since the very beginning. It is just a matter of getting there. And I am afraid the rest of the books very likely will be as large as
*Shadow*
and
*Fires*
. Sorry. I've been thinking about asking the publisher to include a shoulder strap. At least I haven't topped a thousand pages in hardcover yet.
