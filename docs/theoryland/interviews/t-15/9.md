# [Interview #15, Entry #9]: Letter to Tom McCormick](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=15#9)

#### Question

What is the name of the next book, and will Perrin be in it a bit more than in
*The Fires of Heaven*
?

#### Robert Jordan

*Lord of Chaos*
is the title of number six at present. A working title, but I like it. As for Perrin, he will definitely be back sooner or later.
