# [Interview #468: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #13](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#13)

#### Question

In Falme we saw Rand fighting Ishamael and the Heroes of the Horn and the Seanchan were mirroring the progress of the battle. Does this mean that there is something inherently evil about the Seanchan Empire?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Nobody in WoT is inherently evil, except for Shadowspawn. At the time, the Seanchan were being led by a Darkfriend.
