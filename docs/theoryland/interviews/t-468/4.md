# [Interview #468, Entry #4]: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#4)

#### Question

Was Taim turned by a circle of thirteen?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. I will say that he was never a very nice guy.

#### Footnote

It was made clear in
*Towers of Midnight*
that it's difficult to mistake someone who has been Turned for a normal person. They are uniformly inhuman, and this explains why they have not been Turning channelers all along; it is clear there is something wrong with them.
