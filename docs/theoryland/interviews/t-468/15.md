#### Question

Is Mesaana still in the Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Egwene makes some deductions about this at the end of the book. Egwene is not incorrect.

#### Question

She could swear that she's not a Darkfriend on the Oath Rod, right?

#### Brandon Sanderson

As long as she believed it to be true. Every remaining Aes Sedai in the Tower has retaken the Three Oaths. You should be thinking about ways to defeat the Oath Rod. There is a way to do it.
