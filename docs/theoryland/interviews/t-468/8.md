#### Question

Will Moiraine be rescued in the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that Moiraine will be rescued.

#### Question

Will Moiraine's rescue attempt be in the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that Thom and Mat will attempt to rescue Moiraine. (I'll tell you, he's as bad as an Aes Sedai.)

#### Question

What will be the focus of the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

This book really needed to focus on Egwene and Rand, and get their stories moving. There was also a nice contrast between their arcs in this book, with Egwene's going upwards and Rand's downward. The next book will be much broader in scopeâ€”we need to see what's going on with a lot of different parts of the story. There will be a lot more Mat and Perrin than in this one. I suppose you could say that if there was going to be a rescue attempt, the logical place to put it would be in a book with a lot of Mat.
