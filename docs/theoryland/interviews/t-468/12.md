# [Interview #468: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#12)

#### Question

After Rand has channeled the True Power, he has a dark cloud around him. When he meets with Tuon after this, she manages to resist his
*ta'veren*
pull. Is this because the True Power has reduced his
*ta'veren*
mojo?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The reason she manages to resist is that she has a lot of willpower. Rand is just as
*ta'veren*
as ever.

#### Question

How about the food going bad in Bandar Eban? Was that caused by Rand being nearby with his cloud of evil?

#### Brandon Sanderson

We've heard earlier in the books that the Dragon is one with the land, and the land is one with the Dragon. This is an old beliefâ€”many kingdoms believed that the wellness of the king was directly tied to the wellness of the land. In WoT, this is quite literally true.
