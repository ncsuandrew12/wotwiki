# [Interview #468: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#5)

#### Question

Slayer made a gateway in Far Madding when he tried to kill Rand and Min. Does this mean he uses the True Power to make his gateways?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Slayer does not channel. His powers come from somewhere other than the Source. Slayer is not affected by the Guardian in much the same way that Perrin wouldn't be.

#### Footnote

Slayer didn't make a gateway; he just 'stepped out' of
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
. The person who gave his orders did make a gateway, to
*Tel'aran'rhiod*
.
