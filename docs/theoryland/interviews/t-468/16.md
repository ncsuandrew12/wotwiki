# [Interview #468, Entry #16]: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#16)

#### Question

At the Darkfriend Social, Carridin is given orders by Ishamael that he can't remember. Later on in Ebou Dar, he sees Mat out the window and he sort of goes into a trance, sees more imagery, and when he snaps out of it, time is stopped and Sammael is in the room. How did this happen? Was Sammael paged somehow when Carridin's orders were triggered?

#### Brandon Sanderson

MAFO—Maria and find out. This means he will answer the question, but he wants to check with Maria first to make sure he has the details straight.

No, Sammael was not paged. Sammael had sent Carridin to Ebou Dar to find the cache of Power goodies. The notes say that Sammael became aware that there were other parties engaged in the same search, and decided that he had to light a fire under Carridin. Also note Sammael’s reaction to the news that Mat is in Ebou Dar—"'Here?" Oddly, for a moment, Sammael seemed taken aback". It seems to accentuate that Sammael is surprised; if he had been paged, it seems that his answer would have been different.
