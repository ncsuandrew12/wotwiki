#### Question

Will Fain be in the next book?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Padan Fain will be seen again. He's a mixture of two thingsâ€”Mordeth's power, which he got by seeking out all of the evil things that weren't related to the Shadow, and the Dark One's Hound. Brandon said that Fain's number one goal is to kill Rand, and a close second is to kill the Dark One. Now that Shadar Logoth has been destroyed, all of the Mordeth power that remains in the world is in Fain.
