#### Question

After Moiraine uses balefire on the Darkhounds in
*The Dragon Reborn*
, she says something about how she's much more dangerous now than when she met Perrin in Emond's Field. How did she become more dangerous?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are a couple of ways she might mean that she has become more dangerous. Think about thisâ€”when she went to Emond's Field, she thought Rand was the Dragon. Now she knows that he's the Dragon. That in itself, combined with the fact that she's Blue makes her much more dangerous.
