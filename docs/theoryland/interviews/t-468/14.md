# [Interview #468, Entry #14]: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#14)

#### Question

Was the Domination Band made of
*cuendillar*
?

#### Brandon Sanderson

The original one is made of
*cuendillar*
. The one that was destroyed was a copy, but one would assume that the copies are made of
*cuendillar*
, too. The True Power works by destroying the Pattern. Everything that is done with it involves damage to the Pattern. For example, when we see Ishamael Travel, he does so by poking a hole in the Pattern.
*Cuendillar*
can be destroyed using the True Power. There is another way to destroy
*cuendillar*
, too.

#### Footnote

Brandon said in
[another interview](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=632#10)
that the second way
*cuendillar*
can be destroyed is by the unraveling Pattern.
