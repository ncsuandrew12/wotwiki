# [Interview #468: TGS Signing Report - Tim Kington, Entry #11](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=468#11)

#### Question

It's pretty clear now that Moridin and Rand are linked because of the balefire incident. Since Rand used
*saidin*
to create the balefire, and now he gets sick when channeling
*saidin*
, does that mean Moridin gets sick when he tries to use the True Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

You're assuming that Rand's channeling sickness comes from crossing the streams.

#### Footnote

From
*Knife of Dreams*
Chapter 21, "Within the Stone":

> The face of the man from Shadar Logoth floated in his head for a moment. He looked furious. And near to sicking up.
