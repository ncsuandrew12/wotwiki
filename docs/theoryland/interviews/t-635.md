#### Brandon Sanderson

I'm in the middle of my tour for
*The Alloy of Law*
right now; I'm in Houston today and will be in London by Saturday. If you want email reminders when I'll be near you,
[sign up and tell me your city](http://brandonsanderson.com/contact/?topic=9)
. Meanwhile this year's
[Great Hunt](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1032/New-Wheel-of-Time-Great-Hunt)
continues, and readers have gone a long way toward deciphering the

from Robert Jordan's notes.

## [Entry #2](./t-635/2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

By the way,
*The Alloy of Law*
was one of five write-in candidates to be added in its category as a
[2011 Goodreads Choice Award semifinalist](http://www.goodreads.com/award/choice/2011#56596-Best-Fantasy)
. If you think it deserves the award, you can vote for it
[here](http://www.goodreads.com/award/choice/2011#56596-Best-Fantasy)
. Competition is pretty stiff, though!

## [Entry #3](./t-635/3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This week's Writing Excuses episode features Andrew P. Mayer joining Howard, Mary, and Dan at Dragon\*Con to discuss taking
[ridiculous-seeming over-the-top concepts](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/1034/ALLOY-illustrations-Blood-and-Bloody-Ashes-Shirt--Updates)
and using them to create brilliant literature.

In the newest chapter of
*Mythwalker*
, my abandoned novel from 2001,
[the switch is on](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/133/Warbreaker-Prime-Mythwalker-Chapter-Thirteen)
. You knew it was coming.

## [Entry #4](./t-635/4)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yesterday on Twitter I participated in a
[#torchat](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23torchat?q=%23torchat)
. The first half of it is also up in my newest
[Twitter archive post](http://brandonsanderson.com/article/92/Tweets-October-31-November-14-2011)
, and I'll put up the rest next week.

## [Entry #5](./t-635/5)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Several readers have reported that the ebook version of
*The Alloy of Law*
has images that are hard to read. Tor is working on a solution right now, but in the meantime, I've uploaded all of the images to their own page
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/The-Alloy-of-Law/page/66/The-Alloy-of-Law-Interior-Illustrations)
. You can see them below. I'm including a color version of the Elendel city map (by Isaac Stewart, who also runs the
*Mistborn*
and
*Stormlight Archive*
[T-shirt store](http://store.inkwing.com/)
) that doesn't appear in the book. And you can download a
[full-resolution broadsheet PDF](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/mistborn-fans-dont-forget-to-pick-up-todays-edition-of-the-elendel-daily)
if you are a Tor.com member. By the way, broadsheet (and Shallan's sketchbook) artist
[Ben McSweeney](http://inkthinker.net/)
will be with me at my Houston signing today, so fortunate readers there can get his autograph as well.

## [Entry #6](./t-635/6)

#### Brandon Sanderson

[Ta'veren Tees](http://taverentees.com/)
has a new T-shirt available for preorder. I think I'll let it speak for itself.
