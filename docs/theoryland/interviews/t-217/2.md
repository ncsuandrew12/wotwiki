# [Interview #217: KOD Signing Report - Basri, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=217#2)

#### Question

Someone else mentioned how they liked the way he writes political figures as self-interested people who truly believe they are doing whatever is right for the common good.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ agreed with this and said that that's what he believes the vast majority of politicians are like. There are of course some who are corrupt. He then told a story of a frightening meeting with a man (I forget the name) who was ex-KGB and connected to powerful Russian politicians and liked his books, who then asked RJ how he knows what he knows. A sweating RJ then told the man they first had to agree on what it is that he knows.
