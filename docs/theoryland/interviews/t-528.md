Hi all, Brandon's assistant Peter here. He's off on his tour (Thursday's stop is in the Chicago area), so he doesn't have a lot of time to update the blog. He did write one blog post ahead of time, which I'll post tomorrow probably. And you can keep track of his progress on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
.

Brandon wanted me to give everyone an update on the promotion for
*Towers of Midnight*
that Brandon & Tor are doing in conjunction with the
*The Way of Kings*
tour. (The book, by the way, was just announced today as having hit #7 on the
*New York Times*
bestseller list to be released in ten days or so. Congrats, Brandon!) This promotion is being called The Great Hunt; Brandon is dropping clues in every stop on his tour that will slowly reveal more of the encrypted text
[found here](http://brandonsanderson.com/thegreathunt)
. As I write this, 17 clues have been found or guessed outright. Brandon wanted me to list the clues and who found them, but . . . why should I duplicate effort? ;) Terez from
[Theoryland](http://theoryland.com/)
is already doing a great job at exactly that. So I suggest you
[pop over to this page](https://docs.google.com/View?docID=dcjspjqg_881z2xd56fn&revision=_latest)
if you want a roundup of all clues currently found or guessed. Brandon also adds more information more or less daily on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson)
and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BrandonSandrson)
.

There are a few other updates for me to get to.
[*Warbreaker*
annotations](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/book/Warbreaker)
have been continuing. (Brandon wrote these before the book was even published, and I have a number of them queued for release every Tuesday and Thursday.) The newest annotations cover a lot of stuff in chapters
[seven](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/382/Warbreaker-Chapter-Seven)
,
[eight](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/383/Warbreaker-Chapter-Eight)
,
[nine](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/384/Warbreaker-Chapter-Nine)
,
[ten](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/385/Warbreaker-Chapter-Ten)
, and
[eleven](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/386/Warbreaker-Chapter-Eleven)
such as Siri meeting the God King, Blushweaver's character origin, Vivenna's viewpoints, and Parlin.

Two more Writing Excuses podcast episodes went up. Brandon, Dan, and Howard first
[answer audience questions on a number of writing-related topics](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/08/29/)
, and then talk about the
[won a Parsec award](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/09/07/>third-person limited viewpoint</a>. On another note, the podcast has once again <a href=)
, presented this past weekend at Dragon\*Con. Last year when it won, none of the three hosts were at Dragon\*Con, but this year two of them were there (Howard was at Worldcon losing the Hugo award again) and they still couldn't attend the ceremonyâ€”Brandon and Dan were both signing books at the Decatur Book Festival during that timeslot. Oops. I assume that the three will make some kind of official acceptance speech eventually, as they did last year. Thanks everyone for listening, and they hope you find the podcast helpful and not boring!
