#### Question

How are the plans for the tele-movie version of
*Eye of the World*
coming along?

#### Robert Jordan

So far, the contracts have been signed, and I know no more. NBC has purchased an option, and while I hope the series will be made, many more options are purchased than shows see the light of day.

#### Question

Have any actors been cast yet?

#### Robert Jordan

Not that I know of.

#### Question

I read a two year old interview on the web which had you say you could not see your series turn into movies; what changed your mind?

#### Robert Jordan

The words "mini-series" and "at least four hours and possibly six." I still donâ€™t see any way that one of the books could be pared down enough to fit into the usual two-hour theatrical release, but four or six hours makes a difference.

#### Question

When are you hoping this project will be broadcast in the U.S. and will it be released on video/DVD?

#### Robert Jordan

I could wish for next week, but if wishes were wings, pigs would fly. I really have no idea as to the answer of either question.
