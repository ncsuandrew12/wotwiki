#### Question

Do you read fantasy yourself: and are you aware of the other fantasy writers out there?

#### Robert Jordan

Yes, I do. If anyone is looking, I suggest, in no particular order, John M. Ford, Isabelle Allende, Guy Gavriel Kay, C.S. Freidman, Barry Hughart, A.S. Byatt, Robert Holdstock, Tim Powers, Terry Pratchett, and George R.R. Martin. There really are too many excellent writers to list them all, or even come close, but these names are a start.

#### Question

If so would you want to work with any in the future?

#### Robert Jordan

I’ve never really thought of collaborating with anyone. It might happen, I suppose, but it just hasn’t occurred to me.
