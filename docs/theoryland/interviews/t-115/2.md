#### Question

Did you enjoy your time in New Zealand and will you be back?

I enjoyed my visit to New Zealand tremendously, and I certainly hope to return. New Zealand is the most beautiful country Iâ€™ve ever seen, and on top of that, I hope to return at the right time of year to do some serious trout fishing.
