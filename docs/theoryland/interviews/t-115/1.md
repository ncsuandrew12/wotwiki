# [Interview #115, Entry #1]: New Zealand Email Interview](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=115#1)

#### Michael Brunton

August of last year Robert Jordan was in New Zealand. At that stage I was asked if I wanted an interview with him which I gave a big yes. Trouble was we could not match up for a face to face interview so I went for the next best thing: one via e-mail. This interview took place early March.
