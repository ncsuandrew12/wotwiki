#### Therese Littleton

Is it ever hard for you to write?

#### Robert Jordan

No... it's hard for me not to write. I'm on tour, so I don't have time to write, but I have my computer with me because maybe I'll have time. Maybe. And the notion that I would have the time and not be able to work is horrifying.
