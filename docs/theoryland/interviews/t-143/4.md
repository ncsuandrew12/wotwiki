#### Therese Littleton

There are a lot of battles, wars, and great conflicts in your books. Did your military experiences influence that part of your writing?

#### Robert Jordan

To some extent, but mainly the thing that comes out of my experiences in the military is that I know what it's like when someone is trying to kill you. And I know that being in a battle is confusion. You know what you can see; you don't know what is happening beyond your sight. That's what comes from the military. To tell you the truth, the battles aren't nearly as interesting as the people. I like the interactions of the peopleâ€”the character development, the way people play off one another.
