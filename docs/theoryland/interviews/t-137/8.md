#### Dragon Theif [sic]

Is it possible for two souls to inhabit one body at the same time without the aid of the Dark One's powers?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Obvious :D .

#### Footnote

This question was asked because
[some people](http://www.theoryland.com/factions.php?func=4&rec=31)
at Theoryland believed that Rand and Lews Therin were separate souls.
