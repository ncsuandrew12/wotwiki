#### Gonzo the Great

Did Demandred recognise Flinn in the last chapter of
*Winter's Heart*
?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Naturally :( .

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Would Taim have recognised Flinn, in that position?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

Yes.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Not expected, but not helpful either because of [the previous answer].

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Did you intend in
*Winter's Heart*
to make it clear that Demandred is not Taim?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

RAFO.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Obvious :D .
