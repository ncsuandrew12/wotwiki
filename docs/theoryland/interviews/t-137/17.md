# [Interview #137: Elf Fantasy Fair - Gonzo, Entry #17](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=137#17)

#### Robert Jordan

Sammael is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He may be reborn again, but then he will not remember he was Sammael. He cannot be reincarnated. He is dead.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

To me, this suggests that we will not see Sammael again.
