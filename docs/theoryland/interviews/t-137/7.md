#### Gonzo the Great

I noticed that only men use the phrase 'so-called', while only women use 'who called themselves'. Is that a coincidence, or is it intentional?

#### Robert Jordan

Coincidence.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

Three down. This is not going well.

#### Footnote

Gonzo is confused since women use the phrase 'so-called' quite a bit.
