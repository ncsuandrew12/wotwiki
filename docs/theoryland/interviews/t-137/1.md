# [Interview #137: Elf Fantasy Fair - Gonzo, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=137#1)

#### Gonzo the Great

Not all the questions were asked, but I have repeated all of them, with (wherever applicable) the answers we received. Some of these things refer to
*Winter's Heart*
, so there are some spoilers in here. I do not think they are too bad, and I am sure most of this is interesting to everyone, so I will post it here and let you decide to stop reading if you do not want to get any information before you have finished that book.
