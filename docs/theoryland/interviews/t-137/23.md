# [Interview #137: Elf Fantasy Fair - Gonzo, Entry #23](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=137#23)

#### Gonzo the Great

Final result:
  
Three down, two RAFOs I expected, one idea badly damaged, and two as I told everyone was the case. All in all, I got a bit over 50 percent, and that is not as bad as I feared after the first few. ;)

PSâ€”Isabela, did you get anything more? I think you asked even more questions than I did, so you should have some more answers. I must admit, before you start mentioning irrelevant details, that I stole some of your answers for this post. But I had given fair warning, so that doesn't count. :)
