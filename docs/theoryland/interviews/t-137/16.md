# [Interview #137, Entry #16]: Elf Fantasy Fair - Gonzo](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=137#16)

#### Gonzo the Great

A few more, possibly interesting, remarks and answers we got:

#### Robert Jordan

Being burned out is different from being stilled. The latter is not as severe as the former.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

This is just as I expected, or at least in no way in contrast with it. :)
