# [Interview #137, Entry #22]: Elf Fantasy Fair - Gonzo](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=137#22)

#### Isabel

Can you eliminate anyone from the list of suspects in Asmodean's murder?

#### Robert Jordan

No. I like to see you wondering. It should be obvious to anyone.

#### Isabel

Not even a single one?

#### ROBERT JORDAN

(After some thinking): Rand. Apart from him, I will not clear any other suspects. Not even Bela.

#### GONZO THE GREAT

After this, it deteriorated into a discussion of Bela as the Creator/Moridin. Isabel defended my view that Moridin is Jeade'en, Rand's horse. For some reason, she failed to convince RJ; probably her fault, as my theory was very good. It was just my humility that made me stay in the background, of course. Certainly not the fact that I was not quite sure I could have defended it better.

#### Footnote

Gonzo's 'theory' derived from the prophecy which states that Rand will ride a horse named Death.
