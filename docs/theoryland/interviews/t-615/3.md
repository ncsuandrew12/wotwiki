#### Brandon Sanderson

Last week's Writing Excuses podcast episode covered
[Cyberpunk](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/07/10/)
. So this week Dan, Mary, Howard, and I do one of our

, in that genre.

This week's
[*Warbreaker*
annotation](http://brandonsanderson.com/annotation/437/Warbreaker-Chapter-Fifty-Seven)
