#### Brandon Sanderson

I had a great time at Polaris in Toronto this past weekend. If you couldn't be there, you can check out an mp3 of the Q&A session that I did, which

has posted online
[here](http://kiwi6.com/file/738gedlzct)
. (If you want to download it and can't figure out which link to use, it's the one that says "Download File 9.43 MB." Or you can just listen to it on that page.) If you haven't heard me tell the story of how Harriet first got in touch with me, this is a good medium. It also covers several other topics including
*Mistborn*
,
*The Way of Kings*
, etc.

I'll be flying out to San Diego in a couple of hours for Comic-Con. I posted
[my schedule](http://brandonsanderson.com/blog/998/)
in the last blog entry (I'll basically just be there on Thursday).
