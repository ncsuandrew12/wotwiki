[microcasting episodes](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/07/31/)
. Mary, Howard, Dan, and I fielded questions from people on Twitter and answered them briefly. We discussed the following topics:

> \* How do you hold the whole story in your head when it's a thousand pages long?
>   
> \* What steps do you use when creating a character?
>   
> \* As an outliner, when do you start putting in the details?
>   
> \* How do you patch plot holes?
>   
> \* How do you come up with names?
>   
> \* Is there one writing skill you'd like to get better at?
>   
> \* Writing groups: what do you look for?
