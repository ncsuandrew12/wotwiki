## [Entry #1](./t-665/1)

#### Robert Watson

Hi, There seems to have been much discussion about Randland size recently, and section (2.08) of the FAQ, "Geography of Randland" didn't have any info, so we (myself, Lara, and Greebs) took it upon ourselves to ask about this at the Vancouver signing (Friday 23rd).

#### Robert Jordan

From the Spine to the Aryth Ocean is 4-5000 miles; RJ compared Seanchan to the Americas, as one landmass. He made it clear that the Seanchan Empire is big.

## [Entry #2](./t-665/2)

#### Robert Jordan

Wouldn't say anything about Shara, of course, and Greebs' persistent efforts to get RJ to admit to the Oath Rod==Agelessness were met with a chuckle and a RAFO.

## [Entry #3](./t-665/3)

#### Robert Watson

There was another really good answer, but I'll let
[Lara spill that one](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=71)
.
