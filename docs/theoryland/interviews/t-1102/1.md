Hey dudes, I have some interesting factoids for you. So, I always make sure to order a signed book from Sam Weller's (now Weller's Bookworks) and ask some sort of ridiculous cosmere question. I strongly believe I've posted what was signed in my Alloy of Law copy, but I honestly can't find it (though it was referenced in one of the first Shardcasts: http://www.17thshard...-is-not-a-d-r91). So, I guess I'm posting that too, again.
In Alloy, I asked: "Give us the name of a Shard's intent we have not seen before."

There is one who just wants to hide and survive.
