## [Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#1)

#### fletchershair

Why is Urithiru safe from the Everstorm?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It's on the east side of a mountain, and it might be high enough to be above the storm. So it's not SAFE, it's safER.

## [Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#2)

#### fletchershair

Now that Nightblood is on Roshar, can it feed off of Stormlight the same way it can off of Breaths?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

He was going to RAFO this, but then he said that because we had already figured it out pretty much he would answer. And the answer is yes. Nightblood will feed on pretty much anything.

## [Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#3)

#### fletchershair

How do you convert between types of Investiture?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

It depends on the types. For example, it's really hard to convert to/from Aons.

## [Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#4)

#### fletchershair

Can you combine Aons?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes.

## [Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#5)

#### fletchershair

How long has Odium been on Roshar?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

He couldn't say for sure without getting out the timeline, but a LONG time.

#### fletchershair

Has he been on Scadrial or Nalthis?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

No, but he is aware of their existence.

## [Entry #6](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#6)

#### fletchershair

Aside from Marsh, is there still Hemalurgy in Alloy of Law era Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

He RAFO'd this one, but then added that yes, it will play a big part.

## [Entry #7](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#7)

#### fletchershair

Out of all your characters, who would you most want to be like, personality-wise?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Dalinar.

## [Entry #8](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1100#8)

#### fletchershair

Is there any chance of queer characters later on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There already are some; Drehy the bridge man is gay and Ranette is some form of queer[he specified it, but I couldn't tell what he said and I had already asked loads of questions and the line was long]. There will definitely be more.

#### Footnote

Brandon has previously mentioned that there is a lesbian in
*The Alloy of Law*
, presumably Ranette.
