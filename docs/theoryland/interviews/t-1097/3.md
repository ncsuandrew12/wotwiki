#### Question (Paraphrased)

Have we seen all of the Heralds?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

I'm pretty sure I've mentioned all of them, and you've seen a number of them, such as Shalash running around [I'm pretty sure he mentioned something that made it clear that it was the Mistress, or the person cutting off the faces]
