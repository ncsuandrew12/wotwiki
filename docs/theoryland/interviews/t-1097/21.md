#### Question (Paraphrased)

So what happens when Shards die?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Well, it depends on how long the Shardholders have held the Shard. After they dies, the Shard is often able to continue acting, a kind of "Cognitive shadow". For example, the mists were able to continue doing what Preservation wished in helping out Vin and snapping people. With the Stormfather, he is that Cognitive shadow, and he's semi sentient. It's that power, but no one is actually holding it. We also see this on Threnody.

#### Footnote

In this case, shardholder means vessel.
