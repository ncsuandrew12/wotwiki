# [Interview #1097: Orem Signing Report - Zas678, Entry #20](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1097#20)

#### Question (Paraphrased)

Is Mraize a worldhopper?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes, he's been to a few planets, highly supervised by his babsk.

#### Question (Paraphrased)

So what planet is she [Iyatil] from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, that's kind of a hard thing to say. She has three planets she's "from". For example, she's living now on Roshar, but then she's from a different planet, but that's not the planet that her people are from.

#### Question (Paraphrased)

So there was a mass exodus to that planet?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Not exactly. If you were to find a Japanese American, where would they say that they are from? Her people did not have a mass exodus.

#### Question (Paraphrased)

Have we seen mass exoduses before?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, there are some in the cosmere. There's a mass exodus that is mentioned in one of the interludes in
*The Way of Kings*
.
