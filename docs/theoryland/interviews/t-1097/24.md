#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

He's actually still unsure about which book the next
*The Stormlight Archive*
is going to be about. He said it might be about Szeth, but then again it might be about Dalinar or Eshonai. He said he was going to have to plot it out a little more and see. He said that the determining factor will be what information are we going to need in order to progress. It might be that he needs to do Dalinar's book because that's the only way to get in some of that information, but Szeth can kind of talk about some of his on screen. He said he'll do a little more plotting and see.
