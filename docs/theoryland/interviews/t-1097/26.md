#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Elantris has a 10th anniversary edition coming out! It's going to have pretty maps and new illustrations, and maybe a couple new line edits.

Alcatraz: Tor has bought the rights, and will re-release Alcatraz 1-4, then release book 5 sometime next year or early 2016.

Shadows of Self: There is a likely date of Oct 2015 for that book.

Calamity (Steelheart 3): That book has a likely early 2016 layout.

Rithmatist 2: He said that he wanted to write this book, but because it's based in this world slightly, he has to use a lot more research. He said he's doing a lot of research of ancient Aztec culture, that it will be held in South America.
