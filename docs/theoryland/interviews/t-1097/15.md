#### Question

Could Shai soul Forge herself into becoming an Elantrian?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

That would be really hard. First of all, she'd have to change where she's born, then soul Forge the fact that she became an Elantrian. Even then, she'd probably look like an Elantrian, but not have any powers. There would probably need to be some kind of bridge, or she would need some kind of super push from AonDor to make it work.
