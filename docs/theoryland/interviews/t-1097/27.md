#### Question

Who's your favorite side character?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

That's a hard one, but I might have to say Syl. Or Wayne! He's just so much fun to write. Oh, and about him, look out for intentional misspellings in
*Shadows of Self*
. My alpha readers skipped completely over them!
