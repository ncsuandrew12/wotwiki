#### Question

So what does the term koloss-blooded mean?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Well, Sazed changed how the koloss reproduced, so now they reproduce naturally, and when the kids come to a coming-of-age, they decide if they’re going to accept the spikes and become a koloss, or if they’re going to stay normal.
