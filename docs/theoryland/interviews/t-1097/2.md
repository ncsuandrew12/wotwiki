#### Zas678

And my other question is about Taravangian. It becomes clear that when he's smart, he's less compassionate, and when he's dumb, he's more compassionate.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yeah, he mentions that in his interlude.

#### Zas678

Is that intentional, or is that just how you believe intelligence works?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Parapharased)

No, that's intentional. There's plenty of really smart people who are also compassionate, and dumb people who aren't.

#### Zas678

So when Taravangian is smart, his Cognitive aspect is stronger. So when heâ€™s dumb, is his Spiritual aspect stronger?
