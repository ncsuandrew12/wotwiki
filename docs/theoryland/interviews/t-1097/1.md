# [Interview #1097: Orem Signing Report - Zas678, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1097#1)

#### Zas678

Can Odium influence people the same way that Ruin can?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

[misunderstands question as a question about kandra/koloss/parshendi] Well, you see, the kandra and the koloss have a "hole" in them that allows Ruin to come in and take over. The Parshendi naturally are protected from this, but when they expose themselves to the storms, and the spren come in, many of these spren have that kind of "hole" in them, and thatâ€™s what allows Odium to take control of them.

#### Zas678

No, I'm talking about how Ruin was able to push people, place things in their minds, stuff like that. Can Odium do the same thing?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Well, Odium wasn't around when those people were created [Here it sounded like the mankind that's on that planet, not the specific generation], so it's a little different for him than Ruin. So if he influences people in that way, it's through the Unmade.
