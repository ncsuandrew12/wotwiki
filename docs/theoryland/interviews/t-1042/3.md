# [Interview #1042: Steelheart Signing Report - askthepaperclip, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=1042#3)

#### Question

Who is your favorite character you have written?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

It is like picking between your children, blah blah, Perrin, blah blah. Picking between my own, I would probably say Dalinar. I started writing a story about Dalinar when I was 15, and then I finally got to write his book years later, so yeah.
