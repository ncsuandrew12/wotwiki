#### Question

Who is your favorite character you have written?

#### Brandon Sanderson (paraphrased)

It is like picking between your children, blah blah, Perrin, blah blah. Picking between my own, I would probably say Dalinar. I started writing a story about Dalinar when I was 15, and then I finally got to write his book years later, so yeah.
