# [Interview #221: KOD Signing Report - Mad Cao, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=221#2)

#### Mad Cao

As far as I know, only one person other than myself asked a plot related question. That question was if it would be possible to complete the
*cuendillar*
chain on the south(?) harbor.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ answered that the joining chain link (which would not yet be
*cuendillar*
) would have to be closed around the existing chain and then turned to heartstone, but the new link could not be touching the old at the start of the change.
