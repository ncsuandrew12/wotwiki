#### [SHAWN J](http://twitter.com/Jonzman/status/121651361644417024)

Not sure if you wish to defend yourself:
[http://www.reddit.com...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/l1wfp/would_you_like_your_name_to_appear_in_a_memory_of/c2p3nf3)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121665414492196864)

Thanks for the heads up.

#### [PETER AZP](http://twitter.com/PeterAzP/status/121645891517030401)

"The auction will be through eBay and 10% of the proceeds will go to the Mayo Clinic" Wait, 10%? What about to the other 90?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121665615583916032)

To Jordancon, a non-profit. (It's all there in the blog post.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121666296675966976)

On the
*A Memory of Light*
name drive: this is PRIMARILY a fund raiser for Jordancon, which Harriet and I believe deserves support.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121666510983929856)

For a while, I've been wanting to do this to help Jordancon make ends meet, as I think it is a great way to honor RJ's name and legacy.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/121667005853081600)

Please note that Jordancon HAS applied to be tax-exempt as a 501(c)3. This means you will probably be able to deduct your donations.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (10 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123587408011862016)

Cindy Goodman, just drew your name to be in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123878622288297984)

Jason Zigmont, I just used (a variation of) your name in
*A Memory of Light*
. Details, for those confused,
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Name)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/123994191570272256)

Glen MacDonald, welcome to the Deathwatch Guard. (
[Explanation](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (13 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124576966098681856)

Running on too little sleep; I'm having trouble getting
*A Memory of Light*
written on the plane. Instead, I'm going to start filling in name placeholders.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124578889946238976)

**Shane Spears**
, you are first. Yes, you will be Aiel. There's really no way I could pass that up.
**Steven Karam**
, you are in
*A Memory of Light*
too.

#### [AUSTIN MOORE](http://twitter.com/Southpaw2014/status/124579240149647361)

So everyone who donates gets their name in? Or are you just selecting a few?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124579987532685312)

Selecting semi-randomly, I'm afraid. Everyone is in 'spiritually' but I won't have enough names for all.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124582128892645376)

**Eric Peters**
, you're in.
**Kimberly Readdy**
, you are wise, are you not?

#### [ALCHEMIST](http://twitter.com/Dinstaardude/status/124581689451229184)

Can you say approximately how many names you will be needing? just so i know just how small my chance is... :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124582213282041856)

Maybe a hundred.

#### [NATHAN SMITH](http://twitter.com/_ndsmith/status/124580129996423168)

What do you have in as placeholders?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124582371327610880)

I use "\*\*\*" to placehold in books, sometimes with one letter at the end to keep different placeheld people straight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124585691312164864)

**Eleanor Pettener**
, you are soon to be wise.
**Laura Hayden**
, you're in.
**Shani Gamble**
, are you a boy or a girl? Name websites can't decide.

#### [JAMES STARKE](http://twitter.com/jeffstarke/status/124584696263868416)

Have you started drawing names for the JordanCon auction? Also, there's no clear date as to when the drawing really "ends" ...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124585994522591232)

Yes, this is for the JordanCon deal. I'm pretty sure that the first cutoff is right. Anyone before then has a chance.

#### [SHIVAM BHATT](http://twitter.com/elektrotal/status/124583772556500993)

How do you decide which names you're going to pick? is it based on sound or?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124586124374065152)

Sometimes, I draw. Others, I just scroll, then stop at a name and work on it a moment. See if it works.

#### [FANTASY AUTHOR](http://twitter.com/AuthorRTkaelin/status/124583174851399680)

(waving hand wildly) How about dropping in a fellow author? Granted, an indie author, but an epic fantasy indie author.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124586369837301760)

Nothing wrong with being indie. But, in this case, I'm only using people who donated.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124588794308599808)

For all still wondering what's up with these names, and how to join in the fun,
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
is that link again.

#### [CHAD ROSENTHAL](http://twitter.com/cyfer13/status/124595059982204928)

Is there a spot where you post the names? Just in case we miss the tweets?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124595703774326784)

I will try to post them all at the end.

#### [ZACAJ](http://twitter.com/zision/status/124594446925971456)

What are the chances of a name getting used if you donate?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/124596040514027520)

Hard to say. It will depend on number of donators and number of names needed. Between 1% and 10% maybe?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (18 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126178900295434240)

**Eric Allen**
, you're in the Tower Guard. Someone just swore at you, but he swears at lots of people. (
[How to get in](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126482462967734272)

**Einar Laastad Kjosavik**
, the good news is you're an Asha'man. The bad news is that one of the Forsaken just balefired you.

#### [SELENE O'ROURKE](http://twitter.com/LenaOR/status/126493763832000513)

So if half my name is a Forsaken's alias, and the other half is an Aiel chief, should I even think about going on the list?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126494952208351232)

Ha. Well, I do change most of the names, so anything can theoretically be used.

#### [JALIL JAMES](http://twitter.com/JalilTerror/status/126496808217227265)

Hey man, so If we donate to the good cause we are guaranteed a spot in the book or names get pulled off the list at random?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/126513945904283648)

Mostly random, I'm afraid. There is one 'sure shot' auction coming up, but last time that went for A LOT of money.

#### [COEN ZUIDERVAART (20 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/CoenZuid/status/127092845436870657)

How many names do you still need in the book? And how many new names are there actually? Was just curious to those numbers.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127098196089511936)

I'll use around a hundred in the book, I think. Still need to choose most of those.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127122260648665088)

**Mikayla Micomonaco**
, congrats! You're in
*A Memory of Light*
. I hope you don't mind being a
*damane*
.
[Details](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127142428711989250)

**Margaret St. John**
, you are a Seanchan general. (Using your maiden name; thanks for providing that. It worked great.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127140350635675648)

**Joff Brown**
, I drew your name next. I made you into a city, actually.

#### [JEFF WEISSBERG](http://twitter.com/corruptcollect/status/127153155812237313)

A "city" in the Blight?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127189744269541378)

*A Memory of Light*
will reveal it for sure.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (21 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127589249628389377)

People are asking how many more names I'll use, as the book is 80% done. I left placeholders in dozens of names earlier that will be filled.

#### [DAMIEN BAUMGART](http://twitter.com/LowmanX/status/127589731772010496)

Are you just dropping names in as is or will they be "Wheel of Time-ified"?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/127620687685894144)

WoT-ified.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (24 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/128564698399510528)

**Alex Prescott**
, you are in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/128580550515638272)

**Jonathan Burt**
and
**Jonathan Brockelman**
, you two are a pair of Whitecloaks.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (25 OCTOBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/128969279679901699)

Need a name for a sister from the Green Ajah. And...the name chosen was David Emery, who entered the name of his late sister,
**Filis**
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/131407930611335168)

The
*A Memory of Light*
[name auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/170721177376?ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649#ht_932wt_932)
has begun. One winner. Or enter the
[drawing](http://brandonsanderson.com/book/A-Memory-of-Light/page/65/A-Memory-of-Light-Names)
, multiple winners.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (3 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132232441359376385)

I am still picking names to go in the book, as per this
[blog post](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/1021/A-MEMORY-OF-LIGHT-Naming-Rights-for-JordanCon-and-the-Mayo-Clinic)
. Should be more of those tonight.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (4 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132474299415150592)

The "Get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
" charity auction had to be restarted due to ebay issues. Here's the
[new link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/170722957609)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/132495802265370625)

Enough people have asked, so it bears repeating. The name auction and the name drawing are different. Explanation
[here](http://brandonsanderson.com/page/65)
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (29 NOVEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/141578261900689409)

Thursday is the final day to enter the drawing to get your name in
*A Memory of Light*

.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (1 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142280057061244929)

Today's the final day to enter the drawing (& support JordanCon) to get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
. Last chance.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142376292111745024)

The drawing to get your name in
*A Memory of Light*
closes to entries in 4 hours. I still have a lot of names to draw.

#### [DAN GOLDMAN](http://twitter.com/Knifelunatic/status/142462574972239872)

How many more names are left to draw?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (2 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/142635970653724673)

Still a good fifty, I'd say.

#### [REBECCA LOVATT](http://twitter.com/Becca_Lovatt/status/149253944038785024)

Have you been using people's names for characters? Haven't seen any posts/updates with that in a long time.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/149255406047342592)

I've been putting in placeholders, and will be drawing out names over the next few months to replace them.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (28 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152137656866844672)

**Shaun Davis**
, I just used your name in
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152140639134416896)

**Shiv Whorra**
, I needed another name, and you're in too.

#### [KELLY](http://twitter.com/cornax/status/152140229422223360)

Is there a running list somewhere of the reader names you've used? And I hope you're feeling completely well soon. : )

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152140712333414402)

We'll post them all once I'm done.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152141056702558208)

For those asking about names: this was done as a fund-raiser for JordanCon, so I'm no longer taking names. (Sorry.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152141375138316288)

[Explanation follows](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/KNgmY/LeXfR/blog/1021/A-MEMORY-OF-LIGHT-Naming-Rights-for-JordanCon-and-the-Mayo-Clinic?m=7&y=2011&d=10)
. (I do this sort of thing for all of my books, though, so there will be chances for other books.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152145187056005120)

**Robert Moreau**
and
**Robert Rose**
, you two are next. Welcome to
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [SIMON ST. ERIC](http://twitter.com/Simonsteric/status/152147326385926144)

It is so exciting to see you pulling the names out of the hat... how many do you think you'll end up using? :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152151647831867392)

Still many more.

#### [BRANDON BALLENGER](http://twitter.com/btballenger/status/152146437080219648)

Since you're not taking names anymore and have a full rough draft, could you make a guess at our odds of being drawn?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152151907467665409)

Really hard to guess. I have about 1,000 placeholders in the book, as told to me by Word, but...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152152059083366400)

Most of those are not "replace a name here" notes, but instead "Look this up" or "describe this better" or "continuity check."

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (29 DECEMBER)](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152518718696587266)

**Brandon Bryant**
, welcome to the Band of the Red Hand. (Unfortunately, we're not accepting new names.
[Details](http://www.mistborn.com/blog/1021/)
)

#### [CHRISTOPHER SKINNER](http://twitter.com/MaverickTempest/status/152519961653420032)

I know no new names—for those of us who put ours in the hat before, how many spots approximately are left? What are our chances?!

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](http://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/152520720260403200)

I have no idea, I'm afraid. There are about 2k people in the drawing. Maybe a hundred names? Rough guesses.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (3 JANUARY 2012)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154338583703060481)

**Daniel Egonsson**
, I drew your name for
*A Memory of Light*
. (Unfortunately, we're not accepting new names. Details: http://www.mistborn.com/blog/1021/)

#### [HUNTER SESTREN](https://twitter.com/HunterSestren/status/154338693157634049)

But for those of us in the drawing we still have a shot right?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154343552988626944)

Yes.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154343465621274624)

**Gavin Doyle**
, you're in too. (Yes, I will eventually post a list of all of these.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154346691947012097)

**Jacob Figler**
, you're next. (Sorry, ladies. I'll draw some female names soon.)

#### [JACOB FIGLER](https://twitter.com/FakeJigler/status/154352694788763648)

Hey that's me!!! Are you saying my name is going to be in
*A Memory of Light*

Yup. You're in the Band of the Red Hand.

#### [JACOB FIGLER](https://twitter.com/FakeJigler/status/154354211759472640)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154355464556134400)

Useful picture. Now I can describe you. :)

#### [JACOB FIGLER](https://twitter.com/FakeJigler/status/154411352407023617)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/154349980658827265)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (12 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156526570025123841)

, you were drawn next.

#### [ROBERT ROTH](https://twitter.com/nomadroth/status/156914122410303488)

Do you or your assistant keep a list of drawn names? Can you post them?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156938966606680065)

I do keep a list, and will post them eventually.

#### [SEAN RYAN](https://twitter.com/SeanRyanIsGreat/status/156910013573632000)

When you write a book do you fill the less important names in later?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/156939118918635520)

Often I do just that. It can break the flow of writing to develop the right name, particularly when I might cut that scene.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (13 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157906743710597121)

**Angela Ryddingwood**
, I have drawn your name.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157967875762688000)

**Bach Payson**
, I put you in
*A Memory of Light*
, but immediately killed you. Sorry 'bout that.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157968540157214720)

Oh, and
**Bryan Ragon**
, same goes for you. You died well, though.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157968954474774528)

**Craig Foster**
, you round out the trio of dead Borderlanders I needed for this scene.

#### [GREG LINDSEY](https://twitter.com/glindsey212/status/157972559349022721)

Just curious Brandon, are the names coming out of the proverbial hat, or do you look for names that can be easily WOTified?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974766588936192)

Most things are pretty easy to wot-ify. And, since I can use either first or last, I haven't yet found any that don't work.

#### [SEAN CORSON](https://twitter.com/smcorson/status/157972027209293824)

Are you changing the names of people you put in
*A Memory of Light*
to make them more "Randland" appropriate?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/157974807747641344)

They are changed.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (16 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/159036169634594818)

**Michael Gonzalez**
, your name came up next. (Yes, I am wot-izing all of these.)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (20 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160485359954825216)

**Mione Haak**
, I drew your name for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160486103781085185)

**Neil Tweed**
, you too.

#### [NEIL TWEED](https://twitter.com/neil_tweed/status/160625571628462080)

Who am I? Dark or light? Do I die well?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160627997878140928)

I try not to use fan names for the shadow very often. I actually named some woods after you.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160628069269381120)

You would have been one of the original owners of the land where the woods were, I should think.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/160624946467438592)

**Nikhil Rode**
and
**Nils Loodin**
, I needed two Aiel scouts.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (23 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161590160243429376)

**Kris Ring**
, you're a member of the Seanchan Blood.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (24 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161730843210039296)

**Johnnie Lee Barrington, Jr.**
and
**Jay Dauro**
, you are members of the Deathwatch Guard.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161751782043815936)

**Paul Benish**
, hope you look good in the
*hadori*
.

#### [DANIEL NELSON](https://twitter.com/ssgt_bus/status/161742193772593153)

I'm confused. You are still using names but won't take anymore? So my name may still come up assuming you aren't done us ...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/161751897156493312)

It very well might. If you are on the list, there is a chance.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (25 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162094063863070720)

**Pia Maria Vaajakallio**
, you are Aes Sedai.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162108833433518081)

**Maureen Sampson**
, you're in the White Tower too.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162378136217071618)

**Natalie Doyle**
, your name came up for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162383930673209345)

**Melissa Bergevin**
, your name came up next.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (26 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162438574959108096)

**Harm Wieringa**
, your name came up next.

#### [SHAUN DUQUETTE](https://twitter.com/MorpheusStone/status/162774177726738432)

Taking a long time to add the names hehe

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (27 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162780893398839296)

I'm doing the first revision, and running across places where I left placeholders instead of names.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162799825803423744)

**Jordan White**
, you're a wolf.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162801352676868096)

**Lindsey Turnbow**
, you too.

#### [M. KLOMPENHOUWER](https://twitter.com/431/status/162808937194852352)

Is anyone keeping track of the names that are being drawn for
*A Memory of Light*
?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/162823017653747712)

Yes, they are. We'll post them eventually.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (30 JANUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164077947869855745)

**Savannah Rose Young**
, you're a Seanchan general.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164078966368505857)

**Sally Rankin**
, your name came up too.

#### [ZACHARY NORTH](https://twitter.com/ZacharyNorth/status/164079412495663104)

They all get changed. Some as little as Thom or Mat (if appropriate.) Some to things very different.

#### [ADAM GOUCHER](https://twitter.com/adamgoucher/status/164083204075171842)

How many names got submitted?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/164087044698685441)

Three thousand, I think.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (6 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166516206680027136)

**Anna Roberts**
and
**Andrew Holcombe**
, I drew your names most recently for
*A Memory of Light*
.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166539307333595137)

**Caitlin Sullivan**
, you're in the White Ajah.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166545178520330240)

**Courtney Gliszczynski**
, your name came up next. I think I'll adapt your first name, not your last, if that's all right...

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166570278770581504)

**Michael Sarcone**
, you asked to be a Darkfriend for some reason, and I obliged.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (7 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/166919906200260608)

**Chris Gilbert**
, you entered your son's name into
*A Memory of Light*
and it has been used.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (8 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167294445115539457)

Drew a bunch of names I didn't report.
**Eric Silva**
,
**Hugh Hill**
,
**Sean Little**
,
**Rion Kinosaki**
,
**Helen Cousins**
,
**Eyal Weinstock**
.

#### [SEAN LITTLE](https://twitter.com/Gaidin_of_SDS/status/167297027464630272)

This is Sean Little, the guy that emailed you previously regarding putting in a group name. Did that entry have...

#### [SEAN LITTLE](https://twitter.com/Gaidin_of_SDS/status/167297065423077376)

...
*San D'ma Shadar*
as the name?

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167313438786334720)

Yes.

#### [SEAN LITTLE](https://twitter.com/Gaidin_of_SDS/status/167313944103497728)

Thank you very much.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167315027722895360)

Trying to figure out the
*San*
in that phrase, though. Is the "San" a name, or a word in the Old Tongue I'm missing?

#### SEAN LITTLE

The translation used on the site (made by our Old Tongue experts) is Slayers of the Shadow. I could ask for the exact translation.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167317668871938048)

That works for me. I actually put the name in a place where it could refer to a group, so I'll tweak it to do so.

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167319363806961665)

Your favorite Two Rivers man, Azi al'Thone, back to bug you again :D I had put in an entry for SDS as well... and since...

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167319538663292928)

...I'm a member of SDS of
[TV.Net](http://TV.Net)
, I'm wondering what (if any) possibility there is of making Azi part of it?

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167319732456923136)

Of course, I understand if that's complicated or doesn't fit with the story—had to ask anyways.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/167327986369040385)

The group is referenced by Mat as being part of a historical battle.

#### [ANTHONY AZIZ](https://twitter.com/aazizorg/status/167328461323649025)

Oh okay! Yes, that would be really hard to make work then :P Thanks for the response, Great Lord :)

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (14 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169549047865147392)

Working on one of the big, climactic sections at the end of
*A Memory of Light*
right now. Not many names left to draw, I'm afraid. A handful, maybe.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169553015987126274)

Remember, there is a special group of Dragonsworn in the Last Battle representing all who donated, so even if you aren't named, you're there.

#### [BRANDON SANDERSON (15 FEBRUARY)](https://twitter.com/BrandSanderson/status/169869351539843072)

**Roger Trask**
and
**Charlie Bachelder**
, turns out I needed two more Aiel to fight in the Last Battle.
