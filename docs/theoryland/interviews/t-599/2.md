# [Interview #599: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Tsunami Relief Auctions, Writing & Illustrating for Young Readers + Updates, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=599#2)

#### Brandon Sanderson

A couple of years ago, I was an instructor at the
[Writing & Illustrating for Young Readers](http://www.wifyr.com/)
conference in Utah. I'm unable to do it again this year in June due to my Europe tour (more on that later as details are finalized), but it's a valuable experience if you want to break in to creating books for children.
[Instructors this year](http://www.wifyr.com/faculty.html)
include Louise Plummer and Holly Black, among others. The workshops are filling up fast, so it's a good idea to
[register](http://www.wifyr.com/registration/)
quickly.
