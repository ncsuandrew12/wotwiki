# [Interview #139: Marcon Report - Sorilea, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=139#2)

#### Ruhira Sedai

You've said before that the blue flashes during the fight with the Myrddraal in Whitebridge were not from Thom's daggers. What were they from?

#### Robert Jordan

RAFO!!!

#### SORILEA

Wow... I agreed with Ruhira that I really thought we should get an answer to this.

#### ROBERT JORDAN

RJ went on to explain that there are three types of ideas that are floating around in his head about the series. Things that he must include, because they are the major turning points for a character, storyline, etc; things he wants to include, because he thinks they give a little more in depth knowledge about a character, etc; and things that would be nice to include. Unfortunately he says that the explanation regarding Thom's daggers falls into the last category. But, on the chance that he will get to include it, he doesn't want to give away anything. So hopefully, this means that at some point, we will revisit Whitebridge and find out some more about it, as well as what the flashes were from.
