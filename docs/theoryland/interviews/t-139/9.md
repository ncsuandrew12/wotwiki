#### Sorilea

Overall, I really enjoyed meeting him, I got my picture taken with him, I will get it up and provide a link for any one who wishes to see RJ, or me, if you've ever been curious of what I look like.

Hope you all enjoy the answers I got, and please feel free to ask me any questions about them.
