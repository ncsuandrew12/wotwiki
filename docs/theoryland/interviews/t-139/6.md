#### Question

Any chance of another short story like
*New Spring*
?

Definitely a possibility. I have two ideas about other novellas. One would be about how Tam ended up finding the child on the mountainside, and why he decided to return to the Two Rivers. The other would be about how Moiraine and Lan wound up in Emond's Field just in the nick of time.

#### SORILEA

Cool I can't wait ;-)
