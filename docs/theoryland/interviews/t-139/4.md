# [Interview #139: Marcon Report - Sorilea, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=139#4)

#### Question

Can you give us an estimate of how many books are left?

#### Robert Jordan

"Well, I'd like to do it in three, if I can, but I'm not promising anything".

He had originally thought that the entire series was going to be only about five books, six at the most (which drew a big laugh from the audience by the way). He said he has always been over-optimistic about how much material he can get in any one book. Which immediately sparked a follow up question by the moderator Friday night: "So based on what you just said, can we really believe you when you say 'Only about 3 more books'? " He basically laughed and said that he'd do his best, but again, was not promising anything.
