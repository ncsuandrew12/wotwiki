#### Patrick

Do you do your own drawings, sketches and pictures?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, though depending on the book, I may have an artist redraw them in order to give a certain stylistic feel to the visuals. In Elantris, I did the symbols myself, but in Mistborn the talented Isaac Stewart did them for me. I always have someone redraw the maps for me.
