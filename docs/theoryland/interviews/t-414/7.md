How does an author eventually get paid for his work? Is it based upon a royalty fee? (Like . . . 50 cents/book sold?) Or is it a one-time payment, . . . just curious.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Usually, it's via an advance against royalties. In other words, you get a chunk of money up front, then earn a percentage off of each book sold. You don't see any of the royalty money until you've earned back the advance money. That can be a long time or a short time, depending on the advance size and the books sold. Once the money you earn off of each book sold adds up to the advance money, you start earning further royalties.
