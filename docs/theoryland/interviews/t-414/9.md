# [Interview #414: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Reader Mail, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=414#9)

How do you know if it is the write career path? (I'm nervous.)

#### Brandon Sanderson

If you spend two or three years writing, and at the end of it have produced a novel or two, that's a good clue. If you can't see yourself doing anything else, if you know you'd keep writing books no matter what happens—even if you never sell a single one—then you know this is the career for you.
