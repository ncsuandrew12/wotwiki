## [Entry #1](./t-221/1)

#### Mad Cao

About 40 people attended the Q&A and book signing at Chester County Books & Music in West Chester, PA. R.J. spoke for about 10 minutes and then answered some general questions from the audience for another 20 minutes. There was only one plot specific question during the open Q&A. Predictably, that question was about Asmodean's condition.

#### Robert Jordan

Everyone had a good laugh, and RJ responded, "Asmodean is dead, dead, dead." All other questions were about RJ's writing process, his daily schedule, what he likes to read, etc.

The next hour was for the book signing. Again, 90% of the questions were about RJ's interests away from the book; his hobbies, suggestions for how to start a career in writing, and things like that.

## [Entry #2](./t-221/2)

#### Mad Cao

As far as I know, only one person other than myself asked a plot related question. That question was if it would be possible to complete the
*cuendillar*
chain on the south(?) harbor.

#### Robert Jordan

RJ answered that the joining chain link (which would not yet be
*cuendillar*
) would have to be closed around the existing chain and then turned to heartstone, but the new link could not be touching the old at the start of the change.

## [Entry #3](./t-221/3)

#### Mad Cao

I asked RJ to expand on Semirhage's actions in Seanchan.

#### Robert Jordan

He answered, in general terms, that she had engineered the complete eradication of the royal line (nothing new here).

## [Entry #4](./t-221/4)

#### Mad Cao

I then asked if Semirhage was somehow immune to the effects of the Crystal Throne.

#### Robert Jordan

He said that she certainly was.

## [Entry #5](./t-221/5)

#### Mad Cao

I have only been to one other WOT book signing, about five years ago, and I thought that RJ seemed much more at ease and more talkative about himself and Harriet at this event. Maybe it was because the audience wasn't hammering away with RAFO questions. We heard several funny anecdotes about Harriet and got several tidbits of advice about life and marriage.

RJ was willing to sign anything he had written or to which he had contributed—even the illustrated guide. He signed old books brought from home as well as the new one from the store (for which they charged $31.50—what a ripoff!). By the end of the hour or so, all books had been signed (including two complete sets for two different fans) and RJ left for his birthday dinner in Philadelphia.

Yes, we did sing Happy Birthday.
