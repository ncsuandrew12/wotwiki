# [Interview #659: KOD Signing Report - Domani Lass, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=659#3)

#### Domani Lass

Great story that he told, and I'll paraphrase since I wasn't smart enough to bring like a tape recorder or anything.

#### Robert Jordan

He goes to Russia and is introduced to an ex-KGB fellow who told Jordan that he thought of his novels not as a bible to politics, but a poetry to the explanation of politics. That was probably the best part of the night when he said that.. and of course it wouldn't come off nearly as good when I say it, lol.
