# [Interview #659: KOD Signing Report - Domani Lass, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=659#1)

#### Domani Lass

Hey guys, long time no chat.. been a few months since I posted and a few years since I was active. Anyways...totally back into it so maybe you'll see me around more/again.

Tonight I dropped in at the Coop for a signing by Robert Jordan and I was really surprised with how he totally didn't fit the perception I'd had of him. Amazing guy, he really was. Shook his hand, he spoke fantastically, just overwhelmed to have met the Creator.

A few things to note of interest:
