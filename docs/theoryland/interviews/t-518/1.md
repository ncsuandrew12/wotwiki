# [Interview #518: JordanCon: Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Richard Fife, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=518#1)

#### Richard Fife

And at last, my friends, we come to the end of my JordanCon interviews. And as is fitting with our beloved series, our ending interview shall be with the man who was tapped, to his own surprise, to bring the Wheel of Time to an ending. Not the ending, mind, we know those donâ€™t exist. And, a reminder requested of me by anonymous sources, this was an audio interview, which is why it reads like . . . well, like it was spoken, and not written and polished. Without further ado, my interview with author Brandon Sanderson.
