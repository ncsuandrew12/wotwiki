# [Interview #518: JordanCon: Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Richard Fife, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=518#2)

#### Richard Fife

What would you say has been the most difficult part of working on the Wheel of Time?

#### Brandon Sanderson

I would say keeping track of all the multitude of characters and subplots. I thought the hardest part might be writing the characters, and indeed that was kind of difficult. It was definitely the most important part: making sure they felt like themselves. But there's so many different Aes Sedai, so many different Wise Ones, so many different named characters, and so many different sub-characters with smaller plots, and they all have different ways of speaking and ways of thinking, and tracking it all is a real challenge.
