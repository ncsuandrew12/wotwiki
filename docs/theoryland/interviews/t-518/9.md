# [Interview #518: JordanCon: Interview with Brandon Sanderson by Richard Fife, Entry #9](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=518#9)

#### Richard Fife

And our last question: without saying R.A.F.O., who killed Asmodean?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Well, without saying R.A.F.O. (except that I just did), I can say truly with no equivocation that Robert Jordan killed Asmodean, and you cannot deny that that is true.

#### Richard Fife

Spoken like a true Aes Sedai.
