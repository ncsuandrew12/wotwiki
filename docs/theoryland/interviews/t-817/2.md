# [Interview #817: WH Signing Report - Fairfax McCandlish, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=817#2)

#### Fairfax McCandlish

I stuck around for a little while longer and got a voice recording of him explaining this, amongst a few other things, which I'll throw on the web in the near future. I didn't get much chance to record anything else, as I had to drive straight back home to drop my brother off for a hockey game.
