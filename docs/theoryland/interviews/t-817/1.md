# [Interview #817, Entry #1]: WH Signing Report - Fairfax McCandlish](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=817#1)

#### Fairfax McCandlish

This was my first RJ signing, at a Tower Books. While I was getting
*The Path of Daggers*
and
*Winter's Heart*
signed, I asked RJ how Narishma could have channeled inside Far Madding to set off their alarms (or was he outside but within the range of the detection
*ter'angreal*
)?

#### Robert Jordan

He corrected me that it was Flinn who channeled (I haven't reread that part of the book yet, and was taking the Seafolk channeler's word on it, as I recalled it), and that he did indeed do so outside the range of the blocking field, but inside the detection range.

#### Footnote

It was Narishma who channeled outside the city. Flinn pretended to channel in the scene where Cadsuane used her Well and Nynaeve's to get Rand out of prison.
