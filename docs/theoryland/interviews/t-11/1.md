# [Interview #11: TSR Signing Report - Brian McKee, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=11#1)

#### Brian McKee

A local (huge!) bookstore here in Dayton called Books & Co. has
*The Shadow Rising*
. I bought it last night, and found out the Robert Jordan was there for a book signing! I wish I had known ahead of time so I could have brought all four in the Wheel of Time series.

#### Robert Jordan

Several people had ALL of his books, including his Conan books and several written under pseudonymsâ€”he mentioned writing westerns and historical (e.g. civil war) novels under the names Reagan [O'Neal] and [Jackson] O'Reilly.
