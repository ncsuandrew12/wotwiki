# [Interview #11: TSR Signing Report - Brian McKee, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=11#2)

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan was quite interesting and personable. He said he used to be an engineer of some kind. He LOOKED and sounded somewhat like a computer-type (a little nerdyâ€”I can say that, since I'm one too :-)). It took FOREVER to get through the few people who were there for the signing (it wasn't advertised, at least not very well), because he took a break between each book he signed to tell a little bit more about himself (which was definitely interesting). Several people asked, of course, how the series was going to end, and, of course, he wouldn't say, except to suggest finding out by buying the book when it's published. He mentioned that there was a special limited edition set of the four books in the series so far being published in leather bound, gold-inset (?) volumes, selling for around $200 (or was it $200 per book?). I think he said only 200 copies would be published (200 seemed to come up a lot in his dialogue :-)).
