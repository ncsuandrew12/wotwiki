# [Interview #691: Ancient 17th Shard Question and Answer, Entry #19](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=691#19)

#### Chaos

Could you tell us a chronology of the Shardworlds thus far? Like, did Warbreaker happen after Mistborn or before, things like that. Personally, I was under the impression you said Mistborn was a sequel to Elantris, but Mi'ch and Josh disagree.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He wasn't positive on where Warbreaker went, but Elantris is first and MB is after it.

#### Footnote

It is commonly believed that until Alloy of Law, the books were published in chronological order.
