#### Chaos

Will Hoid's character arc, as well as the whole Adonalsium arc, get a satisfactory conclusion eventually?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It depends on what Brandon decides to do. We also might or might not get the rest of the story (pre-story). From a market standpoint it's not wise, simply because if the books require you to have read 32 other books before you read them it doesn't make sense to work on them. However, if the demand is high enough he MIGHT do them after all of the rest of the cosmere books.
