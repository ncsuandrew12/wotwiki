#### Chaos

What would have happened if Ruin \*did\* get the atium? Yeah, the world is destroyed, but how does Ruin "absorb" the atium so he can utilize the power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

He would metabolize it, just like the normal people have to do. However, if he did get it he would then be able to destroy the world.
