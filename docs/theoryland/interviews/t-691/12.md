# [Interview #691: Ancient 17th Shard Question and Answer, Entry #12](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=691#12)

#### Chaos

Long, long ago when Hero of Ages came out you listed four Shards other than Ruin and Preservation. You said we interacted with two directly. One is a tough call, we've never met the Shard itself but have seen its power. The other one we've not met directly but have seen its influence. My questions:

-Is the Dor the "tough call" one?

-Do you count Hoid in this list of four shards? It makes a difference for the theories, Brandon! You don't even need to say if he is bound to a shard, rather just if you consider him in this list.

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO, and no, Hoid is not included in the list. (Still not sure if he has a shard or not)

#### Footnote

This refers to the quote made by Brandon in the
