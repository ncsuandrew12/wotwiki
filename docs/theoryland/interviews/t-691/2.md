# [Interview #691: Ancient 17th Shard Question and Answer, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=691#2)

#### Chaos

In the most recent Hero of Ages annotation, you said that Preservation chose Vin to be the recipient of the power, just as Preservation had chosen Alendi previously (thus, this was why Ruin had manipulated the Prophecies). Was Alendi also chosen precisely sixteen years before the Well of Ascension's power returned?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes. He was chosen exactly sixteen years before, but he was a bit older then Vin when he was chosen.
