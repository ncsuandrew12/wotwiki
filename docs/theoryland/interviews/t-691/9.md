#### Chaos

Are Shards all paired? Does Endowment have a counterpart?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO. Also, yes and no. Not all Shards have perfect counterparts like Ruin and Preservation.

#### QUESTION

Why were Ruin and Preservation linked together?

#### BRANDON SANDERSON

Because they're such perfect opposites. Basically it's just an opposites attract thing.
