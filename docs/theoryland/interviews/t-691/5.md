# [Interview #691: Ancient 17th Shard Question and Answer, Entry #5](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=691#5)

#### Chaos

Why is there such an imbalance between the amount of atium and the amount of lerasium in the world? Also, why are atium and lerasium very imbalanced in Allomantic power (Lerasium is far more useful than atium, really)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There isn't. Leras is just spread out further. He is in the mists, in the Well, and in the lerasium. Ruin's power however is considerate strictly in atium.
