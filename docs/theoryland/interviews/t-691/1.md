# [Interview #691: Ancient 17th Shard Question and Answer, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=691#1)

#### Chaos

This Q&A was obtained in May 2010 and was never posted. Josh and Mi'chelle took good notes, but the answers are not direct quotes, rather, the paraphrasing of them. Some stuff here is very outdated (like my question about "imbue"), and so on some things I have put my notes in, to avoid misinformation.
