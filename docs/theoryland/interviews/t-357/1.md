# [Interview #357, Entry #1]: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Warbreaker and A Memory of Light General Updates](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=357#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Folks! I'm hard at work this week on a
*Warbreaker*
revision. It's a fact of the business that you often have to stop what you're working on to do something else, and in this case, we need to have
*Warbreaker*
ready to go by the end of July. That means that I'll be getting only a little bit done on
*A Memory of Light*
, but I will probably have yet another draft of
*Warbreaker*
ready for download in a short while. This will probably be the last one for download, as all changes after this will be done on hard copy and not the computer.
