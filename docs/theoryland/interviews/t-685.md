Following up on an article we posted last week [

## [Entry #2](./t-685/2)

#### Robert Jordan

A thought occurred to me concerning the expansion of
*New Spring*
, something that I should have included in what I wrote to you previously. When I said that I'm doing the story the way I wanted to in the beginning, that also means doing it as if the reader has never read a book of The Wheel of Time. I didn't really find that one page introduction to the world that I had to use in
*Legends*
to be satisfactory. A small point, and obvious once you think about it, but I thought I'd bring it up.

When he was questioned about where a new reader should start reading the series, he replied:

#### Robert Jordan

The expanded
*New Spring*
could serve as starting place, certainly, or any of the three short novels once I have them all completed, and some people may see them as easier since they are (will be) thinner books and less complicated, but I still think of [
*Eye of the World*
] as the proper starting place. I guess it's really up to where [new readers] want to begin.

## [Entry #4](./t-685/4)

#### Jason Denzel

Thanks to RJ for coming to us with this information.

*New Spring*
will probably be published in late 2003 or early 2004. There is no word yet on how it will affect the schedule of Book 11, which has yet to be given a title.
