## Entry #1

#### Khyrindor

Shards can talk to dead people. Are the Tranquiline Halls where everyone in the cosmere goes when they die? Or does each world have its own heaven.

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

There is an afterlife that is not heaven that the Shards don't know about, or can't look into. Each world has its own heaven depending on its religions. The real afterlife is different across the cosmere, and the Tranquiline Halls are different.

## Entry #2

#### Khyrindor

Do the Honourblades reflect the natural pairing of Surges, or did Honor decide which Surge pair to put in each Blade?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

The pairs are natural to Roshar in the same way as the metals on Scadrial.

## Entry #3

#### Khyrindor

Are there Surges that could be considered as God Surges, like the God metals on Scadrial?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes.

#### Khyrindor

Progression and Adhesion, perhaps?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

No, but they could be considered as such.

## Entry #4

#### Khyrindor

Were the Starfarers in
*Sixth of the Dusk*
from a world we've seen?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes. Good question.

## Entry #5

#### Khyrindor

In Dalinar's vision, why did Nohadon make a distinction between Soulcasting and Surgebinding?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Because they are distinct in his [Nohadon's] mind.

## Entry #6

#### Khyrindor

Was Allomancer Jak in the newspapers in
*The Alloy of Law*
just Hoid in disguise?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

No. I actually just published a short story with him in it.

(He also said that he came up with the idea for him in an RPG writing group, or something along those lines.)

#### Footnote

The short story in question is in the Alloy of Law supplement of the Mistborn Adventure Game.

## Entry #7

#### Khyrindor

Can someone accidentally Worldhop?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Yes.

(He thought for a moment first and then said that. I think its more complicated.)

## Entry #8

#### Khyrindor

Did Nalan's eyes change when he killed Ym? (And attempted to kill Lift)

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

(He thought a moment again) No, I don't think so.

## Entry #9

#### Khyrindor

Graves claims that if he had succeeded in killing Elhokar (and done it more quickly), Dalinar would have become an ally of Taravangian. Is there any truth to this idea?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

They are predicting the future. There are people who firmly believe that that would be the case.

## Entry #10

#### Khyrindor

Are the Unmade and the Stormfather the same "class" of being?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

Technically no, but they are on a similar level. It is a good analogy.

## Entry #11

#### Khyrindor

Hoid went through Cultivation's Shardpool to get to Roshar as opposed to Honor's. Yet, he notes he never got along well with Cultivation. Why did he choose her Shardpool rather than Honor's?

#### Brandon Sanderson (Paraphrased)

You're making assumptions!

(I asked if it's possible that it was Honor's and he said it's possible.)
