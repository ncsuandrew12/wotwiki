# [Interview #475: TGS Signing Report - kcf, Entry #10](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#10)

#### Question

Are there any circumstances of death that could prevent the Dark One from resurrecting someone (other than balefire)?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Yes, but I'm not going to tell you what.

This led to a fair amount of discussion about balefire and such. At one point, Brandon said 'all Forsaken other than Sammael who haven't come back were balefired'.

I immediately jumped on this and asked if that included Asmodean—Brandon said that he wasn't talking about Asmodean (we all didn't even want to go there), but this is further evidence of Brandon slipping hints that Asmodean was balefired.

This led to a small debate about Osan'gar—I didn't think he was balefired, everyone else at the table thought he was.
