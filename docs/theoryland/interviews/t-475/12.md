#### Brandon Sanderson

It was also mentioned that balefire does not mean that someone can't be reborn into the Pattern.

I was very surprised by this and hadn't heard it before, but apparently Brandon has said it in previous Q&As.

Brandon said he was also surprised but that Maria was very insistent about thisâ€”so if the Dragon Reborn was balefired, he could still be reborn.
