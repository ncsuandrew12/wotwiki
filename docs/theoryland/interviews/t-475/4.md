# [Interview #475: TGS Signing Report - kcf, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#4)

#### Question

What's up with Rand's sword? Was it Lews Therin Telamon's?

#### Brandon Sanderson

There are some really good theories out there on the message boards and I don't have anything to add on this.

#### kcf

I followed up on where it was found, basically, 'In water, under a statue, not near Falme.'

#### Footnote

Brandon
[confirmed](http://www.dragonmount.com/forums/topic/51901-tgs-signing-tour-qa-plot-related/)
in an email that it was Justice, Artur Hawkwing's sword. It might have been Guaire Amalasan's sword before it was Hawkwing's, which would explain the Dragon scabbard.
