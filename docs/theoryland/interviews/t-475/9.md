#### Question

Tell me what you can about Laras' backstory. Is she an agent of the Kin?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Basically RAFO. Laras is in
*New Spring*
(which I don't remember).

This led to a fair amount of discussion about backstoriesâ€”he doesn't want to spoil something that could be revealed. So, I followed up with something like 'presumably, if the prequels are written, we'll learn more of Laras'. Brandon said yes, presumably.
