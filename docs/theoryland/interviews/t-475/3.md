# [Interview #475: TGS Signing Report - kcf, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#3)

#### Question

Have any characters we've seen been converted to the Shadow via the 13 Myddraal/13 channelers method? Has this method been used at the Black Tower?

#### Brandon Sanderson

RAFO (wow the first question and I got RAFO'd). But he did go on to say that this is a 'gun on the mantle', which refers to an old saying that 'when you put a gun on the mantle in the first act, it needs to be used by the third'.

#### kcf

My interpretation: More on this will come in
*Towers of Midnight*
.
