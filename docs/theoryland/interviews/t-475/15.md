# [Interview #475: TGS Signing Report - kcf, Entry #15](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#15)

#### Question

Where did Cyndane’s new body come from?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Where have any of the new bodies come from? He then mentioned that it's not confirmed who Cyndane is, though he didn't refute me when we all said that it's pretty certain.

I asked about her strength in the One Power—Brandon says she's very, very weak. This surprised me since I didn't think she was that weak.

#### Footnote

She's not; Theorylanders hounded Brandon, and he cleared it up
[here](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=2#2)
. She's weaker than she was, but still stronger than Graendal.
