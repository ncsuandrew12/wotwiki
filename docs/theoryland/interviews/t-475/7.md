#### Question

Can you clear up the timeline issues? How do Mat, Perrin, Rand, and Egwene all match up in the timeline?

#### Brandon Sanderson

*The Gathering Storm*
begins sometime in April. It ends around the end of June/beginning of July. However, Perrin advanced very little—only about two weeks. Mat advanced a bit more, but was still about a month behind Rand and Egwene (this gets an asterisk as a MAFO), but Mat traveled to Caemlyn about 30 days before the end of the book—he emphasized 30 days and asked if I understood the significance of that—I said that I do. (Interpretation: Mat will open Verin’s letter very early in
*Towers of Midnight*
).

Tuon's timeline jumps around the most. In
*Knife of Dreams*
, she ended about a month ahead of everyone else. There were probably (MAFO) about two weeks between her meeting with Rand and the launch of the attack on the White Tower.

That sounds about right to me.
