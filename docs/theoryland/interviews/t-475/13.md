# [Interview #475, Entry #13]: TGS Signing Report - kcf](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#13)

#### Question

Did Rand directly have the Dark One's permission to channel the True Power?

#### Brandon Sanderson

It's very difficult (but not impossible) to channel the True Power without the Dark One's direct permission.

This led to lots of discussion about the whole Semirhage death scene. Basically, she felt betrayed by the Dark One, and Brandon says she's a very astute person. Brandon also said that Moridin and the Dark One are on the same page with most things, and that Moridin is the most trustworthy Forsaken for the Dark One.

#### kcf

My interpretation is that Rand channeled the True Power through the link with Moridin, but this was not discussed. Also it was strongly implied that the idea that the Dark One served Semirhage up on a platter for Rand to balefire is true.
