# [Interview #475: TGS Signing Report - kcf, Entry #2](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#2)

#### kcf

OK, on to the Q&A. The questions and answers are not exact, but I was taking notes (not that I can read my chicken scratch). I will also include my own commentary and interpretation. Brandon very much wants to be forthcoming with answers—he doesn't seem to like RAFO. Mostly it would be something like, 'I can't answer that, but I will say...'

Unfortunately, I didn't get to ask many spoilery questions about
*The Gathering Storm*
because one Storm Leader hadn't finished yet—this means that my craving for more info about Verin, the Black Ajah, and such was not meant to be. The questions below are what I intended to ask—I didn't necessarily ask them word for word as written—and many are from suggestions here and at RAFO.com.
