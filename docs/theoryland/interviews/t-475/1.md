# [Interview #475: TGS Signing Report - kcf, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=475#1)

Here's a summary of my Q&A and other time spent with Brandon as a Storm Leader. (It may warrant its own post, but I'll post it here first and we go from there).

There will eventually be a pretty detailed blog post about me meeting Brandon and the whole Storm Leader experience, but that'll be a few days coming.

I will say that meeting and 'hanging out' with Brandon was both a privilege and an honor. He's a very nice guy that immediately knew who I was from my blog—which led to my exclaiming to the group, 'he's heard of me'. Later he said that he was very happy to see that I had been chosen a Storm Leader, umm, wow, that was pretty cool. We (fans) need to all be extremely thankful to Brandon for doing this—he is on tour for four weeks away from his family, literally being in an airport on planes every day, eating out all the time, etc. The toll is beginning to show, so we need to all express our gratitude for what he's been doing for the fans. For
*Towers of Midnight*
, expect a shorter tour—two weeks, with another two-week tour for
*The Way of Kings*
.
