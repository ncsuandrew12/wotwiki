#### Question

You mentioned that Shaidar Haran has quite a few limitations on his power. Can you give us a few concrete examples of these limitations?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Shaidar Haran needs a minion to most of his work for him. Elza was essential to Shaidar Haran in getting things done.

This led to lots of discussion about swearing to the Shadowâ€”basically, it's a very bad idea and you forfeit some very basic protections when you do. Shaidar Haran has special power over those that swear to the Dark One, and the Forsaken in particular.

I asked about Alvairin's special mark, and he said Shaidar Haran has similar power over her. The implication is that there are lots of ramifications for swearing to the Dark One. Brandon mentioned that this makes Verin all the more remarkable.
