# [Interview #241: KOD Signing Report - Frenzy, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=241#1)

#### Frenzy

Don't ask. I have weird friends. :p

Here are a few pictures from the signing. JWB got there early, so we got primo spots in line. We were singing along a bit when Jordan was reiterating some of the pronunciations and announcements he's said at other signings (and have been reported here and elsewhere).

#### Robert Jordan

He looked at us and said (paraphrased), "some of you have seen the websites."
