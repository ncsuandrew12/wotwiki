# [Interview #241: KOD Signing Report - Frenzy, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=241#3)

#### Frenzy

But what I DID get to ask, was this: Can a person who hasn't actively channeled yet be severed or stilled?

#### Robert Jordan

Jordan's response (paraphrased) "No, you have to have something to take away something, so a person has to have an active connection to the Source to be able to have it cut."

#### Frenzy

Oh, the mayhem I can have with this little nugget.

small: This explains why the Reds haven't summarily tried to gentle every boy at birth or every man by 30.

big: If it takes an active link to the Source to slow, or to be stilled, then what about all those other attributes that
*sul'dam*
gain with use of the
*a'dam*
? Where do they come from? How did they get there?

bigger: Is it possible that those attributes are NOT directly linked to the Source? Could it be merely the exposure to the One Power that gives
*sul'dam*
that ability? What about a Warder? Could a same-sex non-channeling warder develop those attributes over time?

I need sleep now, I'll ponder this more later.
