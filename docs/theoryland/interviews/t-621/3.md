# [Interview #621: WorldCon 2011 WoT Panel - Linda Taglieri, Entry #3](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=621#3)

#### Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson had to write a spanking scene in
*The Gathering Storm*
â€”the one where Cadsuane spanks Semirhage. RJ's instructions on this scene were specific.

#### Linda Taglieri

I think Brandon would have rather it were Semirhage punishing Cadsuane.
