# [Interview #621, Entry #2]: WorldCon 2011 WoT Panel - Linda Taglieri](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=621#2)

#### Linda Taglieri

Wheel of Time

Brandon Sanderson, Matt Hatch (moderating) and myself discussed the influence the Wheel of Time has had on the fantasy genre over the twenty years it has been running. Our panel was quite well attended, considering it was so late in the Con program. Thanks to all who came along.

#### Brandon Sanderson

Brandon began by recounting how he came to be Chosen to finish the series. Then we discussed the various ways that The Wheel of Time series was groundbreaking: not only size, but complexity and also subtlety.
