# [Interview #906: Brandon Sanderson Interview, Entry #4](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=906#4)

#### Sean

Do you devote all of your writing time to the current book you're working on? If not, how much time do spend on books that won't be coming out for years to come either outlining, world-building, or even writing them?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Because I'm trying hard to finish The Wheel of Time right now, all of my writing time is spent on that. However, at other times I might be writing one book, revising another book and brainstorm a third. As a writer I'm essentially always writing or thinking about writing pretty much all of the time.
