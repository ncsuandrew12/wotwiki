How well do Elhokar and Jasnah get on?

#### Brandon Sanderson

Fine, I would say. This is a bit of a spoiler for the end of
*Words of Radiance*
, but you will eventually see that they're the sort of siblings who are both used to doing their own thing and getting their own way. They've both learned to stay out of one another's business. That said, Elhokar is also used to being surrounded by domineering people of various sorts. So having a domineering sister is really nothing different to him.
