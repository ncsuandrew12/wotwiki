# [Interview #731: KOD Signing Report - Saladdodger, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=731#1)

#### Saladdodger

First I want to applaud the OP for a well thought out
[theory](http://www.theoryland.com/theories.php?func=5&rec=131&theo=2372)
supported by evidence. I have enjoyed the debate on this topic.

Now the bad news: I attended the Robert Jordan book signing here in Charlotte, NC tonight (11/4/05). While he was signing my books, I asked him if he could credit or discredit the theory that the Dark One charged Demandred with the task of wielding Balefire in an attempt to weaken the Pattern, so that the Dark One may be have a better chance of victory at Tarmon Gai'don.

#### Robert Jordan

He didn't quite understand my point and asked me to explain it again. When I did, alluding to the consequences of Balefire, and quoting the Dark One's asking Demandred about his willingness to use balefire for the Dark One, he quickly shook his head and gave an unequivocal no.

#### SALADDODGER

I'm afraid this theory is disproved by the word of Robert Jordan himself.

#### Footnote

It's clear enough from
[other reports](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=730)
and also from
[comments by Brandon](http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=36#36)
that the theory was not precisely disproven. RJ probably meant that Demandred was not the one doing the balefiring, which fits with Brandon's comments.
