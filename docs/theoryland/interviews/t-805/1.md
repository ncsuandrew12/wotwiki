# [Interview #805: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: San Diego Comic-Con, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=805#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This is the first year I've been a Special Guest at SDCC. On top of that,
[Gen Con](http://www.gencon.com/2012/indy/pm/events/ligoh/AuthorGoH.aspx)
has me as their Author Guest of Honor and
[Dragon\*Con](http://dragoncon.org/dc_guest_detail.php?id=1782)
is bringing me in (for the third time) as an invited guest. With this conflux of awesome conventions happening, I wanted to do some special things. For years, I've wanted to do con exclusivesâ€”something to make it worth the effort for people to go out of their way to come see me. And so, this year, we have some awesome things going on. Read below for an expanded list of my SDCC activities.

I do realize that not everyone can make conventions like this, and I'll do my best to make some of these items available to those of you who can't come. However, I'd like to make the con experience a great one for all involved. In addition to simply attending SDCC this year, I have a booth (for the first time) provided for me in Artist's Alley (#II-10). Isaac, who does much of my artwork, and his wife have decided to come and run the booth. I'm hoping this will prove lucrative enough for them that we can do things like this in the future. So please, do come stop by and see us. We will have freebies every day and awesome merchandise. If you know someone who is going to SDCC, send them by to pick something up for you!
