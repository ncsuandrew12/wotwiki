#### Brandon Sanderson

#### EXCLUSIVE FIVE:

Szeth Shirt (from
*The Way of Kings*
)
  
Launching at SDCC will be the new Szeth shirt from The Way of Kings. Wear the Assassin in White proudly on your torso. :) This shirt is based off of the concept art Ben (
[Inkthinker](http://inkthinker.net/)
) McSweeney did for Szeth when I pitched the series to Tor. I loved his rendition of Szeth so much, we ended up using Ben's image for the Szeth chapter icon in the books.

These will be for sale eventually on
[InkWing](http://inkwing.com/)
's website. But for now, the place to get them is SDCC!
