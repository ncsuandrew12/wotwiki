#### Brandon Sanderson

#### OTHER THINGS FOR SALE

We will have copies of almost all of my books for sale at the booth, along with another T-shirt (the Matrim Cauthon by Seamas shirt from
[Ta'veren Tees](https://taverentees.com/threads/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=3&products_id=53)
). Prices for those will be the same as online. In addition, we've packed up a few foreign language editions. There are only a few of these, but I believe there is at least one book each in French, Japanese, Chinese (complex), and Spanish. So if you've been wanting an edition of my books in a different language, come early and snatch your copy up! There's also one set of the GraphicAudio version of
*Elantris*
.
