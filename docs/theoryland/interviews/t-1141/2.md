#### Jaller

I also asked Brandon about that part in the Wandersail chapter of WoK, where Syl leaves Kaladin before he meets Hoid because she gets a bad feeling. I wanted to know whether this related to why Vin decided to not meet Hoid in HoA.

#### Brandon Sanderson

He said that they both got a certain impression from him, but wouldn't say whether or not it was the same thing, and stated I would have to RAFO what that was exactly.
