# [Interview #992: Brandon Sanderson's Blog: Stormlight Videos + Updates, Entry #1](https://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=992#1)

#### Brandon Sanderson

This past weekend I had a great time at JordanCon. Next year's Author Guest of Honor will be Patrick Rothfuss, with Artist Guest of Honor Larry Elmore. It should be awesome.

While I was there I signed a number of books for two booksellers, The Missing Volume and Basement Books. They each also have a handful of copies of my
*Firstborn/Defending Elysium*
convention exclusiveâ€”but I forgot to sign those. Whoops. Still, if you're not at a con, this is the only way to get your hands on that hardcover until much later this year. Both booksellers will ship to you.
