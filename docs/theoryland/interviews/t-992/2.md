The latest Writing Excuses podcast is another
[brainstorming episode](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2013/04/21/)
, where Mary, Howard, and Dan help me come up with ideas for a story about psychic birds. Enjoy. And yes, I did end up writing this story (a novelette) after doing the podcast. More on that in the future.
