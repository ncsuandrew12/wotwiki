of their reread of
*The Way of Kings*
: chapters 3 and 4. This covers Shallan's introduction and Kaladin's arrival at the Shattered Plains.

I've finished uploading the videos of me writing one of the interludes from
*Words of Radiance*
, the sequel to
*The Way of Kings*
. I've also made a
[high-speed version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNHe1BElX-g&hd=1)
of all of the writing, which you can see below, if the real-time version was too slow for you. There's a playlist of all of the real-time videos
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHlPczUmjrQ&hd=1&list=PLSH_xM-KC3ZviGuhA9pT7ETB481Fw-VEL)
, and the final video (if you were keeping up already) is
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE6FR9y5oo0&hd=1)
.

This has been a bit of an experiment, to show my writing process. Now that it's all done, what have you thought about the experiment?
