#### Invisible Vanguard

Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy author who published his first book,
[*Elantris*](http://www.amazon.com/Elantris-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0765350378/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1341081086&sr=8-1&keywords=elantris)
, in 2005. Since then he has released several more successful books, including the
[Mistborn Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/Mistborn-Trilogy-Boxed-Hero-Ascension/dp/076536543X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341081422&sr=1-1&keywords=mistborn+trilogy)
, and
[*The Way of Kings*](http://www.amazon.com/Way-Kings-Stormlight-Archive/dp/0765365278/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341081176&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Way+of+Kings)
, the first part of an estimated ten-book series. In 2007 he was given the honor of completing the Wheel of Time series after the original author, Robert Jordan, passed away before its completion. Mr. Sanderson co-hosts a podcast at the website
[Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/)
, and teaches a creative writing class on fantasy and science fiction at Brigham Young University. Even with all that on his plate, he was gracious enough to set some time aside to answer a few questions for us regarding what psychs him out as a writer, how he plans to avoid 'epic sprawl' and sagely advice for new writers trying to squeeze their way into the epic fantasy market.
